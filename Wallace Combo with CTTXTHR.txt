of Species to form Varieties, * the essay of 1844 (extracts
from which form part of the paper) is said to have been
sketched in 1839, and copied in 1844. This statement is
obviously made on the authority of a note written in my
fathers hand across the Table of Contents of the 1844 Essay.
It is to the following effect : This was sketched in 1839, and
copied out in full, as here written and read by you in 1844.
I conclude that this note was added in 1858, when the MS.
was sent to Sir J. D. Hooker (see Letter of June 29, 1858,
Vol. II. p. 1 19). There is also some further evidence on this side
of the question. CTTXTHR Writing to Mr. Wallace (Jan. 25, 1859) my
father says :   Every one whom I have seen has thought
your paper very well written and interesting. It puts my
extracts (written in 1839, now just twenty years ago !), which
I must say in apology were never for an instant intended for
publication, into the shade. The statement that the earliest
sketch was written in 1839 has been frequently made in
biographical notices of my father, no doubt on the authority
of the  Linnean Journal, but it must, I think, be considered
as erroneous. The error may possibly have arisen in this
way. In writing on the Table of Contents of the 1844 MS.
that it was sketched in 1839, I think my father may have
intended to imply that the framework of the theory was clearly
thought out by him at that date. In the Autobiography
(p. 88) he speaks of the time,  about 1839, when the theory
was clearly conceived, meaning, no doubt, the end of 1838
and beginning of 1839, when the reading of Malthus had
given him the key to the idea of natural selection. But this
explanation does not apply to the letter to Mr. Wallace ; and
with regard to the passage t in the 'Linnean Journal it is
difficult to understand how it should have been allowed to

remain as it now stands, conveying, as it clearly does, the
impression that 1839 was the date of his earliest written sketch.
The sketch of 1844 is written in a clerks hand, in two
hundred and thirty-one pages folio, blank leaves being
alternated with the MS. with a view to amplification. The
text has been revised and corrected, criticisms being pencilled
by himself on the margin. It is divided into two parts : I.  On
the variation of Organic Beings under Domestication and in
their Natural State. II. On the Evidence favourable and
opposed to the view that Species are naturally formed races
descended from common Stocks. The first part contains the
main argument of the  Origin of Species. It is founded, as is
the argument of that work, on the study of domestic animals,
and both the Sketch and the  Origin  open with a chapter
on variation under domestication and on artificial selection.
This is followed, in both essays, by discussions on variation
under nature, on natural selection, and on the struggle for
life. Here, any close resemblance between the two essays
with regard to arrangement ceases. Chapter III. of the
Sketch, which concludes the first part, treats of the varia-
tions which occur in the instincts and habits of animals,
and thus corresponds to some extent with Chapter VII. of
the Origin (ist edit.). It thus forms a complement to
the chapters which deal with variation in structure. It seems
to have been placed thus early in the Essay to prevent the
hasty rejection of the whole theory by a reader to whom
the idea of natural selection acting on instincts might seem
impossible. This is the more probable, as the Chapter on
Instinct in the  Origin  is specially mentioned (Introduction,
p. 5) as one of the  most apparent and gravest difficulties on
the theory. Moreover the chapter in the Sketch ends with
a discussion, whether any particular corporeal structures
are so wonderful as to justify the rejection //-��>��(} facie
of our theory. Under this heading comes the discussion of
the eye, which in the  Origin  finds its place in Chapter VI.

under " Difficulties on Theory. The second part seems to
have been planned in accordance with his favourite point of
view with regard to his theory. This is briefly given in a
letter to Dr. Asa Gray, November nth, 1859: I cannot
possibly believe that a false theory would explain so many
classes of facts, as I think it certainly does explain. On these
grounds I drop my anchor, and believe that the difficulties
will slowly disappear. On this principle, having stated the
theory in the first part, he proceeds to show to what extent
various wide series of facts can be explained by its means.
Thus the second part of the Sketch corresponds roughly
to the nine concluding Chapters of the First Edition of the
Origin. But we must exclude Chapter VII. (Origin) on
Instinct, which forms a chapter in the first part of the Sketch,
and Chapter VIII. (Origin) on Hybridism, a subject treated
in the Sketch with Variation under Nature  in the first part.
The following list of the chapters of the second part of the
Sketch will illustrate their correspondence with the final
chapters of the  Origin.
Chapter I. On the kind of intermediateness necessary,
and the number of such intermediate forms.
This includes a geological discussion, and corresponds to
parts of Chapters VI. and IX. of the  Origin.
Chapter II.  The gradual appearance and disappearance
of organic beings. Corresponds to Chapter X. of the
Chapter III.  Geographical Distribution. Corresponds to
Chapters XI. and XII. of the  Origin.
Chapter IV.  Affinities and Classification of Organic
beings.
Chapter V.  Unity of Type, Morphology, Embryology.
Chapter VI. Rudimentary Organs.
These three chapters correspond to Chapter XII. of the

sentence of tlie Sketch, which we saw in its first rough
form in the Note Book of 1837, closely resembles the final
sentence of the  Origin, much of it being identical. The
 Origin  is not divided into two " Parts, but we see traces of
such a division having been present in the writers mind, in
this resemblance between the second part of the Sketch and
the final chapters of the  Origin. That he should speak * of
the chapters on transition, on instinct, on hybridism, and
on the geological record, as forming a group, may be due to
the division of his early MS. into two parts.
Mr. Huxley, who was good enough to read the Sketch at
my request, while remarking that the  main lines of argu-
ment and the illustrations employed are the same, points
out that in the 1844 Essay,  much more weight is attached to
the influence of external conditions in producing variation^
and to the inheritance of acquired habits than in the
 Origin.
It is extremely interesting to find in the Sketch the first
mention of principles familiar to us in the  Origin of Species.
Foremost among these may be mentioned the principle of
Sexual Selection, which is clearly enunciated. The important
form of selection known as  unconscious, is also given.
Here also occurs a statement of the law that peculiarities

that at which they occurred in the parent
Professor Newton, who was so kind as to look through the
1844 Sketch, tells me that my fathers remarks on the migra-
tion of birds, incidentally given in more than one passage,
show that he had anticipated the views of some later writers.
With regard to the general style of the Sketch, it is not
to-be expected that it should have all the characteristics of
the Origin, and we do not, in fact, find that balance and
control, that concentration and grasp, which are so striking
in the work of 1859.

PRINCIPLE OF DIVERGENCE.
In the Autobiography (Vol. I. p. 84) my father has stated
what seemed to him the chief flaw of the 1844 Sketch; he
had overlooked one problem of great importance, the
problem of the divergence of character. This point is dis-
cussed in the  Origin of Species, but, as it may not be familiar
to all readers, I will give a short account of the difficulty and
its solution. The author begins by stating that varieties
differ from each other less than species, and then goes on :
 Nevertheless, according to my view, varieties are species in
process of formation How then does the lesser dif-
ference between varieties become augmented into the greater
difference between species. * He shows how an analogous
divergence takes place under domestication where an originally
uniform stock of horses has been split up into race-horses,
dray-horses, &c., and then goes on to explain how the same
principle applies to natural species. From the simple
circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from
any one species become in structure, constitution, and habits,
by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and
widely diversified places in the polity of nature, and so be
enabled to increase in numbers.
The principle is exemplified by the fact that if on one plot
of ground a single variety of wheat be sown, and on to
another a mixture of varieties, in the latter case the produce
is greater. More individuals have been able to exist because
they were not all of the same variety. An organism becomes
more perfect and more fitted to survive when by division
of labour the different functions of life are performed by
different organs. In the same way a species becomes more
efficient and more able to survive when different sections of
the species become differentiated so as to fiil different stations.
In reading the Sketch of 1844, I have found it difficult to
recognise, as a flaw in the Essay, the absence of any definite
statement of the principle of divergence. Descent with

modification implies divergence, and we become so habituated
to a belief in descent, and therefore in divergence, that we
do not notice the absence of proof that divergence is in itself
an advantage. As shown in the Autobiography, my father
in 1876 found it hardly credible that he should have over-
looked the problem and its solution.

XIn the Autobiographical chapter (Vol. I. p. 84) my father

views pretty fully, and I began at once to do so on a scale
three or four times as extensive as that which was afterwards

abstract of the materials which I had collected. The letters
in the present chapter are chiefly concerned with the prepara-
tion of this unfinished book.
The work was begun on May 14th, and steadily continued
up to June 1858, when it was interrupted by the arrival of
Mr. Wallaces MS. During the two years which we are now
considering, he wrote ten chapters (that is about one-halQ of

LETTERS.
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to A. R. Wallace.
Moor Park, May 1st, 1857.
My dear Sir,  I am much obliged for your letter of
October 10th, from Celebes, received a few days ago ; in a
laborious undertaking, sympathy is a valuable and real en-
couragement. By your letter and even still more by your
paper * in the Annals, a year or more ago, I can plainly see
that we have thought much alike and to a certain extent have
come to similar conclusions. In regard to the Paper in the
Annals, I agree to the truth of almost every word of your
paper ; and I dare say that you will agree with me that it is
very rare to find oneself agreeing pretty closely with any
theoretical paper ; for it is lamentable how each man draws
his own different conclusions from the very same facts. This
summer will make the 20th year (!) since I opened my first
note-book, on the question how and in what way do species-
and varieties differ from each other. I am now preparing my
work for publication, but I find the subject so very large, that
though I have written many chapters, I do not suppose I
shall go to press for two years. I have never heard how long
you intend staying in the Malay Archipelago ; I wish I might
profit by the publication of your Travels there before my
work appears, for no doubt you will reap a large harvest of
facts. I have acted already in accordance with your advice
of keeping domestic varieties, and those appearing in a state
of nature, distinct ; but I have sometimes doubted of the.
wisdom of this, and therefore I am glad to be backed by your
opinion. I must confess, however, I rather doubt the truth

of the now very prevalent doctrine of all our domestic animals
having descended from several wild stocks ; though I do not
doubt that it is so in some cases. I think there is rather
better evidence on the sterility of hybrid animals than you
seem to admit : and in regard to plants the collection of
carefully recorded facts by Kolreuter and Gaertner (and
Herbert) is enormous. I most entirely agree with you on the
little effects of  climatal conditions, which one sees referred
to ad nauseam in all books ; I suppose some very little effect
must be attributed to such influences, but I fully believe that
they are very slight It is really impossible to explain my
views (in the compass of a letter), on the causes and means of
variation in a state of nature ; but I have slowly adopted a
distinct and tangible idea,  whether true or false others must
judge : for the firmest conviction of the truth of a doctrine by
its author, seems, alas, not to be the slightest guarantee of
truth 1 . . .
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to A. R. Wallace.
Down, Dec. 22nd, 1857.
My dear Sir,  I thank you for your letter of Sept 27th.
I am extremely glad to hear that you are attending to distri-
bution in accordance with theoretical ideas. I am a firm
believer that without speculation there is no good and original
observation. Few travellers have attended to such points as
you are now at work on ; and, indeed, the whole subject of ,
distribution of animals is dreadfully behind that of plants.
You say that you have been somewhat surprised at no notice
having been taken of your paper in the Annals.* I cannot say
that I am, for so very few naturalists care for anything beyond
the mere description of species. But you must not suppose
that your paper has not been attended to : two very good
men. Sir C. Lyell, and Mr. E. Blyth at Calcutta, specially
called my attention to it Though agreeing with you on your
conclusions in that paper, I believe I go much further than
you ; but it is too long a subject to enter on my speculative
notions. I have not yet seen your paper on the distribution
of animals in the Aru Islands. I shall read it with the
utmost interest ; for I think that the most interesting quarter
of the whole globe in respect to distribution, and I have long
been very imperfectly trying to collect data for the Malay
Archipelago. I shall be quite prepared to subscribe to your

doctrine of subsidence ; indeed, from the quite independent
evidence of the Coral Reefs I coloured my original map (in my
Coral volume) of the Aru Islands as one of subsidence, but
got frightened and left it uncoloured. But I can see that you
are inclined to go much further than I am in regard to the
former connection of oceanic islands with continents. Ever
since poor E. Forbes propounded this doctrine, it has been
eagerly followed ; and Hooker elaborately discusses the
former connection of all the Antarctic Islands and New Zea-
land and South America. About a year ago I discussed this
subject much with Lyell and Hooker (for I shall have to treat
of it), and wrote out my arguments in opposition ; but you
will be glad to hear that neither Lyell nor Hooker thought
much of my arguments. Nevertheless, for once in my life,
I dare withstand the almost preternatural sagacity of Lyell.
You ask about land-shells on islands far distant from con-
tinents : Madeira has a few identical with those of Europe,
and here the evidence is really good, as some of them are sub-
fossil. In the Pacific Islands there are cases of identity, which
I cannot at present persuade myself to account for by intro-
duction through mans agency ; although Dr. Aug. Gould has
conclusively shown that many land-shells have thus been
distributed over the Pacific by mans agency. These cases of
introduction are most plaguing. Have you not found it so in
the Malay Archipelago? It has seemed to me in the lists of
mammals of Timor and other islands, that several in all pro-
bability have been naturalised. . . .
You ask whether I shall discuss man. I think I shall
avoid the whole subject, as so surrounded with prejudices ;
though I fully admit that it is the highest and most interesting
problem for the naturalist. My work, on which I have now
been at work more or less for twenty years, will not fix or
settle anything ; but I hope it will aid by giving a large col-
lection of facts, with one definite end. I get on very slowly,
partly from ill-health, partly from being a very slow worker.

their white stems, and a fringe of distant green from the

asleep on the grass, and awoke with a chorus of birds singing
around me, and squirrels running up the trees, and some
woodpeckers laughing, and it was as pleasant and rural a
scene as ever I saw, and I did not care one penny how any of
the beasts or birds had been formed. I sat in the drawing-
room till after eight, and then went and read the Chief
Justices summing up, and thought Bernard * guilty, and then
read a bit of my novel, which is feminine, virtuous, clerical,
philanthropical, and all that sort of thing, but very decidedly
flat. I say feminine, for the author is ignorant about money
matters, and not much of a lady  for she makes her men say,
 My Lady. I like Miss Craik very much, though we have
some battles, and differ on every subject I like also the
Hungarian ; a thorough gentleman, formerly attache at Paris,

The weather is quite delicious. Yesterday, after writing to

and enjoyed myself  the fresh yet dark-green of the grand
Scotch firs, the brown of the catkins of the old birches, with
their white stems, and a fringe of distant green from the
larches, made an excessively pretty view. At last I fell fast
asleep on the grass, and awoke with a chorus of birds singing
around me, and squirrels running up the trees, and some
woodpeckers laughing, and it was as pleasant and rural a
scene as ever I saw, and I did not care one penny how any of
the beasts or birds had been formed. I sat in the drawing-
room till after eight, and then went and read the Chief
Justices summing up, and thought Bernard * guilty, and then
read a bit of my novel, which is feminine, virtuous, clerical,
philanthropical, and all that sort of thing, but very decidedly
flat. I say feminine, for the author is ignorant about money
matters, and not much of a lady  for she makes her men say,
 My Lady. I like Miss Craik very much, though we have
some battles, and differ on every subject I like also the
Hungarian ; a thorough gentleman, formerly attache at Paris,
and then in the Austrian cavalry, and now a pardoned exile,
with broken health. He does not seem to like Kossuth, but
says, he is certain [he is] a sincere patriot, most clever and
eloquent, but weak, with no determination of character. . . .

My DEAR Lyell,  Some year or so ago you recommended
me to read a paper by Wallace in the Annals, * which had
interested you, and, as I was writing to him, I knew this
would please him much, so I told him. He has to-day sent
me the enclosed, and asked me to forward it to you. It seems
to me well worth reading. Your words have come true with a
vengeance  that I should be forestalled. You said this, when
I explained to you here very briefly my views of  Natural
Selection  depending on the struggle for existence. I never
saw a more striking coincidence ; if Wallace had my MS.
sketch written out in 1842, he could not have made a better
short abstract I Even his terms now stand as heads of my
chapters. Please return me the MS., which he does not say
he wishes me to publish, but I shall, of course, at once write
and offer to send to any journal. So all my originality, what-

give me your deliberate opinion, you will do me as great a
service as ever man did, for I have entire confidence in your
judgment and honour. . . .
There is nothing in Wallaces sketch which is not written
out much fuller in my sketch, copied out in 1844, and leAd by
Hooker some dozen years ago. About a year ��^o I sent a
short sketch, of which I have a copy, of my views (owing to
correspondence on several points) to Asa Gray, so that I could
most truly say and prove that I take nothing from Wallace.
I should be extremely glad now to publish a sketch of my
general views in about a dozen pages or so ; but I cannot
persuade myself that I can do so honourably. Wallace says
nothing about publication, and I enclose his letter. But as I
had not intended to publish any sketch, can I do so honourably,
because Wallace has sent me an outline of his doctrine ? I
would far rather bum my whole book, than that he or any
other man should think that I had behaved in a paltry spirit
Do you not think his having sent me this sketch ties my
hands? .... If I could honourably publish, I would state
that I was induced now to publish a sketch (and I should be

general conclusions. We differ only, [in] that I was led to my

Gray, to show him that I had not stolen his doctrine. But 1
cannot tell whether to publish now would not be base and
paltry. This was my first impression, and I should have
certainly acted on it had it not been for your letter.
This is a trumpery affair to trouble you with, but you
cannot tell how much obliged I should be for your advice.
By the way, would you object to send this and your answer
to Hooker to be fortvarded to me, for then I shall have the

is miserably written, and I write it now, that I may for

ungrateful if your letters to me, and all I have heard of you,
had not strongly enhanced this feeling. But I did not feel in
the least sure that when you knew whither I was tending,
you might not think me so wild and foolish in my views (God
knows, arrived at slowly enough, and I hope conscientiously),
that you would think me worth no more notice or assistance.
To give one example : the last time I saw my dear old friend
Falconer, he attacked me most vigorously, but quite kindly,
and told me, You will do more harm than any ten Naturalists
will do good. I can see that you have already corrupted and
half-spoiled Hooker 1 !  Now when I see such strong feeling
in my oldest friends, you need not wonder that I always ex-
pect my views to be received with contempt But enough and
too much of thi.s.
I thank you most truly for the kind spirit of your last letter.
I agree to every word in it, and think I go as far as almost
any one in seeing the grave difficulties against my doctrine.
With respect to the extent to which I go, all the arguments
in favour of my notions fall rapidly away, the greater the scope
of forms considered. But in animals, embryology leads me to
an enormous and frightful range. The facts which kept me
longest scientifically orthodox are those of adaptation  the
pollen-masses in asclcpias  the mistletoe, with its pollen
carried by insects, and seed by birds  the woodpecker, with
its feet and tail, beak and tongue, to climb the tree and secure
insects. To talk of climate or Lamarckian habit producing
such adaptations to other organic beings is futile. This diffi-
culty I believe I have surmounted. As you seem interested
in the subject, and as it is an immense advantage to me to
write to you and to hear, ever so briefly, what you think,
I will enclose (copied, so as to save you trouble in reading)
the briefest abstract of my notions on the means by which
Nature makes her species. Why I think that species have
really changed, depends on general facts in the affinities,
embryology, rudimentary organs, geological history, and geo-

graphical distribution of organic beings. In regard to my
Abstract, you must take immensely on trust, each paragraph
occupying one or two chapters in my book. You will,
perhaps, think it paltry in me, when I ask you not to mention
my doctrine ; the reason is, if any one, like the author of the
 Vestiges, were to hear of them, he might easily work them
in, and then I should have to quote from a work perhaps
despised by naturalists, and this would greatly injure any
chance of my views being received by those alone whose
opinions I value. [Here follows a discussion on large
genera varying, which has no direct connection with the
remainder of the letter.]
I. It is wonderful what the principle of Selection by Man,
that is the picking out of individuals with any desired quality,
and breeding from them, and again picking out, can do.
Even breeders have been astonished at their own results.
They can act on differences inappreciable to an uneducated
eye. Selection has been metlwdically followed in Europe for
only the last half century. But it has occasionally, and even
in some degree methodically, been followed in the most
ancient times. There must have been also a kind of uncon-
scious selection from the most ancient times, namely, in the
preservation of the individual animals (without any thought of
their offspring) most useful to each race of man in his par-
ticular circumstances. The  roguing, as nursery-men call the
destroying of varieties, which depart from their type, is a kind
of selection. I am convinced that intentional and occasional
selection has been the main agent in making our domestic
races. But, however this may be, its great power of modifi-
cation has been indisputably shown in late times. Selection
acts only by the accumulation of very slight or greater
variations, caused by external conditions, or by the mere
fact that in generation the child is not absolutely similar to
its parent. Man, by this power of accumulating variations,
adapts living beings to his wants  he may be said to make

the wool of one sheep good for carpets, and another for
cloth, &c.
II. Now, suppose there was a being, who did not judge by-
mere external appearance, but could study the whole internal
organisation  who never was capricious  who should go on
selecting for one end during millions of generations, who will
say what he might not effect 1 In nature we have some slight
variations, occasionally in all parts ; and I think it can be
shown that a change in the conditions of existence is the
main cause of the child not exactly resembling its parents ;
and in nature, geology shows us what changes have taken
place, and are taking place. We have almost unlimited time ;
no one but a practical geologist can fully appreciate this :
think of the Glacial period, during the whole of which the
same species of shells at least have existed ; there must
have been during this period, millions on millions of
generations.
III. I think it can be shown that there is such an unerring
power at work, or Natural Selection (the title of my book),
which selects exclusively for the good of each organic being.
The elder De Candolle, W. Herbert, and Lyell, have written
strongly on the struggle for life; but even they have not
written strongly enough. Reflect that every being (even the
elephant) breeds at such a rate that, in a few years, or at most
a few centuries or thousands of years, the surface of the earth
would not hold the progeny of any one species. I have found
it hard constantly to bear in mind that the increase of every
single species is checked during some part of its life, or during
some shortly recurrent generation. Only a few of those
annually born can live to propagate their kind. What a
trifling difference must often determine which shall survive
and which perish 1
IV. Now take the case of a country undergoing some
change ; this will tend to cause some of its inhabitants to vary
slightly ; not but what I believe most beings vary at all times
124 the writing of the origin of species. [1858.
enough for selection to act on. Some of its inhabitants will
be exterminated, and the remainder will be exposed to the
mutual action of a different set of inhabitants, which I believe
to be more important to the life of each being than mere
climate. Considering the infinitely various ways beings have
to obtain food by struggling with other beings, to escape
danger at various times of life, to have their eggs or seeds
disseminated, &c. &c., I cannot doubt that during millions of
generations individuals of a species will be born with some
slight variation profitable to some part of its economy ; such
will have a better chance of surviving, propagating this varia-
tion, which again will be slowly increased by the accumulative
action of natural selection ; and the variety thus formed will
either coexist with, or more commonly will exterminate its
parent form. An organic being like the woodpecker, or
the mistletoe, may thus come to be adapted to a score of
contingencies ; natural selection, accumulating those slight
variations in all parts of its structure which are in any way
useful to it, during any part of its life.
V. Multiform difficulties will occur to every one on this
theory. Most can, I think, be satisfactorily answered.
Natura non facit saltum  answer some of the most obvi-
ous. The slowness of the change, and only a very few under-
going change at any one time answers others. The extreme
imperfections of our geological records answer others.
VI. One other principle, which maybe called the principle
of divergence, plays, I believe, an important part in the origin
of species. The same spot will support more life if occupied
by very diverse forms : we see this in the many generic forms
in a square yard of turf (I have counted twenty species
belonging to eighteen genera), or in the plants and insects,
on any little uniform islet, belonging to almost as many
genera and families as to species. We can understand this
with the higher animals, whose habits we best understand.
We know that it has been experimentally shown that a plot
1858.] THE LETTER TO DR. GRAY. 12$
of land will yield a greater weight, if cropped with several
species of grasses, than with two or three species. Now every
single organic being, by propagating rapidly, may be said to
be striving its utmost to increase in numbers. So it will be
with the offspring of any species after it has broken into
varieties, or sub-species, or true species. And it follows, I
think, from the foregoing facts, that the varying offspring of
each species will try (only few will succeed) to seize on as
many and as diverse places in the economy of nature as
possible. Each new variety or species when formed will
generally take the place of, and so exterminate its less well-
fitted parent This, I believe, to be the origin of the classifi-
cation or arrangement of all organic beings at all times.
These always seem to branch and sub-branch like a tree
from a common trunk ; the flourishing twigs destroying the
less vigorous  the dead and lost branches rudely representing
extinct genera and families.
This sketch is most imperfect ; but in so short a space I
cannot make it better. Your imagination must fill up many
wide blanks. Without some reflection, it will appear all
rubbish ; perhaps it will appear so after reflection.
C. Darwin.
P.S.  This little abstract touches only the accumulative
power of natural selection, which I look at as by far the most
important element in the production of new forms. The laws
governing the incipient or primordial variation (unimportant
except as the groundwork for selection to act on, in which
respect it is all important), I shall discuss under several
heads, but I can come, as you may well believe, only to very
partial and imperfect conclusions.
[The joint paper of Mr. Wallace and my father was read at
the Linnean Society on the evening of July ist Sir Charles
Lyell and Sir J. D. Hooker were present, and both, I believe,
made a few remarks, chiefly with a view of impressing on those

present the necessity of giving the most careful consideration
to what they had heard. There was, however, no semblance
of a discussion. Sir Joseph Hooker writes to me: The
interest excited was intense, but the subject was too novel
and too ominous for the old school to enter the lists, before
armouring. After the meeting it was talked over with bated
breath : Lyells approval, and perhaps in a small way mine,
as his lieutenant in the affair, rather overawed the Fellows,
who would otherwise have flown out against the doctrine.
We had, too, the vantage ground of being familiar with the
authors and their theme.]
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to J. D. Hooker.
Down, July 5th [1858].
My dear Hooker,  ^We are become more happy and
less panic-struck, now that we have sent out of the house
every child, and shall remove H., as soon as she can move.
The first nurse became ill with ulcerated throat and quinsy,
and the second is now ill with the scarlet fever, but, thank
God, is recovering. You may imagine how frightened we
have been. It has been a most miserable fortnight. Thank-
you much for your note, telling me that all had gone on
prosperously at the Linnean Society. You must let me once
again tell you how deeply I feel your generous kindness and
Lyells on this occasion. But in truth it shames me that
you should have lost time on a mere point of priority. I
shall be curious to see the proofs. I do not in the least
understand whether my letter to A. Gray is to be printed ;
I suppose not, only your note ; but I am quite indifferent,
and place myself absolutely in your and Lyells hands.
1 can easily prepare an abstract of my whole work, but I
can hardly see how it can be made scientific for a Journal,
without giving facts, which would be impossible. Indeed, a
mere abstract cannot be very short Could you give mo any

idea how many pages of the Journal could probably bo spared
Directly after my return home, I would begin and cut my
cloth to my measure. If the Referees were to reject it as not
strictly scientific, I could, perhaps, publish it as a pamphlet.
With respect to my big interleaved abstract,* would you
send it any time before you leave England, to the enclosed
address? If you do not go till August yth-ioth, I should
prefer it left with you. I hope you have jotted criticisms on
my MS. on big Genera, &c., sufficient to make you remember
your remarks, as I should be infinitely sorry to lose them.
And I see no chance of our meeting if you go soon abroad.
We thank you heartily for your invitation to join you : I can
fancy nothing which I should enjoy more ; but our children
are too delicate for us to leave; I should be mere living
lumber.
Lastly, you said you would write to Wallace ; I certainly
should much like this, as it would quite exonerate me : if you
would send me your note, sealed up, I would fonvard it with
my own, as I know the address, &c.
Will you answer me some time about your notions of the
length of my abstract.
If you see Lyell, will you tell him how truly grateful I feel
for his kind interest in this affair of mine. You must know that
I look at it, as very important, for the reception of the view
of species not being immutable, the fact of the greatest
Geologist and Botanist in England taking any sort of interest
in the subject: I am sure it will do much to break down
prejudices.

C. Darwin.

My dear Hooker,  ^Your letter to Wallace seems to me
perfect, quite clear and most courteous. I do not think it
could possibly be improved, and I have to-day forwarded it
with a letter of my own. I always thought it very possible
that I might be forestalled, but I fancied that I had a grand
enough soul not to care ; but I found myself mistaken and
punished ; I had, however, quite resigned myself, and had
written half a letter to Wallace to give up all priority to him,
and should certainly not have changed had it not been for
Lyells and your quite extraordinary kindness. I assure you
I feel it, and shall not forget it I am more than satisfied at
what took place at the Linnean Society. 1 had thought
that your letter and mine to Asa Gray were to be only an
appendix to Wallaces paper.
We go from here in a few days to the sea-side, probably
to the Isle of Wight, and on my return (after a battle with
pigeon skeletons) I will set to work at the abstract, though
how on earth I shall make anything of an abstract in thirty
pages of the Journal, I know not, but will try my best. I shall
order Bentham ; is it not a pity that you should waste time
in tabulating varieties ? for I can get the Down schoolmaster
to do it on my return, and can tell you all the results.
I must try and see you before your journey ; but do not
think I am fishing to ask you to come to Down, for you will
have no time for that.
You cannot imagine how pleased I am that the notion of
Natural Selection has acted as a purgative on your bowels of
immutability. Whenever naturalists can look at species
changing as certain, what a magnificent field will be open,
on all the laws of variation,  on the genealogy of all living
beings,  on their lines of migration, &c. &c. Pray thank

I am disgusted with my bad writing. I could not improve
it, without rewriting all, which would not be fair or worth
while, as I have begun on a better abstract for the Linnean
Society. My excuse is that it never was intended for publica-
tion. I have made only a few corrections in the style ; but I
cannot make it decent, but I hope moderately intelligible. I
suppose some one will correct the revise. (Shall I ?)
Could I have a clean proof to send to Wallace ?
I have not yet fully considered your remarks on big genera
(but your general concurrence is of the highest possible interest
to me) ; nor shall I be able till I re-read my MS. ; but you
may rely on it that you never make a remark to me which is

my specuiations were a "jam-pot" to you ; indeed, I thought,
untii quite iateiy, that my MS. had produced no effect on
you, and this has often staggered me. Nor did I know that
you had spoken in generai terms about my work to our
friends, excepting to dear oid Faiconer, who some few years
ago once told me that I should do more mischief than any ten
other naturalists would do good, [and] that I had half-spoiled
you already ! All this is stupid egotistical stuff, and I write
it only because you may think me ungrateful for not having
valued and understood your sympathy ; which God knows is
not the case. It is an accursed evil to a man to become so
absorbed in any subject as I am in mine.
I was in London yesterday for a few hours with Falconer,
and he gave me a magnificent lecture on the age of man. We
arc not upstarts ; we can boast of a pedigree going far back
in time coeval with extinct species. He has a grand fact of
some large molar tooth in the Trias.
I am quite knocked up, and am going next Monday to
revive under Water-cure at Moor Park.
My dear Hooker, yours affectionately,

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to J. D. Hooker.
Down, Jan. 20th, 1859.
My dear Hooker,  I should very much like to borrow
Heer at some future time, for I want to read nothing per-
plexing at present till my Abstract is done. Your last very
instructive letter shall make me very cautious on the hyper-
speculative points we have been discussing.
When you say you cannot master the train of thoughts,
I know well enough that they are too doubtful and obscure to
be mastered. I have often experienced what you call the
humiliating feeling of getting more and more involved in
doubt, the more one thinks of the facts and reasoning on
doubtful points. But I always comfort myself with thinking
of the future, and in the full belief that the problems which we
are just entering on, will some day be solved ; and if we just
break the ground we shall have done some service, even if we
reap no harvest
I quite agree that we only differ in degree about the means
of dispersal, and that I think a satisfactory amount of accord-
ance. You put in a very striking manner the mutation of our
continents, and I quite agree ; I doubt only about our oceans.
I also agree (I am in a very agreeing frame of mind) with
your argumentum ad hominem, about the highness of the
Australian Flora from the number of species and genera ; but
here comes in a superlative bothering element of doubt, viz.
the effects of isolation.
The only point in which I presumptuously rather demur
is about the status of the naturalised plants in Australia. 1
think Muller speaks of their having spread largely beyond
cultivated ground ; and I can hardly believe that our Euro-
pean plants would occupy stations so barren that the native
plants could not live there. I should require much evidence
to make me believe this. I have written this note merely to
thank you, as you will see it requires no answer.

Please return that to me, and Lyell ought to be told how

My dear Sir,  I was extremely much pleased at receiving
three days ago your letter to me and that to Dr. Hooker.
Permit me to say how heartily I admire the spirit in which
they are written. Though I had absolutely nothing whatever
to do in leading Lyell and Hooker to what they thought a
fair course of action, yet I naturally could not but feel anxious
to hear what your impression would be. I owe indirectly
much to you and them ; for I almost think that Lyell would
have proved right, and I should never have completed my
larger work, for I have found my Abstract hard enough with
ray poor health, but now, thank God, I am in my last chapter
but one. My Abstract will make a small volume of 400 or
500 pages. Whenever published, I will, of course, send you a
copy, and then you will see what I mean about the part
which I believe selection has played with domestic produc-

tions. It is a very different part, as you suppose, from that
played by  Natural Selection. I sent off by the same address
as this note, a copy of the Journal of the Linnean Society,
and subsequently I have sent some half-dozen copies of the
paper. I have many other copies at your disposal. . . .
I am glad to hear that you have been attending to birds
nests. I have done so, though almost exclusively under one
point of view, viz. to show that instincts vary, so that selec-
tion could work on and improve them. Few other instincts,
so to speak, can be preserved in a Museum.
Many thanks for your offer to look after horses stripes ; if
there are any donkeys, pray add them. I am delighted
to hear that you have collected bees combs This is
an especial hobby of mine, and I think I can throw a light
on the subject If you can collect duplicates, at no very
great expense, I should be glad of some specimens for myself
with some bees of each kind. Young, growing, and irregular
combs, and those which have not had pupae, are most valuable
for measurements and examination. Their edges should be
well protected against abrasion.
Every one whom I have seen has thought your paper very
well written and interesting. It puts my extracts (written in
1839, now just twenty years ago !), which I must say in apo-
logy were never for an instant intended for publication, into
the shade.
You cisk about Lyells frame of mind. I think he is some-
what staggered, but does not give in, and speaks with horror,
often to me, of what a thing it would be, and what a job it
would be for the next edition of  The Principles, if he were
" perverted. But he is most candid and honest, and I think
will end by being perverted. Dr. Hooker has become almost
as heterodox as you or I, and I look at Hooker as by far the
most capable judge in Europe.
Most cordially do I wish you health and entire success in
all your pursuits, and, God knows, if admirable zeal and
energy deserve success, most amply do you deserve it I look

But my two chapters on this subject are in type, and, though

that I am fully resolved not to add one word, and merely
improve the style. So you will see that my views are nearly

word shall be altered owing to my having read your ideas.
Are you aware that Mr. W. Earl * [��c] published several years
ago the view of distribution of animals in the Malay Archi-

I was much struck with this, and have been in the habit of
noting all facts in distribution in that archipelago, and else-
where, in this relation. I have been led to conclude that
there has been a good deal of naturalisation in the different
Malay islands, and which I have thought, to a certain extent,
would account for anomalies. Timor has been my greatest
puzzle. What do you say to the peculiar Felis there? I
wish that you had visited Timor ; it has been asserted that a
fossil mastodons or elephants tooth (I forget which) has been
found there, which would be a grand fact I was aware that
Celebes was very peculiar ; but the relation to Africa is quite
new to mo, and marvellous, and almost passes belief. It is as-
anomaious as the relation of filan/s in S.W. Australia to the.
Cape of Good Hope. I differ wholly from you on the colonisa-
tion of oceanic islands, but you will have every one else
on your side. I quite agree with respect to all islands not
situated far in the ocean. I quite agree on the little occa-
sional intermigration between lands [islands?] when once
pretty well stocked with inhabitants, but think this does not
apply to rising and ill-stocked islands. Are you aware that
annually birds are blown to Madeira, the Azores (and to
Bermuda from America) ? I wish I had given a fuller abstract

CHAPTER V.
BY PROFESSOR HUXLEY.
ON THE RECEPTION OF THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES.
To the present generation, that is to say, the people a few
years on the hither and thither side of thirty, the name of
Charles Darwin stands alongside of those of Isaac Newton and
Michael Faraday ; and, like them, calls up the grand ideal of
a searcher after truth and interpreter of Nature. They think
of him who bore it as a rare combination of genius, industry,
and unswerving veracity, who earned his place among the
most famous men of the age by sheer native power, in the
teeth of a gale of popular prejudice, and uncheered by a
sign of favour or appreciation from the official fountains of
honour ; as one who, in spite of an acute sensitiveness to
praise and blame, and notwithstanding provocations which
might have excused any outbreak, kept himself clear of all
envy, hatred, and malice, nor dealt otherwise than fairly and
justly with the unfairness and injustice which was showered
upon him ; while, to the end of his days, he was ready to
listen with patience and respect to the most insignificant of
reasonable objectors.
And with respect to that theory of the origin of the forms of
life peopling our globe, with which Dan,vins name is bound up
as closely as that of Newton with the theory of gravitation,
nothing seems to be further from the mind of the present
generation than any attempt to smother it with ridicule or
to crush it by vehemence of denunciation.  The struggle for
N 2
ON THE RECEPTION OF
existence," and " Natural selection, have become household
words and every-day conceptions. The reality and the im-
portance of the natural processes on which Darwin founds
his deductions are no more doubted than those of growth
and multiplication ; and, whether the full potency attributed
to them is admitted or not, no one doubts their vast and far-
reaching significance. Wherever the biological sciences are
studied, the  Origin of Species  lights the path of the in-
vestigator ; wherever they are taught it permeates the course
of instruction. Nor has the influence of Darwinian ideas
been less profound, beyond the realms of Biology. The
oldest of all philosophies, that of Evolution, was bound hand
and foot and cast into utter darkness during the millennium
of theological scholasticism. But Darwin poured new life-
blood into the ancient frame ; the bonds burst, and the
revivified thought of ancient Greece has proved itself to be
a more adequate expression of the universal order of things
than any of the schemes which have been accepted by the
credulity and welcomed by the superstition of seventy later
generations of men.
To any one who studies the signs of the times, the
emergence of the philosophy of Evolution, in the attitude of
claimant to the throne of the world of thought, from the
limbo of hated and, as many hoped, forgotten things, is the
most portentous event of the nineteenth century. But the
most effective weapons of the modem champions of Evolution
were fabricated by Darwin ; and the  Origin of Species ' has
enlisted a formidable body of combatants, trained in the se-
vere school of Physical Science, whose ears might have long
remained deaf to the speculations of a priori philosophers.
I do not think that any candid or instructed person will
deny the truth of that which has just been asserted. He may
hate the very name of Evolution, and may deny its pretensions
as vehemently as a Jacobite denied those of George the Second.
But there it is  not only as solidly seated as the Hanoverian
 ORIGIN OF SPECIES.
l8l
dynasty, but happily independent of Parliamentary sanction
and the dullest antagonists have come to see that they have
to deal with an adversary whose bones are to be broken by
no amount of bad words.
Even the theologians have almost ceased to pit the plain
meaning of Genesis against the no less plain meaning of
Nature. Their more candid, or more cautious, representatives
have given up dealing with Evolution as if it were a damnable
heresy, and have taken refuge in one of two courses. Either
they deny that Genesis was meant to teach scientific truth,
and thus save the veracity of the record at the expense of its
authority ; or they expend their energies in devising the cruel
ingenuities of the reconciler, and torture texts in the vain
hope of making them confess the creed of Science. But when
the peine forte et dure is over, the antique sincerity of the vener-
able sufferer always reasserts itself. Genesis is honest to the
core, and professes to be no more than it is, a repository of
venerable traditions of unknown origin, claiming no scientific
authority and possessing none.
As my pen finishes these passages, I can but be
amused to think what a terrible hubbub would have been
made (in truth was made) about any similar expressions of
opinion a quarter of a century ago. In fact, the contrast
between the present condition of public opinion upon the
Darwinian question ; between the estimation in which
Darwins views are now held in the scientific world ; between
the acquiescence, or at least quiescence, of the theologians of
the self-respecting order at the present day and the out-
burst of antagonism on all sides in 1858-9, when the new
theory respecting the origin of species first became known to
the older generation to which I belong, is so startling that,
except for documentary evidence, I should be sometimes
inclined to think my memories dreams. I have a great
respect for the younger generation myself (they can write our
lives, and ravel out all our follies, if they choose to take the

trouble, by and by), and I should be glad to be assured that
the feeling is reciprocal ; but I am afraid that the story of our
dealings with Darwin may prove a great hindrance to that
veneration for our wisdom which 1 should like them to dis-
play. We have not even the excuse that, thirty years ago,
Mr. Danvin was an obscure novice, who had no claims on our
attention. On the contrary, his remarkable zoological and
geological investigations had long given him an assured posi-
tion among the most eminent and original investigators of
the day ; while his charming  Voyage of a Naturalist  had
justly earned him a wide-spread reputation among the general
public. I doubt if there was any man then living who had a
better right to expect that anything he might choose to say
on such a question as the Origin of Species would be listened
to with profound attention, and discussed w'ith respect ; and
there was certainly no man whose personal character should
have afforded a better safeguard against attacks, instinct with
malignity and spiced with shameless impertinences.
Yet such was the portion of one of the kindest and truest
men that it was ever my good fortune to know ; and years
had to pass away before misrepresentation, ridicule, and
denunciation, ceased to be the most notable constituents of
the majority of the multitudinous criticisms of his work which
poured from the press. I am loth to rake any of these ancient
scandals from their well-deserved oblivion ; but I must make
good a statement which may seem overcharged to the present
generation, and there is no pike justificative more apt for the
purpose, or more worthy of such dishonour, than the articie in
the  Quarterly Review  for July i860." Since Lord Brougham
THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES. 1 83
assailed Dr. Young, the world has seen no such specimen of
the insolence of a shallow pretender to a Master in Science as
this remarkable production, in which one of the most exact
of observers, most cautious of rcasoners, and most candid of
expositors, of this or any other age, is held up to scorn
as a  flighty " person, who endeavours  to prop up his utterly
rotten fabric of guess and speculation, and whose  mode of
dealing with nature  is reprobated as  utterly dishonourable
to Natural Science. And all this high and mighty talk, which
would have been indecent in one of Mr. Darwins equals,
proceeds from a writer whose want of intelligence, or of con-
science, or of both, is so great, that, by way of an objection to
Mr. Darwins views, he can ask,  Is it credible that all favour-
able varieties of turnips are tending to become men ;  who is
so ignorant of paleontology, that he can talk of the  flowers
and fruits  of the plants of the carboniferous epoch ; of com-
parative anatomy, that he can gravely affirm the poison appa-
ratus of the venomous snakes to be  entirely separate from
the ordinary laws of animal life, and peculiar to themselves
of the rudiments of physiology, that he can ask,  what
advantage of life could alter the shape of the corpuscles into
which the blood can be evaporated ?  Nor does the reviewer
fail to flavour this outpouring of preposterous incapacity with
a little stimulation of the odium tlmlogicum. Some inkling
of the history of the conflicts between Astronomy, Geology,
and Theology, leads him to keep a retreat open by the
proviso that he cannot consent to test the truth of Natural
Science by the word of Revelation ;  but, for all that, he
devotes pages to the exposition of his conviction that Mr.
Darwins theory contradicts the revealed relation of the
creation to its Creator, and is  inconsistent with the fulness
of his glory.
If I confine my retrospect of the reception of the  Origin
of Species  to a twelvemonth, or thereabouts, from the time
of its publication, I do not recollect anything quite so foolish
and unmannerly as the Quarterly Review article, unless,
perhaps, the address of a Reverend Professor to the Dublin
Geological Society might enter into competition with it But
a large proportion of Mr. Darwins critics had a lamentable
resemblance to the Quarterly reviewer, in so far as they
lacked either the will, or the wit, to make themselves masters
of his doctrine ; hardly any possessed the knowledge required
to follow him through the immense range of biological and
geological science which the  Origin  covered ; while, too
commonly, they had prejudged the case on theological
grounds, and, as seems to be inevitable when this happens,
eked out lack of reason by superfluity of railing.
But it will be more pleasant and more profitable to consider
those criticisms, which were acknowledged by writers of
scientific authority, or which bore internal evidence of the
greater or less competency and, often, of the good faith, of
their authors. Restricting my survey to a twelvemonth, or
thereabouts, after the publication of the  Origin, I find
among such critics Louis Agassiz;* Murray, an excellent
entomologist ; Harvey, a botanist of considerable repute ;
and the author of an article in the * Edinburgh Review, all
strongly adverse to Darwin. Pictet, the distinguished and
widely learned paleontologist of Geneva, treats Mr. Darwin
with a respect which forms a grateful contrast to the tone of
THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES.
(85
only a very little way.* On the other hand, Lyell, up to
that time a pillar of the anti-transmutationists (who regarded
him, ever afterwards, as Pallas Athene may have looked
at Dian, after the Endymion affair), declared himself a
Danvinian, though not without putting in a serious caveat.
Nevertheless, he was a tower of strength, and his courageous
stand for truth as against consistency, did him infinite
honour. As evolutionists, sans phrase, I do not call to mind
among the biologists more than Asa Gray, who fought the
battle splendidly in the United States ; Hooker, who was no
less vigorous here ; the present Sir John Lubbock and my-
self. Wallace was far away in the Malay Archipelago ; but,
apart' from his direct share in the promulgation of the
theory of natural selection, no enumeration of the influences
at work, at the time I am speaking of, would be com-
plete without the mention of his powerful essay  On the
Law which has regulated the Introduction of New Species,'
which was published in 1855. On reading it afresh, I have
been astonished to recollect how small was the impression
it made.
In France, the influence of Elie dc Beaumont and of Flourens,
 the former of whom is said to have  damned himself to
everlasting fame  by inventing the nickname of  la science
moussante" for Evolutionism,t  to say nothing of the ill-will
of other powerful members of the Institut, produced for a
  I see no serious objections to
the formation of varieties by natural
selection in the existing world, and
that, so far as earlier epochs are con-
cerned, this law may be assumed
to explain the origin of closely allied
species, supposing for this purpose a
very long period of time.
 With regard to simple varieties
and closely allied species, I believe
that Mr. Darwins theory may
explain many things, and throw a
great light upon numerous ques-

long time the effect of a conspiracy of silence ; and many
years passed before the Academy redeemed itself from the
reproach that the name of Darwin was not to be found on the
list of its members. However, an accomplished writer, out of
the range of academical influences, M. Laugel, gave an excel-
lent and appreciative notice of the Origin in the Revue
des Deux Mondes. Germany took time to consider ; Bronn
produced a slightly Bowdlerized translation of the  Origin  ;
and  Kladderadatsch  cut his jokes upon the ape origin of
man ; but I do not call to mind that any scientific notability
declared himself publicly in i86o.* None of us dreamed that,
in the course of a few years, the strength (and perhaps I may add
the weakness) of  Darwinismus  would have its most exten-
sive and most brilliant illustrations in the land of learning.
If a foreigner may presume to speculate on the cause of this
curious interval of silence, I fancy it was that one moiety of
the German biologists were orthodox at any price, and the
other moiety as distinctly heterodox. The latter were evo-
lutionists, a priori, already, and they must have felt the dis-
gust natural to deductive philosophers at being offered an
inductive and experimental foundation for a conviction which
they had reached by a shorter cut It is undoubtedly trying
to learn that, though your conclusions may be all right your
reasons for them are all wrong, or, at any rate, insufficient
On the whole, then, the supporters of Mr. Darwins views
in 1 860 were numerically extremely insignificant. There is not
the slightest doubt that, if a general council of the Church
scientific had been held at that time, we should have been con-
demned by an overwhelming majority. And there is as little
doubt that if such a council gathered now, the decree would
be of an exactly contrary nature. It would indicate a lack

of sense, as well as of modesty, to ascribe to the men of that
generation less capacity or less honesty than their successors
possess. What, then, are the causes which led instructed and
fair-judging men of that day to arrive at a judgment so
different from that which seems just and fair to those who
follow them ? That is really one of the most interesting of all
questions connected with the history of science, and I shall
try to answer it. I am afraid that in order to do so I must
run the risk of appearing egotistical. However, if I tell my
own story it is only because I know it better than that of
other people.
I think I must have read the  Vestiges  before I left Eng-
land in 1846 ; but, if I did, the book made very little impres-
sion upon me, and I was not brought into serious contact with
the Species question until after 1850. At that time, I had
long done with the Pentateuchal cosmogony, which had been
impressed upon my childish understanding as Divine truth,
with all the authority of parents and instructors, and from
which it had cost me many a struggle to get free. But my
mind was unbiassed in respect of any doctrine which presented
itself, if it professed to be based on purely philosophical and
scientific reasoning. It seemed to me then (as it does now)
that  creation, in the ordinary sense of the word, is perfectly
conceivable. I find no difficulty in imagining that, at some
former period, this universe was not in existence ; and that
it made its appearance in six days (or instantaneously, if
that is preferred), in consequence of the volition of some pre-
existent Being. Then, as now, the so-called a priori argu-
ments against Theism, and, given a Deity, against the
possibility of creative acts, appeared to me to be devoid of
reasonable foundation. I had not then, and I have not now,
the smallest a priori objection to raise to the account of the
creation of animals and plants given in  Paradise Lost, in
which Milton so vividly embodies the natural sense of Genesis.
Far be it from me to say that it is untrue because it is impos-

sible. I confine myself to what must be regarded as a modest
and reasonable request for some particle of evidence that the
existing species of animals and plants did originate in that
way, as a condition of my belief in a statement which appears
to me to be highly improbable.
And, by way of being perfectly fair, I had exactly the
same answer to give to the evolutionists of 1851-8. Within
the ranks of the biologists, at that time, I met with nobody,
except Dr. Grant, of University College, who had a word to say
for Evolution  and his advocacy was not calculated to advance
the cause. Outside these ranks, the only person known to me
whose knowledge and capacity compelled respect, and who
was, at the same time, a thorough-going evolutionist, was Mr.
Herbert Spencer, whose acquaintance I made, I think, in
1852, and then entered into the bonds of a friendship which,
I am happy to think, has known no interruption. Many and
prolonged were the battles we fought on this topic. But
even my friends rare dialectic skill and copiousness of
apt illustration could not drive me from my agnostic position.
I took my stand upon two grounds : firstly, that up to that
time, the evidence in favour of transmutation was wholly
insufficient; and, secondly, that no suggestion respecting
the causes of the transmutation assumed, which had been
made, was in any way adequate to explain the phenomena.
Looking back at the state of knowledge at that time, I
really do not see that any other conclusion was justifiable.
In those days I had never even heard of Treviranus
 Biologic. However, I had studied Lamarck attentively and
I had read the  Vestiges  with due care ; but neither of them
afforded me any good ground for changing my negative
and critical attitude. As for the  Vestiges, I confess that
the book simply irritated me by the prodigious ignorance
and thoroughly unscientific habit of mind manifested by the
writer. If it had any influence on me at all, it set me
against Evolution ; and the only review I ever have qualms
THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES.
of conscience about, on the ground of needless savagery, is
one I wrote on the  Vestiges  while under that influence.
With respect to the Philosophie Zoologique, it is no
reproach to Lamarck to say that the discussion of the Species
question in that work, whatever might be said for it in 1809,
was miserably below the level of the knowledge of half a
century later. In that interval of time the elucidation of
the structure of the lower animals and plants had given rise
to wholly new conceptions of their relations ; histology and
embryology, in the modern sense, had been created ; physio-
logy had been reconstituted ; the facts of distribution,
geological and geographical, had been prodigiously multi-
plied and reduced to order. To any biologist whose studies
had carried him beyond mere species-mongering in 1850, one-
half of Lamarcks arguments were obsolete and the other
half erroneous, or defective, in virtue of omitting to deal with
the various classes of evidence which had been brought to
light since his time. Moreover his one suggestion as to the
cause of the gradual modifleation of species  effort excited
by change of conditions  was, on the face of it, inapplicable to
the whole vegetable world. I do not think that any impartial
judge who reads the  Philosophie Zoologique  now, and who
aftenvards takes up Lyells trenchant and effectual criticism
(published as far back as 1830), will be disposed to allot
to Lamarck a much higher place in the establishment of
biological evolution than that which Bacon assigns to himself
in relation to physical science generally ,  buccinator tautum.'
But, by a curious irony of fate, the same influence which
led me to put as little faith in modem speculations on this
subject, as in the venerable traditions recorded in the first two
chapters of Genesis, was perhaps more potent than any other

in keeping alive a sort of pious conviction that Evolution,
after all, would turn out true. I have recently read afresh
the first edition of the Principles of Geology ; and when I
consider that this remarkable book had been nearly thirty
years in everybodys hands, and that it brings home to any
reader of ordinary intelligence a great principle and a great
fact  the principle, that the past must be explained by the
present, unless good cause be shown to the contrary ; and the
fact, that, so far as our knowledge of the past history of life
on our globe goes, no such cause can be shown *  I cannot
but believe that Lycll, for others, as for myself, was the chief
agent in smoothing the road for Danvin. For consistent
uniformitarianism postulates evolution as much in the organic
as in the inorganic world. The origin of a new species by
other than ordinary agencies would be a vastly greater
 catastrophe  than any of those which Lyell successfully
eliminated from sober geological speculation.
In fact, no one was better aware of this than Lyell himselff
If one reads any of the earlier editions of the Principles
carefully (especially by the light of the interesting series of
letters recently published by Sir Charles Lyells biographer), it
is easy to sec that, with all his energetic opposition to Lamarck,

on the one hand, and to the ideal quasi-progressionism of
Agassiz, on the other, Lyell, in his own mind, was strongly-
disposed to account for the origination of all past and present
species of living things by natural causes. But he would have
liked, at the same time, to keep the name of creation for a
natural process which he imagined to be incomprehensible.
for CTTXTHR Lyell,* writing to Sir Charles Bunbury (under date of
April 30, 1856), says;
 When Huxley, Hooker, and Wollaston were at Darwins
last week they (all four of them) ran a tilt against species

1 recollect nothing of this beyond the fact of meeting Mr.
Wollaston ; and except for Sir Charles distinct assurance
as to " all four, I should have thought my outrecuidance was
probably a counterblast to Wollastons conservatism. With
regard to Hooker, he was already, like Voltaires Habakkuk,
"capable de tout" in the way of advocating Evolution.
As I have already said, I imagine that most of those of my
contemporaries who thought seriously about the matter, were

houses !  and disposed to turn aside from an interminable and
apparently fruitless discussion, to labour in the fertile fields
of ascertainable fact. And I may, therefore, further suppose
that the publication of the Darwin and Wallace papers in
1858, and still more that of the  Origin  in 1859, had tlie
effect upon them of the flash of light, which to a man who
has lost himself in a dark night, suddenly reveals a road
which, whether it takes him straight home or not, certainly
goes his way. That which we were looking for, and could
not find, was a hypothesis respecting the origin of known
oiganic forms, which assumed the operation of no causes but
such as could be proved to be actually at work. We wanted,
not to pin our faith to that or any other speculation, but to
get hold of clear and definite conceptions which could be
brought face to face with facts and have their validity tested.
The Origin provided us with the working hypothesis we
sought. Moreover, it did the immense service of freeing
us for ever from the dilemma  refuse to accept the creation
hypothesis, and what have you to propose that can be accepted
by any cautious reasoncr? In 1857, I had no answer ready,
and I do not think that any one else had. A year later, we
reproached ourselves with dulness for being perplexed by
.such an inquiry. My reflection, when I first made myself
master of the central idea of the  Origin, was,  How ex-
tremely stupid not to have thought of that ! " I suppose that
Columbus companions said much the same when he made
the egg stand on end. The facts of variability, of the struggle
for existence, of adaptation to conditions, were notorious
enough ; but none of us had suspected that the road to the
heart of the species problem lay through them, until Darwin
and Wallace dispelled the darkness, and the beacon-fire of
the  Origin  guided the benighted.
Whether the particular shape which the doctrine of evolu-
tion, as applied to the organic world, took in Darwins hands,
would prove to be final or not, was, to me, a matter of indifier-
ON THE RECEPTION OF

ence. In my earliest criticisms of the  Origin  I ventured to-
point out that its logical foundation was insecure so long as.
experiments in selective breeding had not produced varieties
which were more or less infertile ; and that insecurity remains
up to the present time. But, with any and every critical doubt
which my sceptical ingenuity could suggest, the Darwinian
hypothesis remained incomparably more probable than the
creation hypothesis. And if we had none of us been able ta
discern the paramount significance of some of the most patent
and notorious of natural facts, until they were, so to speak,
thrust under our noses, what force remained in the dilemma
creation or nothing? It was obvious that, hereafter, the
probability would be immensely greater, that the links of
natural causation were hidden from our purblind eyes, than
that natural causation should be incompetent to produce ail
the phenomena of nature. The only rational course for those
who had no other object than the attainment of truth, was to
accept  Darwinism  as a working hypothesis, and see what
could be made of it Either it would prove its capacity to
elucidate the facts of organic life, or it would break down under
the strain. This was surely the dictate of common sense
and, for once, common sense carried the day. The result has
been that complete volte-face of the whole scientific world,
which must seem so surprising to the present generation. I
do not mean to say that all the leaders of biological science
have avowed themselves Dar^vinians ; but I do not think
that there is a single zoologist, or botanist, or palmontologist,
among the multitude of active workers of this generation,
who is other than an evolutionist, profoundly influenced by
Danvins views. Whatever may be the ultimate fate of the
particular theory put forth by Danvin, I venture to affirm that,,
so far as my knowledge goes, all the ingenuity and all the
learning of hostile critics has not enabled them to adduce a
solitary fact, of which it can be said, this is irreconcilable with
the Darwinian theory. In the prodigious variety and com-

plexity of organic nature, there arc multitudes of phenomena
which are not deduciblc from any generalisations we have yet
reached. But the same may be said of every other class of
natural objects. I believe that astronomers cannot yet get
the moons motions into perfect accordance with the theory
of gravitation.
It would be inappropriate, even if it were possible, to dis-
cuss the difficulties and unresolved problems which have
hitherto met the evolutionist, and which will probably continue
to puzzle him for many generations to come, in the course of
this brief history of the reception of Mr. Darwins great work.
But there are two or three objections of a more general
character, based, or supposed to be based, upon philosophical
and theological foundations, which were loudly expressed in
the early days of the Darwinian controversy, and which,
though they have been answered over and over again, crop
up now and then at the present day.
The most singular of these, perhaps immortal, fallacies,
which live bn, Tithonus-like, when sense and force have long
deserted them, is that which charges Mr. Darwin with having
attempted to reinstate the old pagan goddess. Chance. It is
said that he supposes variations to come about  by chance,
and that the fittest survive the  chances  of the struggle for
existence, and thus chance is substituted for providential
design.
It is not a little wonderful that such an accusation as this
should be brought against a writer who has, over and over
again, warned his readers that when he uses the word  spon-
taneous, he merely means that he is ignorant of the cause of
that which is so termed ; and whose whole theory crumbles
to pieces if the uniformity and regularity of natural causation
for illimitable past ages is denied. But prnbiiMy tlir lunl
answer to those who talk of Darwinism mciatlngltlic
 chance, is to ask them what they thems^veirfnderstand by

"chance. Do they believe that anything in this universe
happens without reason or without a cause ? Do they really
conceive that any event has no cause, and could not have
been predicted by any one who had a sufficient insight into
the order of Nature? If they do, it is they who are the
inheritors of antique superstition and ignorance, and whose
minds have never been illumined by a ray of scientific
thought The one act of faith in the convert to science, is
the confession of the universality of order and of the absolute
validity, in all times and under all circumstances, of the law
of causation. This confession is an act of faith, because,
by the nature of the case, the truth of such propositions is
not susceptible of proof. But such faith is not blind, but
reasonable ; because it is invariably confirmed by experi-
ence, and constitutes the sole trustworthy foundation for all
If one of these people, in whom the chance-worship of our
remoter ancestors thus strangely survives, should be within
reach of the sea when a heavy gale is blowing, let him betake
himself to the shore and watch the scene. Let him note the
infinite variety of form and size of the tossing waves out at
sea ; or of the curves of their foam-crested breakers, as they
dash against the rocks ; let him listen to the roar and scream
of the shingle as it is cast up and torn down the beach ; or
look at the flakes of foam as they drive hither and thither
before the wind ; or note the play of colours, which answers
a gleam of sunshine as it falls upon their myriad bubbles.
Surely here, if anywhere, he will say that chance is supreme,
and bend the knee as one who has entered the very penetralia
of his divinity. But the man of science knows that here, as
everywhere, perfect order is manifested ; that there is not a
curve of the waves, not a note in the howling chorus, not a
rainbow-glint on a bubble, which is other than a necessary
consequence of the ascertained laws of nature ; and that with
a sufficient knowledge of the conditions, competent physico-

mathematical skill could account for, and indeed predict,
every one of these  chance  events.
A second very common objection to Mr. Darwins views
was (and is), that they abolish Teleology, and eviscerate the
argument from design. It is nearly twenty years since I
ventured to offer some remarks on this subject, and as my
arguments have as yet received no refutation, 1 hope I may
be excused for reproducing them. I observed,  that the doc-
trine of Evolution is the most formidable opponent of all the
commoner and coarser forms of Teleology. But perhaps the
most remarkable service to the philosophy of Biology ren-
dered by Mr. Darwin is the reconciliation of Teleology and
Morphology, and the explanation of the facts of both, which
his views offer. The teleology which supposes that the eye,
such as we see it in man, or one of the higher vertebrata, was
made with the precise structure it exhibits, for the purpose of
enabling the animal which possesses it to see, has undoubtedly
received its death-blow. Nevertheless, it is necessary to re-
member that there is a wider teleology which is not touched
by the doctrine of Evolution, but is actually based upon the
fundamental proposition of Evolution. This proposition is
that the whole world, living and not living, is the result of the
mutual interaction, according to definite laws, of the forces
possessed by the molecules of which the primitive nebulosity
of the universe was composed. If this be true, it is no less
certain that the existing world lay potentially in the cosmic
vapour, and that a sufficient intelligence could, from a know-
ledge of the properties of the molecules of that vapour, have
predicted, say the state of the fauna of Britain in 1869, with
as much certainty as one can say what will happen to the
vapour of the breath on a cold winter's day. ....
.... The teleological and the mechanical views of nature
arc not, necessarily, mutually exclusive. On the contrary, the
more purely a mechanist the speculator is, the more firmly
 I should now like to substitute the word powers for  forces.

does he assume a primordial molecular arrangement of which
all the phenomena of the universe arc the consequences,,
and the more completely is he thereby at the mercy of the
telcologist, who can always defy him to disprove that this
primordial molecular arrangement was not intended to evolve
the phenomena of the universe.
The acute champion of Teleology, Paley, saw no difficulty
in admitting that the production of things may be the
result of trains of mechanical dispositions fixed beforehand
by intelligent appointment and kept in action by a power at
the centre, t that is to say, he proleptically accepted the modem
doctrine of Evolution ; and his successors might do well to
follow their leader, or at any rate to attend to his weighty
reasonings, before rushing into an antagonism which has no
reasonable foundation.
Having got rid of the belief in chance and the disbelief in
design, as in no sense appurtenances of Evolution, tire third
libel upon that doctrine, that it is anti-theistic, might perhaps
be left to shift for itself. But the persistence with which
many people refuse to draw the plainest consequences from
the propositions they profess to accept, renders it advisable
to remark that the doctrine of Evolution is neither Anti-
theistic nor Theistic. It simply has no more to do with Theism
than the first book of Euclid has. It is quite certain that a
normal fresh-laid egg contains neither cock nor hen ; and it
is also as certain as any proposition in physics or morals, that
if such an egg is kept under proper conditions for three
weeks, a cock or hen chicken will be found in it It is also
quite certain that if the shell were transparent we should be
able to watch the formation of the young fowl, day by day,,
by a process of evolution, from a microscopic cellular germ
to its full size and complication of structure. Therefore

Evolution, in the strictest sense, is actually going on in this
and analogous millions and millions of instances, wherever
living creatures exist. Therefore, to borrow an argument
from Butler, as that which now happens must be consistent
with the attributes of the Deity, if such a Being exists.
Evolution must be consistent with those attributes. And, if
so, the evolution of the universe, which is neither more nor less
explicable than that of a chicken, must also be consistent
with them. The doctrine of Evolution, therefore, does not
even come into contact with Theism, considered as a philo-
sophical doctrine. That with which it does collide, and with
which it is absolutely inconsistent, is the conception of
creation, which theological speculators have based upon the
history narrated in the opening of the book of Genesis.
There is a greal deal of talk and not a little lamentation
about the so-called religious difHcuIties which physical science
has created. In theological science, as a matter of fact, it
has created none. Not a solitary problem presents itself to
the philosophical Theist, at the present day, which has not
existed from the time that philosophers began to think out
the logical grounds and the logical consequences of Theism.
All the real or imaginary perplexities which flow from the
conception of the universe as a determinate mechanism, are
equally involved in the assumption of an Eternal, Omnipotent
and Omniscient Deity. The theological equivalent of the
scientific conception of order is Providence ; and the doctrine
of determinism follows as surely from the attributes of fore-
knowledge assumed by the theologian, as from the universality
of natural causation assumed by the man of science. The
angels in * Paradise Lost  would have found the task of en-
lightening Adam upon the mysteries of  Fate, Foreknow-
ledge, and Free-will, not a whit more difficult, if their pupil
had been educated in a " Real-schule  and trained in every
laboratory of a modem university. In respect of the great
problems of Philosophy, the post-Darwinian generation is.

in one sense, exactly where the prae-Darwinian generations
were. They remain insoluble. But the present generation
has the advantage of being better provided with the means
of freeing itself from the tyranny of certain sham solutions.
The known is finite, the unknown infinite ; intellectually
we stand on an islet in the midst of an illimitable ocean
of inexplicability. Our business in every generation is to
reclaim a little more land, to add something to the extent
and the solidity of our possessions. And even a cursory
glance at the history of the biological sciences during the
last quarter of a century is sufficient to justify the assertion,
that the most potent instrument for the extension of the
realm of natural knowledge which has come into mens hands,
since the publication of Newtons Principia, is Danvin's
 Origin of Species.
It was badly received by the generation to which it was
first addressed, and the outpouring of angry nonsense to which
it gave rise is sad to think upon. But the present generation
will probably behave just as badly if another Danvin should
arise, and inflict upon them that which the generality of man-
kind most hate  the necessity of revising their convictions.
Let them, then, be charitable to us ancients ; and if they
behave no better than the men of my day to some new
benefactor, let them recollect that, after all, our wrath did not
come to much, and vented itself chiefly in the bad language
of sanctimonious scolds. Let them as speedily perform a
strategic right-about-face, and follow the truth wherever it
leads. The opponents of the new truth will discover, as those
of Darwin are doing, that, after all, theories do not alter facts,
and that the universe remains unaffected even though texts
crumble. Or, it may be, that, as history repeats itself, their
happy ingenuity will also discover that the new wine is
exactly of the same vintage as the old, and that (rightly
viewed) the old bottles prove to have been expressly made
for holding it.

that natural causation should be incompetent to produce ail
the phenomena of nature. The only rational course for those
who had no other object than the attainment of truth, was to
accept  Darwinism  as a working hypothesis, and see what
could be made of it Either it would prove its capacity to
elucidate the facts of organic life, or it would break down under
the strain. This was surely the dictate of common sense
and, for once, common sense carried the day. The result has
been that complete volte-face of the whole scientific world,
which must seem so surprising to the present generation. I
do not mean to say that all the leaders of biological science
have avowed themselves Dar^vinians ; but I do not think
that there is a single zoologist, or botanist, or palmontologist,
among the multitude of active workers of this generation,
who is other than an evolutionist, profoundly influenced by
Danvins views. Whatever may be the ultimate fate of the
particular theory put forth by Danvin, I venture to affirm that,,
so far as my knowledge goes, all the ingenuity and all the
learning of hostile critics has not enabled them to adduce a
solitary fact, of which it can be said, this is irreconcilable with
the Darwinian theory. In the prodigious variety and com-

plexity of organic nature, there arc multitudes of phenomena
which are not deduciblc from any generalisations we have yet
reached. But the same may be said of every other class of
natural objects. I believe that astronomers cannot yet get
the moons motions into perfect accordance with the theory
of gravitation.
It would be inappropriate, even if it were possible, to dis-
cuss the difficulties and unresolved problems which have
hitherto met the evolutionist, and which will probably continue
to puzzle him for many generations to come, in the course of
this brief history of the reception of Mr. Darwins great work.
But there are two or three objections of a more general
character, based, or supposed to be based, upon philosophical
and theological foundations, which were loudly expressed in
the early days of the Darwinian controversy, and which,
though they have been answered over and over again, crop
up now and then at the present day.
The most singular of these, perhaps immortal, fallacies,
which live bn, Tithonus-like, when sense and force have long
deserted them, is that which charges Mr. Darwin with having
attempted to reinstate the old pagan goddess. Chance. It is
said that he supposes variations to come about  by chance,
and that the fittest survive the  chances  of the struggle for
existence, and thus chance is substituted for providential
design.
It is not a little wonderful that such an accusation as this
should be brought against a writer who has, over and over
again, warned his readers that when he uses the word  spon-
taneous, he merely means that he is ignorant of the cause of
that which is so termed ; and whose whole theory crumbles
to pieces if the uniformity and regularity of natural causation
for illimitable past ages is denied. But prnbiiMy tlir lunl
answer to those who talk of Darwinism mciatlngltlic
 chance, is to ask them what they thems^veirfnderstand by

D^irr'C

"chance. Do they believe that anything in this universe
happens without reason or without a cause ? Do they really
conceive that any event has no cause, and could not have
been predicted by any one who had a sufficient insight into
the order of Nature? If they do, it is they who are the
inheritors of antique superstition and ignorance, and whose
minds have never been illumined by a ray of scientific
thought The one act of faith in the convert to science, is
the confession of the universality of order and of the absolute
validity, in all times and under all circumstances, of the law
of causation. This confession is an act of faith, because,
by the nature of the case, the truth of such propositions is
not susceptible of proof. But such faith is not blind, but
reasonable ; because it is invariably confirmed by experi-
ence, and constitutes the sole trustworthy foundation for all
If one of these people, in whom the chance-worship of our
remoter ancestors thus strangely survives, should be within
reach of the sea when a heavy gale is blowing, let him betake
himself to the shore and watch the scene. Let him note the
infinite variety of form and size of the tossing waves out at
sea ; or of the curves of their foam-crested breakers, as they
dash against the rocks ; let him listen to the roar and scream
of the shingle as it is cast up and torn down the beach ; or
look at the flakes of foam as they drive hither and thither
before the wind ; or note the play of colours, which answers
a gleam of sunshine as it falls upon their myriad bubbles.
Surely here, if anywhere, he will say that chance is supreme,
and bend the knee as one who has entered the very penetralia
of his divinity. But the man of science knows that here, as
everywhere, perfect order is manifested ; that there is not a
curve of the waves, not a note in the howling chorus, not a
rainbow-glint on a bubble, which is other than a necessary
consequence of the ascertained laws of nature ; and that with
a sufficient knowledge of the conditions, competent physico-

mathematical skill could account for, and indeed predict,
every one of these  chance  events.
A second very common objection to Mr. Darwins views
was (and is), that they abolish Teleology, and eviscerate the
argument from design. It is nearly twenty years since I
ventured to offer some remarks on this subject, and as my
arguments have as yet received no refutation, 1 hope I may
be excused for reproducing them. I observed,  that the doc-
trine of Evolution is the most formidable opponent of all the
commoner and coarser forms of Teleology. But perhaps the
most remarkable service to the philosophy of Biology ren-
dered by Mr. Darwin is the reconciliation of Teleology and
Morphology, and the explanation of the facts of both, which
his views offer. The teleology which supposes that the eye,
such as we see it in man, or one of the higher vertebrata, was
made with the precise structure it exhibits, for the purpose of
enabling the animal which possesses it to see, has undoubtedly
received its death-blow. Nevertheless, it is necessary to re-
member that there is a wider teleology which is not touched
by the doctrine of Evolution, but is actually based upon the
fundamental proposition of Evolution. This proposition is
that the whole world, living and not living, is the result of the
mutual interaction, according to definite laws, of the forces
possessed by the molecules of which the primitive nebulosity
of the universe was composed. If this be true, it is no less
certain that the existing world lay potentially in the cosmic
vapour, and that a sufficient intelligence could, from a know-
ledge of the properties of the molecules of that vapour, have
predicted, say the state of the fauna of Britain in 1869, with
as much certainty as one can say what will happen to the
vapour of the breath on a cold winter's day. ....
.... The teleological and the mechanical views of nature
arc not, necessarily, mutually exclusive. On the contrary, the
more purely a mechanist the speculator is, the more firmly
 I should now like to substitute the word powers for  forces.

202 ON THE RECEPTION OF
does he assume a primordial molecular arrangement of which
all the phenomena of the universe arc the consequences,,
and the more completely is he thereby at the mercy of the
telcologist, who can always defy him to disprove that this
primordial molecular arrangement was not intended to evolve
the phenomena of the universe.
The acute champion of Teleology, Paley, saw no difficulty
in admitting that the production of things may be the
result of trains of mechanical dispositions fixed beforehand
by intelligent appointment and kept in action by a power at
the centre, t that is to say, he proleptically accepted the modem
doctrine of Evolution ; and his successors might do well to
follow their leader, or at any rate to attend to his weighty
reasonings, before rushing into an antagonism which has no
reasonable foundation.
Having got rid of the belief in chance and the disbelief in
design, as in no sense appurtenances of Evolution, tire third
libel upon that doctrine, that it is anti-theistic, might perhaps
be left to shift for itself. But the persistence with which
many people refuse to draw the plainest consequences from
the propositions they profess to accept, renders it advisable
to remark that the doctrine of Evolution is neither Anti-
theistic nor Theistic. It simply has no more to do with Theism
than the first book of Euclid has. It is quite certain that a
normal fresh-laid egg contains neither cock nor hen ; and it
is also as certain as any proposition in physics or morals, that
if such an egg is kept under proper conditions for three
weeks, a cock or hen chicken will be found in it It is also
quite certain that if the shell were transparent we should be
able to watch the formation of the young fowl, day by day,,
by a process of evolution, from a microscopic cellular germ
to its full size and complication of structure. Therefore

Evolution, in the strictest sense, is actually going on in this
and analogous millions and millions of instances, wherever
living creatures exist. Therefore, to borrow an argument
from Butler, as that which now happens must be consistent
with the attributes of the Deity, if such a Being exists.
Evolution must be consistent with those attributes. And, if
so, the evolution of the universe, which is neither more nor less
explicable than that of a chicken, must also be consistent
with them. The doctrine of Evolution, therefore, does not
even come into contact with Theism, considered as a philo-
sophical doctrine. That with which it does collide, and with
which it is absolutely inconsistent, is the conception of
creation, which theological speculators have based upon the
history narrated in the opening of the book of Genesis.
There is a greal deal of talk and not a little lamentation
about the so-called religious difHcuIties which physical science
has created. In theological science, as a matter of fact, it
has created none. Not a solitary problem presents itself to
the philosophical Theist, at the present day, which has not
existed from the time that philosophers began to think out
the logical grounds and the logical consequences of Theism.
All the real or imaginary perplexities which flow from the
conception of the universe as a determinate mechanism, are
equally involved in the assumption of an Eternal, Omnipotent
and Omniscient Deity. The theological equivalent of the
scientific conception of order is Providence ; and the doctrine
of determinism follows as surely from the attributes of fore-
knowledge assumed by the theologian, as from the universality
of natural causation assumed by the man of science. The
angels in * Paradise Lost  would have found the task of en-
lightening Adam upon the mysteries of  Fate, Foreknow-
ledge, and Free-will, not a whit more difficult, if their pupil
had been educated in a " Real-schule  and trained in every
laboratory of a modem university. In respect of the great
problems of Philosophy, the post-Darwinian generation is.

in one sense, exactly where the prae-Darwinian generations
were. They remain insoluble. But the present generation
has the advantage of being better provided with the means
of freeing itself from the tyranny of certain sham solutions.
The known is finite, the unknown infinite ; intellectually
we stand on an islet in the midst of an illimitable ocean
of inexplicability. Our business in every generation is to
reclaim a little more land, to add something to the extent
and the solidity of our possessions. And even a cursory
glance at the history of the biological sciences during the
last quarter of a century is sufficient to justify the assertion,
that the most potent instrument for the extension of the
realm of natural knowledge which has come into mens hands,
since the publication of Newtons Principia, is Danvin's
 Origin of Species.
It was badly received by the generation to which it was
first addressed, and the outpouring of angry nonsense to which
it gave rise is sad to think upon. But the present generation
will probably behave just as badly if another Danvin should
arise, and inflict upon them that which the generality of man-
kind most hate  the necessity of revising their convictions.
Let them, then, be charitable to us ancients ; and if they
behave no better than the men of my day to some new
benefactor, let them recollect that, after all, our wrath did not
come to much, and vented itself chiefly in the bad language
of sanctimonious scolds. Let them as speedily perform a
strategic right-about-face, and follow the truth wherever it
leads. The opponents of the new truth will discover, as those
of Darwin are doing, that, after all, theories do not alter facts,
and that the universe remains unaffected even though texts
crumble. Or, it may be, that, as history repeats itself, their
happy ingenuity will also discover that the new wine is
exactly of the same vintage as the old, and that (rightly
viewed) the old bottles prove to have been expressly made
for holding it.

My dear Hooker,  I have just read a review on my
book in the Athenceum* and it excites my curiosity much
who is the author. If you should hear who writes in the
Athenteum I wish you would tell me. It seems to me well
done, but the reviewer gives no new objections, and, being
hostile, passes over every single argument in favour of the
doctrine, ... I fear from the tone of the review, that I have
written in a conceited and cocksure style,f which shames
me a little. There is another review of which I should like
to know the author, viz. of H. C. Watson in the Gardeners'
Chronicle. X Some of the remarks are like yours, and he does
deserve punishment ; but surely the review is too severe.

how big it is : I shall not be able to read it very soon. It
was very good of you to send Naudin, for I was very curious
to see it I am surprised that Decaisne should say it was
the same as mine. Naudin gives artificial selection, as well
as a score of English writers, and when he says species were
formed in the same manner, I thought the paper would cer-
tainly prove exactly the same as mine. But I cannot find
one word like the struggle for existence and natural selection.
On the contrary, he brings in his principle (p. 103) of finality
(which I do not understand), which, he says, with some authors
is fatality, with others providence, and which adapts the forms
of every being, and harmonises them all throughout nature.
He assumes like old geologists (who assumed that the forces
of nature were formerly greater), that species were at first
more plastic. His simile of tree and classification is like
mine (and others), but he cannot, I think, have reflected
much on the subject, otherwise he would see that genealogy
by itself does not give classification ; I declare I cannot see a
much closer approach to Wallace and me in Naudin than
in Lamarck  ^we all agree in modification and descent. If
I do not hear from you I will return the  Revue  in a few
days (with the cover). I dare say Lyell would be glad to see
it. By the way, I will retain the volume till I hear whether
I shall or not send it to Lyell. I should rather like Lyell
to see this note, though it is foolish work sticking up for
independence or priority.

My dear Carpenter,  I have just read your excellent
article in the  National. It will do great good ; especially if it
becomes known as your production. It seems to me to give
an excellently clear account of Mr. Wallaces and my views.
How capitally you turn the flanks of the theological opposers
by opposing to them such men as Bentham and the more
philosophical of the systematists ! I thank you sincerely for
the extremely honourable manner in which you mention me.
I should have liked to have seen some criticisms or remarks
on embryology, on which subject you are so well instructed.
I do not think any candid person can read your article with-
out being much impressed with it. The old doctrine of
immutability of specific forms will surely but slowly die away.
It is a shame to give you trouble, but I should be very much
obliged if you could tell me where differently coloured eggs

getting facts. I have one good speculative line, but a man
must have entire credence in Natural Selection before he will
even listen to it. Psychologically, I have done scarcely any-
thing. Unless, indeed, expression of countenance can be
included, and on that subject I have collected a good many
facts, and speculated, but I do not suppose I shall ever
publish, but it is an uncommonly curious subject. By the
way I sent off a lot of questions the day before yesterday

in an address to the Botanical Society of Edinburgh, the
notice in the Linnean Journal, and has disposed of" the
whole theory by an ingenious difficulty, which I was very
stupid not to have thought of ; for I express surprise at more
and analogous cases not being known. The difficulty is, that
amongst the blind insects of the caves in distant parts of the
world there are some of the same genus, and yet the genus is
not found out of the caves or living in the free world. I have
little doubt that, like the fish Amblyopsis, and like Proteus in
Europe, these insects are wrecks of ancient life, or "living
fossils," saved from competition and e.xtermination. But that

have also told him that he would be pleased to hear that the

over the explanation given of Classification, Morphology,

My dear Sir.  I thank you for your extremely interesting

yours seemed to me very clear and good. Believe me that I
estimate its value most highly. Under a general point of view,
I am quite convinced (Hooker and Huxley took the same
view some months ago) that a philosophic view of nature can
solely be driven into naturalists by treating special subjects
as you have done. Under a special point of view, I think you
have solved one of the most perplexing problems which
could be given to solve. I am glad to hear from Hooker

that your reception at the British Museum would damp

appreciate your work. In fact I have long thought that
too much systematic work [and] description somehow blunts

admirable papers I ever read in my life. The mimetic cases
are truly marvellous, and you connect excellently a host of
analogous facts. The illustrations are beautiful, and seem
very well chosen ; but it would have saved the reader not a
little trouble, if the name of each had been engraved below
each separate figure. No doubt this would have put the
engraver into fits, as it would have destroyed the beauty of the
plate. I am not at all surprised at such a paper having con-
sumed much time. I am rejoiced that I passed over the
whole subject in the  Origin, for I should have made a pre-
cious mess of it. You have most clearly stated and solved
a wonderful problem. No doubt with most jjeople this will
be the cream of the paper ; but I am not sure that all your
facts and reasonings on variation, and on the segregation of
complete and semi-complete species, is not really more, or
at least as valuable, a part. I never conceived the process
nearly so clearly before ; one feels present at the creation of
new forms. I wish, however, you had enlarged a little more
on the pairing of similar varieties; a rather more numerous
body of facts seems here wanted. Then, again, what a host
of curious miscellaneous observations there arc  as on related
varieties of one species ; other mi-
mickers are undoubtedly distinct
species, or even distinct genera.
So again, some of the mimicked
forms can be shown to be merely
varieties ; but the greater number
must be ranked as distinct species.
Hence the creationist will have to
admit that some of these forms
have become imitators, by means
of the laws of variation, whilst
others he must look at as separately
created under their present guise ;
he will further have to admit that
some have been created in imita-
tion of forms not themselves created
as we now see them, but due to the
laws of variation! Prof. Agassiz,
indeed, would think nothing of this
difficulty ; for he believes that not
only each species and each variety,
but that groups of individuals,
though identically the same, when
inhabiting distinct countries, have
been all separately created in due
proportional numbers to the wants
of each land. Not many natur-
lieve that varieties and individuals
have been turned out all ready
made, almost as a manufacturer
turns out toys according to the

sexual and individual variability : these will some day, if I
live, be a treasure to me.
With respect to mimetic resemblance being so common
with insects, do you not think it may be connected with their
small size ; they cannot defend themselves ; they cannot
escape by flight, at least, from birds, therefore they escape
by trickery and deception ?
I have one serious criticism to make, and that is about the
title of the paper ; I cannot but think that you ought to have
called prominent attention in it to the mimetic resemblances.
Your paper is too good to be largely appreciated by the mob
of naturalists without souls ; but, rely on it, that it will have
lasting value, and I cordially congratulate you on your first
great work. You will find, I should think, that Wallace will
fully appreciate it How gets on your book ? Keep your
spirits up. A book is no light labour. I have been better
lately, and working hard, but my health is very indifferent

VARIATION OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS.
1863-1866.
His book on animals and plants under domestication was my
fathers chief employment in the year 1863. His diary
records the length of time spent over the composition of its
chapters, and shows the rate at which he arranged and wrote
out for printing the observations and deductions of several
years.
The three chapters in vol. ii. on inheritance, which occupy
84 pages of print, were begun in January and finished on
April 1st ; the five on crossing, making 106 pages, were written
in eight weeks, while the two chapters on selection, covering
57 pages, were begun on June 16th and finished on July 20th.
The work was more than once interrupted by ill-health,
and, in September, what proved to be tl>e beginning of a six
months illness forced him to leave home for the water-cure
at Malvern. He returned in October, and remained ill and
depressed, in spite of the hopeful opinion of one of the most
cheery and skilful physicians of the day. Thus he wrote to
Sir J. D. Hooker in November :
 Dr. Brinton has been here (recommended by Busk) ; he

does not believe my brain or heart are primarily affected, but I
have been so steadily going downhill, I cannot help doubting
whether I can ever crawl a little uphill again. Unless I can,
enough to work a little, I hope my life may be very short,
for to lie on a sofa all day and do nothing but give trouble to
the best and kindest of wives and good dear children is
dreadful.
The minor works in this year were a short paper in the
 Natural History Review  (N.S. vol. iii. p. 1 1 5), entitled  On
the so-called Auditory-Sac of Cirripedes, and one in the
 Geological Societys Journal  (vol. xix.), on the  Thickness of
the Pampjean Formation near Buenos Ayres. The paper
on Cirripedes was called forth by the criticisms of a German
naturalist Krohn,* and is of some interest in illustration of my
father's readiness to admit an error.
With regard to the spread of a belief in Evolution, it could
not yet be said that the battle was won, but the growth of
belief was undoubtedly rapid. So that, for instance, Charles

you like on how far variation and natural selection suffices.
I hope to Heaven I am wrong (and from what you say about
Whewell it seems so), but I cannot see how your chapters can
do more good than an extraordinary able review. I think
the Parthenon is right, that you will leave the public in a fog.
No doubt they may infer that as you give more space to
myself, Wallace, and Hooker, than to Lamarck, you think
more of us. But I had always thought that your judgment
would have been an epoch in the subject All that is over
with me, and I will only think on the admirable skill with
which you have selected the striking points, and explained
them. No praise can be too strong, in my opinion, for the

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to C. Lyell.
Down, 12th [March, 1863].
My DEAR Lyell,  I thank you for your very interesting
and kind, I may say, charming letter. I feared you might be
huffed for a little time with me. I know some men would
have been so. I have hardly any more criticisms, anyhow,
worth writing. But I may mention that I felt a little surprise
that old B. de Perthes * was not rather more honourably men-
tioned. I would suggest whether you could not leave out
some references to the  Principles ;  one for the real student
is as good as a hundred, and it is rather irritating, and gives
a feeling of incompleteness to the general reader to be often
referred to other books. As you say that you have gone as far
as you believe on the species question, I have not a word to
say ; but I must feel convinced that at times, judging from
conversation, expressions, letters, &c., you have as completely
given up belief in immutability of specific forms as I have
done. I must still think a clear expression from you, if you
could have given it, would have been potent with the public,
and all the more so, as you formerly held opposite opinions.
The more I work, the more satisfied I become with variation
and natural selection, but that part of the case I look at as
less important, though more interesting to me personally. As
you ask for criticisms on this head (and believe me that

I should not have made them unasked), I may specify
(pp. 412, 413) that such words as  Mr. D. labours to show,
is believed by the author to throw light, would lead a
common reader to think that you yourself do not at all agree,
but merely think it fair to give my opinion. Lastly, you
refer repeatedly to my view as a modification of Lamarcks
doctrine of development and progression. If this is your
deliberate opinion there is nothing to be said, but it does
not seem so to me. Plato, Buffon, my grandfather before
Lamarck, and others, propounded the obvious view that if
species were not created separately they must have descended
from other species, and I can see nothing else in common
between the  Origin  and Lamarck. I believe this way of
putting the case is very injurious to its acceptance, as it
implies necessary progression, and closely connects Wallaces
and my views with what I consider, after two deliberate
readings, as a wretched book, and one from which (I well
remember my surprise) I gained nothing. But I know you
rank it higher, which is curious, as it did not in the least
shake your belief. But enough, and more than enough.
Please remember you have brought it all down on yourself ! !

attempt to explain specific transmutation are in fact related
to it in this wise, that they have prepared the minds of
naturalists for a better reception of such attempts to explain
the way of the origin of species from species.
To this my father replied as follows in the A thenceum of
May 9th, 1863 :]
Down, May 5 [1863].
I hope that you will grant me space to own that your
reviewer is quite correct when he states that any theory of
descent will connect,  by an intelligible thread of reasoning,
the several generalizations before specified. I ought to have
made this admission expressly; with the reservation, how-
ever, that, as far as I can judge, no theory so well explains or
connects these several generalizations (more especially the
formation of domestic races in comparison with natural
species, the principles of classification, embryonic resemblance,
&c.) as the theory, or hypothesis, or guess, if the reviewer so
likes to call it, of Natural Selection. Nor has any other
satisfactory explanation been ever offered of the almost
perfect adaptation of all organic beings to each other, and to
their physical conditions of life. Whether the naturalist
believes in the views given by Lamarck, by Geoffrey St.
Hilaire, by the author of the 1 Vestiges, by Mr. Wallace and
myself, or in any other such view, signifies extremely little in
comparison with the admission that species have descended
from other species, and have not been created immutable ;
for he who admits this as a great truth has a wide field
opened to him for further inquiry. I believe, however, from
what I see of the progress of opinion on the Continent, and in
this country, that the theory of Natural Selection will
ultimately be adopted, with, no doubt, many subordinate
modifications and improvements.

Down, Thursday, 27th [Sept. 186;].
My DEAR HOOKER,  I had intended writing this morning
to thank Mrs. Hooker most sincerely for her last and several
notes about you, and now your own note in your hand has
rejoiced me. To walk between five and six miles is splendid,
with a little patience you must soon be well. I knew you had
been very ill, but I hardly knew how ill, until yesterday, when
Bentham (from the Cranworths *) called here, and I was able
to see him for ten minutes. He told me also a little about
the last days of your father ; t I wish I had known your father
better, my impression is confined to his remarkably cordial,
courteous and frank bearing. I fully concur and understand
what you say about the difference of feeling in the loss of a
father and child. I do not think any one could love a father
much more than I did mine, and I do not believe three or four
days ever pass without my still thinking of him, but his death
at eighty-four caused me nothing of that insufferable grief {
which the loss of poor dear Annie caused. And this seems to
me perfectly natural, for one knows that for years previously

t Sir Wm. Hooker; b. 1785,
d. 1865. He took charge of the
Royal Gardens at Kew, in 1840,
when they ceased to be the private
gardens of the Royal Family. In
doing so, he gave up his professor-
ship at Glasgow  and with it half
of his income. He founded the
herbarium and library, and within
ten years he succeeded in making
the gardens the first in the world.
It is, thus, not too much to say that
the creation of the establishment
at Kew is due to the abilities and
self-devotion of Sir William Hooker.
While, for the subsequent develop-
ment of the gardens up to their
present magnificent condition, the
nation must thank Sir Joseph
Hooker, in whom the same qualities
are so conspicuous.
t I may quote here a passage
from a letter of November 1863.
It was written to a friend who had
lost his child :  How well I re-
member your feeling, when we lost
Annie. It was my greatest comfort
that I had never spoken a harsh
word to her. Your grief has made

after hearing what you say, I feel sure that this is the case,

There seems to have been a gradual amendment in his
health ; thus he wrote to Mr. Wallace (January 1866) :   My
health is so far improved that I am able to work one or two
hours a day.
With respect to the 4th edition he wrote to Sir J. D.
Hooker :
The new edition of the Origin has caused me two
great vexations. I forgot Batess paper on variation* but I
remembered in time his mimetic work, and now, strange to
say, I find I have forgotten your Arctic paper 1 I know how
it arose ; I indexed for my bigger work, and never expected
that a new edition of the  Origin  would be wanted.
I cannot say how all this has vexed me. Everything
which I have read during the last four years I find is quite
washy in my mind. As far as I know, Mr. Batess paper
was not mentioned in the later editions of the Origin,
for what reason I cannot say.
In connection with his work on The Variation of
Animals and Plants, I give here extracts from three letters
addressed to Mr. Huxley, which are of interest as giving
some idea of the development of the theory of  Pangenesis,
ultimately published in 1868 in the book in question :]

It was thoroughly enjoyed amid roars of laughter and noise,

I am rejoiced that you will publish your lecture, and felt sure
that sooner or later it would come to this, indeed it would
have been a sin if you had not done so. I am especially
rejoiced as you give the arguments for occasional transport
with such perfect fairness ; these will now receive a fair share
of attention, as coming from you, a professed botanist. Thanks
also for Groves address ; as a whole it strikes me as very
good and original, but I was disappointed in the part about

Dear Haeckel.  -Your letter of the 18th has given me
great pleasure, for you have received what I said in the most
kind and cordial manner. You have in part taken what I
said much stronger than I had intended. It never occurred
to me for a moment to doubt that your work, with the whole

subject so admirably and clearly arranged, as well as fortified
by so many new facts and arguments, would not advance our
common object in the highest degree. All that I think is
that you will excite anger, and that anger so completely
blinds every one, that your arguments would have no chance
of influencing those who are already opposed to our views.
Moreover, I do not at all like that you, towards whom I feel
so much friendship, should unnecessarily make enemies, and
there is pain and vexation enough in the world without more
being caused. But I repeat that I can feel no doubt that
your work will greatly advance our subject, and I heartily
wish it could be translated into English, for my own sake and
that of others. With respect to what you say about my
advancing too strongly objections against my own views, some
of my English friends think that I have erred on this side ;
but truth compelled me to write what I did, and I am inclined
to think it was good policy. The belief in the descent theory
is slowly spreading in England,* even amongst those who can
give no reason for their belief. No body of men were at first
so much opposed to my views as the members of the London
Entomological Society, but now I am assured that, with the
exception of two or three old men, all the members concur
with me to a certain extent. It has been a great disappoint-
ment to me that I have never received your long letter written
to me from the Canary Islands. I am rejoiced to hear that
your tour, which seems to have been a most interesting one,
has done your health much good. I am working away at my
new book, but make very slow progress, and the work tries my
health, which is much the same as when you were here.

is a relief to have some feasible explanation of the various
facts, which can be given up as soon as any better hypo-

to my mind ; for I have been stumbling over the subject for
years, dimly seeing that some relation existed between the
various classes of facts. I now hear from H. Spencer that his
views quoted in my foot-note refer to something quite distinct,

I shall be very glad to hear at some future day your criti-

I am right about sterility and natural selection. . . . I do not
quite understand your case, and we think that a word or two

under the following point of view :  If sterility is caused or
accumulated through natural selection, then as every degree
exists up to absolute barrenness, natural selection must have
the power of increasing it. Now take two species, A and B,
and assume that they are (by any means) half-sterile, i.e.
produce half the full number of offspring. Now try and make
(by natural selection) A and B absolutely sterile when
crossed, and you will find how difficult it is. I grant, indeed
it is certain, that the degree of sterility of the individuals A
and B will vary, but any such extra-sterile individuals of, we
will say A, if they should hereafter breed with other indi-
viduals of A, will bequeath no advantage to their progeny, by
which these families will tend to increase in number over
other families of A, which are not more sterile when crossed
with B. But I do not know that I have made this any
clearer than in the chapter in my book. It is a most difficult
bit of reasoning, which I have gone over and over again on

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to J. D. Hooker.
Down, February 28 [1868].
My dear Hooker, I have been deeply interested by
your letter, and we had a good laugh over Huxleys remark,
which was so deuced clever that you could not recollect it. I
cannot quite follow your train of thought, for in the last page
you admit all that I wish, having apparently denied all, or
thought all mere words in the previous pages of your note ;
but it may be my muddle. I see clearly that any satisfaction
which Pan may give will depend on the constitution of each
mans mind. If you have arrived already at any similar
conclusion, the whole will of course appear stale to you. I
heard yesterday from Wallace, who says (excuse horrid
vanity), "I can hardly tell you how much I admire the
chapter on  Pangenesis. It is a positive comfort to me to
have any feasible explanation of a difficulty that has always
been haunting me, and I shall never be able to give it up till
a better one supplies its place, and that I think hardly
possible, 8cc. Now his foregoing [italicised] words express
my sentiments exactly and fully: though perhaps I feel
the relief extra strongly from having during many years
vainly attempted to form some hypothesis. When you or
Huxley say that a single cell of a plant, or the stump of an
amputated limb, has the potentiality of reproducing the
whole  or diffuses an influence, these words give me no
positive idea ;  but, when it is said that the cells of a plant,
or stump, include atoms derived from every other cell of the
whole organism and capable of development, I gain a distinct
idea. But this idea would not be worth a rush, if it applied
to one case alone ; but it seems to me to apply to all the
forms of reproduction  inheritance  metamorphosis  to the

abnormal transposition of organs  to the direct action of the
male element on the mother plant, &c. Therefore I fully
believe that each cell does actually throw off an atom or
gemmule of its contents ;  but whether or not, this hypothesis
serves as a useful connecting link for various grand classes
of physiological facts, which at present stand absolutely
isolated.
I have touched on the doubtful point (alluded to by
Huxley) how far atoms derived from the same cell may
become developed into different structure accordingly as they
are differently nourished ; I advanced as illustrations galls
and polypoid excrescences. . . .
It is a real pleasure to me to write to you on this subject,

Down, February 26 [1867],
My DEAR Wallace,  Bates was quite right ; you are the
man to apply to in a difficulty. I never heard anything
more ingenious than your suggestion* and I hope you may
be able to prove it true. That is a splendid fact about the
white moths ; it warms ones very blood to see a theory thus
almost proved to be true.f With respect to the beauty of
male butterflies, I must as yet think that it is due to sexual
selection. There is some evidence that dragon-flies are
attracted by bright colours ; but what leads me to the above
belief, is so many male Orthoptera and Cicadas having
musical instruments. This being the case, the analogy of
birds makes me believe in sexual selection with respect to
colour in insects. I wish I had strength and time to make
some of the experiments suggested by you, but I thought
butterflies would not pair in confinement I am sure I have
heard of some such difficulty. Many years ago I had a

opportunity of fairly trying it.
The reason of my being so much interested just at present
about sexual selection is, that I have almost resolved to
publish a little essay on the origin of Mankind, and I still
strongly think (though I failed to convince you, and this, to
me, is the heaviest blow possible) that sexual selection has
been the main agent in forming the races of man.

My DEAR Wallace,  Bates was quite right ; you are the
man to apply to in a difficulty. I never heard anything
more ingenious than your suggestion* and I hope you may
be able to prove it true. That is a splendid fact about the
white moths ; it warms ones very blood to see a theory thus
almost proved to be true.f With respect to the beauty of
male butterflies, I must as yet think that it is due to sexual
selection. There is some evidence that dragon-flies are
attracted by bright colours ; but what leads me to the above
belief, is so many male Orthoptera and Cicadas having
musical instruments. This being the case, the analogy of
birds makes me believe in sexual selection with respect to
colour in insects. I wish I had strength and time to make
some of the experiments suggested by you, but I thought
butterflies would not pair in confinement I am sure I have
heard of some such difficulty. Many years ago I had a

I found the subject too large for a chapter. Nor shall I be
capable of treating the subject well, and my sole reason for
taking it up is, that I am pretty well convinced that sexual
selection has played an important part in the formation of
races, and sexual selection has always been a subject which
has interested me much. I have been very glad to see your

fully agree with you that the subject is in no way an im-

been given to man solely that he may reveal to other men
his feelings. I want to try and show how expressions have
arisen. That is a good suggestion about newspapers, but my

My DEAR old Friend,  I have received your note I
can hardly say how pleased I have been at the success of
your address,* and of the whole meeting. I have seen the
Times, Telegraph, Spectator, and Athenaum, and have heard
of other favourable newspapers, and have ordered a bundle.
There is a chorus of praise. The Times reported miserably,
ie. as far as errata were concerned ; but I was very glad at
the leader, for I thought the way you brought in the mcga-
lithic monuments most happy.f I particularly admired
Tyndalls little speech.^ . . . The Spectator pitches a little into
you about Theology, in accordance with its usual spirit . . .
Your great success has rejoiced my heart I have just
carefully read the whole address in the A thenceum ; and
though, as you know, I liked it very much when you read it
to me, yet, as I was trying all the time to find fault, I missed
to a certain extent the effect as a whole; and this now

appears to me most striking and excellent. How you must
rejoice at all your bothering labour and anxiety having had
so grand an end. I must say a word about myself ; never
has such a eulogium been passed on me, and it makes me
very proud. I cannot get over my amazement at what you
say about my botanical work. By Jove, as far as my
memory goes, you have strengthened instead of weakened
some of the expressions. What is far more important than
anything personal, is the conviction which I feel, that you
will have immensely advanced the belief in the evolution of
species. This will follow from the publicity of the occasion,
your position, so responsible, as President, and your own high
reputation. It will make a great step in public opinion, I feel
sure, and I had not thought of this before. The A thenceum
takes your snubbing * with the utmost mildness. I certainly
do rejoice over the snubbing, and hope [the reviewer] will
feel it a little. Whenever you have spare time to write again,
tell me whether any astronomers f took your remarks in ill
part ; as they now stand they do not seem at all too harsh
and presumptuous. Many of your sentences strike me as
extremely felicitous and eloquent That of Lyells  under-
pinning, f is capital. Tell me, was Lyell pleased ? I am so
glad that you remembered my old dedication.! Was Wallace
pleased ?

[In the A thenceum of November 29, 1868, appeared an
article which was in fact a reply to Sir Joseph Hooker's
remarks at Norwich. He seems to have consulted my father
as to the wisdom of answering the article. My father wrote
to him on December 1 :
 In my opinion Dr. Joseph Dalton Hooker need take no
notice of the attack in the A thenceum in reference to Mr.
Charles Darwin. What an ass the man is, to think he cuts
one to the quick by giving ones Christian name in full. How
transparently false is the statement that my sole groundwork
is from pigeons, because I state I have worked them out more
fully than other beings ! He muddles together two books of
Flourens.
The following letter refers to a paperf by Judge Caton, of
which my father often spoke with admiration :]

" I have been interrupted in my regular work in preparing

and which I hope I have considerably improved in two or
three important points. I always thought individual differ-
ences more important than single variations, but now I have
come to the conclusion that they are of paramount import-
ance, and in this I believe I agree with you. Fleeming

thought individual differences more important ; but I was
blind and thought that single variations might be preserved
much oftener than I now see is possible or probable. I men-

made on his views should have come, not from a professed
naturalist but from a Professor of Engineering.

sneers   but it should be remembered that he used the word

a feeling of bitterness in the critic, but rather in the sense
of  banter. Speaking of the * true believer, Fleeming Jenkin
says, p. 293
 He can invent trains of ancestors of whose existence
there is no evidence ; he can marshal hosts of equally imagi-
nary foes ; he can call up continents, floods, and peculiar
atmospheres ; he can dry up oceans, split islands, and parcel
out eternity at will ; surely with these advantages he must be
a dull fellow if he cannot scheme some series of animals and
circumstances explaining our assumed difficulty quite natur-
ally. Feeling the difficulty of dealing with adversaries who
command so huge a domain of fancy, we will abandon these
arguments, and trust to those which at least cannot be assailed
by mere efforts of imagination.
In the fifth edition of the  Origin, my father altered a
passage in the Historical Sketch (fourth edition, p. xviii). He
thus practically gave up the difficult task of understanding
whether or not Sir R. Owen claims to have discovered the
principle of Natural Selection. Adding, As far as the mere
enunciation of the principle of Natural Selection is concerned,
it is quite immaterial whether or not Professor Owen preceded

My dear Wallace,  I have been wonderfully interested

gratified by it I declare if I had been editor, and had the
power of directing you, I should have selected for discussion
the very points which you have chosen. I have often said to
younger geologists (for I began in the year 1830) that they

My DEAR WALLACE,  I am very much obliged for all your
trouble in writing me your long letter, which I will keep by
me and ponder over. To answer it would require at least
200 folio pages 1 If you could see how often I have re-written
some pages you would know how anxious I am to arrive as
near as I can to the truth. I lay great stress on what I know
takes place under domestication; I think we start with
different fundamental notions on inheritance. I find it is
most difficult, but not I think impossible, to see how, for
instance, a few red feathers appearing on the head of a
male bird, and which are at first tratismitted to both sexes,
could come to be transmitted to males alone. It is not
enough that females should be produced from the males
with red feathers, which should be destitute of red feathers ;
but these females must have a latent tendency to produce
such feathers, otherwise they would cause deterioration
in the red head-feathers of their male offspring. Such
124 WORK ON MAN. [187a
latent tendency would be shown by their producing the
red feathers when old, or diseased in their ovaria. But
I have no difficulty in making the whole head red if the
few red feathers in the male from the first tended to be
sexually transmitted. I am quite willing to admit that the
female may have been modified, either at the same time
or subsequently, for protection by the accumulation of varia-
tions limited in their transmission to the female sex. I owe to
your writings the consideration of this latter point But I
cannot yet persuade myself that females alone have often
been modified for protection. Should you grudge the trouble
briefly to tell me, whether you believe that the plainer head
and less bright colours of ? chaffinch* the less red on the head
and less clean colours of ? goldfinch, the much less red on
the breast of ? bullfinch, the paler crest of golden-crested
wren, &c., have been acquired by them for protection. I
cannot think so, any more than I can that the considerable
differences between $ and $ house sparrow, or much greater
brightness of $ Parus cceruleus (both of which build under
cover) than of ? Parus , are related to protection. I even
misdoubt much whether the less blackness of 9 blackbird is
for protection.
Again, can you give me reasons for believing that the
moderate differences between the female pheasant, the female
Gallus bankiva, the female of black grouse, the pea-hen, the
female partridge, have all special references to protection under
slightly different conditions ? I, of course, admit that they are
all protected by dull colours, derived, as I think, from some
dull-ground progenitor ; and I account partly for their
difference by partial transference of colour from the male,
and by other means too long to specify ; but I earnestly wish
to see reason to believe that each is specially adapted for
concealment to its environment.
I grieve to differ from you, and it actually terrifies me and

quite understand each other. I value the cases of bright-
coloured, incubating male fishes, and brilliant female butter-
flies, solely as showing that one sex may be made brilliant
without any necessary transference of beauty to the other
sex ; for in these cases I cannot suppose that beauty in the
other sex was checked by selection.

with the least disrespect, and it is so difficult to speak fairly
when differing from any one. If I had offended you, it
would have grieved me more than you will readily believe.
Secondly, I am greatly pleased to hear that Vol. I. interests
you ; I have got so sick of the whole subject that I felt in
utter doubt about the value of any part. I intended, when
speaking of females not having been specially modified for
protection, to include the prevention of characters acquired
by the $ being transmitted to 9 ; but I now see it would have
been better to have said  specially acted on, or some such term.
Possibly my intention may be clearer in Vol. II. Let me say
that my conclusions are chiefly founded on the consideration
of all animals taken in a body, bearing in mind how common
the rules of sexual differences appear to be in all classes.
The first copy of the chapter on Lepidoptera agreed pretty
closely with you. I then worked on, came back to Lepi-
doptera, and thought myself compelled to alter it  finished
Sexual Selection and for the last time went over Lepidoptera,
and again I felt forced to alter it. I hope to God there will
be nothing disagreeable to you in Vol. II., and that I have
spoken fairly of your views ; I am fearful on this head, because
I have just read (but not with sufficient care) Mivarts book,*
and I feel absolutely certain that he meant to be fair (but he
was stimulated by theological fervour) ; yet I do not think he
has been quite fair. . . . The part which, I think, will have
most influence is where he^gives the whole series of cases like
that of the whalebone, in which we cannot explain the grada-
tional steps ; but such cases have no weight on my mind  if a
few fish were extinct, who on earth would have ventured even
to conjecture that lungs had originated in a swim-bladder?
In such a case as the Thylacine, I think he was bound to say
that the resemblance of the jaw to that of the dog is super-
ficial ; the number and correspondence and development of
teeth being widely different. I think again when speaking

of the necessity of altering a number of characters together,
he ought to have thought of man having power by selection
to modify simultaneously or almost simultaneously many
points, as in making a greyhound or racehorse  as enlarged
upon in my  Domestic Animals. Mivart is savage or con-
temptuous about my  moral sense, and so probably will yon
be. I am extremely pleased that he agrees with my position,
as far as animal nature is concerned, of man in the series ; or
if anything, thinks I have erred in making him too distinct.
Forgive me for scribbling at such length. You have put me
quite in good spirits ; I did so dread having been uninten-
tionally unfair towards your views. I hope earnestly the
second volume will escape as well. I care now very little what
others say. As for our not quite agreeing, really in such
complex subjects, it is almost impossible for two men who
arrive independently at their conclusions to agree fully, it
would be unnatural for them to do so.

My dear WALLACE,  Your note * has given me very great
pleasure, chiefly because I was so anxious not to treat you
* In the note referred to, dated
January 27, Mr. Wallace wrote :
 Many thanks for your first volume
which I have just finished reading
through with the greatest pleasure
and interest ; and I have also to
thank you for the great tenderness
with which you have treated me
and my heresies.
The heresy is the limitation of
natural selection as applied to man.
My father wrote ( Descent of
Man, i. p. 137) :   I cannot there-
fore understand how it is that Mr.
Wallace maintains that natural
selection could only have endowed
the savage with a brain a little
superior to that of an ape. In
the above quoted letter Mr. Wallace
wrote :   Your chapters on  Man '
are of intense interest, but as touch-
ing my special heresy not as yet

with the least disrespect, and it is so difficult to speak fairly
when differing from any one. If I had offended you, it
would have grieved me more than you will readily believe.
Secondly, I am greatly pleased to hear that Vol. I. interests
you ; I have got so sick of the whole subject that I felt in
utter doubt about the value of any part. I intended, when
speaking of females not having been specially modified for
protection, to include the prevention of characters acquired
by the $ being transmitted to 9 ; but I now see it would have
been better to have said  specially acted on, or some such term.
Possibly my intention may be clearer in Vol. II. Let me say
that my conclusions are chiefly founded on the consideration
of all animals taken in a body, bearing in mind how common
the rules of sexual differences appear to be in all classes.
The first copy of the chapter on Lepidoptera agreed pretty
closely with you. I then worked on, came back to Lepi-
doptera, and thought myself compelled to alter it  finished
Sexual Selection and for the last time went over Lepidoptera,
and again I felt forced to alter it. I hope to God there will
be nothing disagreeable to you in Vol. II., and that I have
spoken fairly of your views ; I am fearful on this head, because
I have just read (but not with sufficient care) Mivarts book,*
and I feel absolutely certain that he meant to be fair (but he
was stimulated by theological fervour) ; yet I do not think he
has been quite fair. . . . The part which, I think, will have
most influence is where he^gives the whole series of cases like
that of the whalebone, in which we cannot explain the grada-
tional steps ; but such cases have no weight on my mind  if a
few fish were extinct, who on earth would have ventured even
to conjecture that lungs had originated in a swim-bladder?
In such a case as the Thylacine, I think he was bound to say
that the resemblance of the jaw to that of the dog is super-
ficial ; the number and correspondence and development of
teeth being widely different. I think again when speaking

of the necessity of altering a number of characters together,
he ought to have thought of man having power by selection
to modify simultaneously or almost simultaneously many
points, as in making a greyhound or racehorse  as enlarged

My DEAR Wallace,  I have just read your grand review.*
It is in every way as kindly expressed towards myself as it is
excellent in matter. The Lyells have been here, and Sir C.
remarked that no one wrote such good scientific reviews as
you, and as Miss Buckley added, you delight in picking out
all that is good, though very far from blind to the bad. In
all this I most entirely agree. I shall always consider your
review as a great honour ; and however much my book may
hereafter be abused, as no doubt it will be, your review will
console me, notwithstanding that we differ so greatly. I will
keep your objections to my views in my mind, but I fear that
the latter are almost stereotyped in my mind. I thought for
long weeks about the inheritance and selection difficulty, and
covered quires of paper with notes in trying to get out of it,
but could not, though clearly seeing that it would be a great
relief if I could. I will confine myself to two or three
remarks. I have been much impressed with what you urge
against colour, t in the case of insects, having been acquired
tiirlichc Schdpfungs - gcschichte,
in which he fully discusses the
genealogy of man. If this work
had appeared before my essay
had been written, I should pro-
bably never have completed it.

which I have arrived, I find con-
firmed by this naturalist, whose
knowledge on many points is much
fuller than mine.

was very weak ; but I still think, if it be admitted that the
musical instruments of insects have been gained through
sexual selection, that there is not the least improbability in
colour having been thus gained. Your argument with respect
to the denudation of mankind and also to insects, that taste
on the part of one sex would have to remain nearly the same
during many generations, in order that sexual selection should
produce any effect, I agree to; and I think this argument
would be sound if used by one who denied that, for instance,
the plumes of birds of Paradise had been so gained. I believe
you admit this, and if so I do not see how your argument
applies in other cases. I have recognised for some short time
that I have made a great omission in not having discussed, as
far as I could, the acquisition of taste, its inherited nature,
and its permanence within pretty close limits for long periods.

Down, April 29 [1871].
My dear Dr. Ogle,  I am truly obliged for all the
great trouble which you have so kindly taken. I am sure
you have no cause to say that you are sorry you can give me
no definite information, for you have given me far more than
I ever expected to get. The action of the platysma is not
very important for me, but 1 believe that you will fully
understand (for I have always fancied that our minds were
very similar) the intolerable desire I had not to be utterly
baffled. Now I know that it sometimes contracts from fear
and from shuddering, but not apparently from a prolonged
state of fear such as the insane suffer. . . .
[Mr. Mivarts Genesis of Species,  a contribution to the
literature of Evolution, which excited much attention,  was
published in 1871, before the appearance of the Descent of

from the late Chauncey Wright * to my father, refers :
I send . . . revised proofs of an article which will be
published in the July number of the  North American
Review, sending it in the hope that it will interest or even be
of greater value to you. Mr. Mivarts book [Genesis of

to me a very good background from which to present the
considerations which I have endeavoured to set forth in the

eventful life, supported by the small
stipend of his office, and by what
he earned from his occasional
articles, as well by a little teaching.
He thought and read much on
metaphysical subjects, but on the
whole with an outcome (as far as
the world was concerned) not com-

friends. He died in Sept 1875.

Selection. My special purpose has been to contribute to the
theory by placing it in its proper relations to philosophical
inquiries in general. *
With regard to the proofs received from Mr. Wright, my
father wrote to Mr. Wallace :]
Down, July 9 [1871].
My dear Wallace,  I send by this post a review by
Chauncey Wright, as I much want your opinion of it as soon
as you can send it I consider you an incomparably better
critic than I am. The article, though not very clearly
written, and poor in parts from want of knowledge, seems
to me admirable. Mivarts book is producing a great effect
against Natural Selection, and more especially against me
Therefore if you think the article even somewhat good I will
write and get permission to publish it as a shilling pamphlet,
together with the MS. additions (enclosed), for which there
was not room at the end of the review. . . .
I am now at work at a new and cheap edition of the
Origin, and shall answer several points in Mivarts book,
and introduce a new chapter for this purpose ; but I treat the
subject so much more concretely, and I dare say less philo-
sophically, than Wright, that we shall not interfere with each
other. You will think me a bigot when I say, after studying
Mivart, I was never before in my life so convinced of the
general (t.e. not in detail) truth of the views in the ' Origin.'
I grieve to see the omission of the words by Mivart, detected
by Wright, t I complained to Mivart that in two cases he
quotes only the commencement of sentences by me, and thus

My dear Dr. Ogle,  I am truly obliged for all the
great trouble which you have so kindly taken. I am sure
you have no cause to say that you are sorry you can give me
no definite information, for you have given me far more than
I ever expected to get. The action of the platysma is not
very important for me, but 1 believe that you will fully
understand (for I have always fancied that our minds were
very similar) the intolerable desire I had not to be utterly
baffled. Now I know that it sometimes contracts from fear
and from shuddering, but not apparently from a prolonged
state of fear such as the insane suffer. . . .
[Mr. Mivarts Genesis of Species,  a contribution to the

from the late Chauncey Wright * to my father, refers :

of greater value to you. Mr. Mivarts book [Genesis of

to me a very good background from which to present the

He became in 1852 a computer in
the Nautical Almanac office at Cam-

eventful life, supported by the small
stipend of his office, and by what
he earned from his occasional
articles, as well by a little teaching.
He thought and read much on
metaphysical subjects, but on the
whole with an outcome (as far as
the world was concerned) not com-

strong individuality, and to have
made a lasting impression on his
friends. He died in Sept 1875.

With regard to the proofs received from Mr. Wright, my
father wrote to Mr. Wallace :]
Down, July 9 [1871].
My dear Wallace,  I send by this post a review by
Chauncey Wright, as I much want your opinion of it as soon
as you can send it I consider you an incomparably better
critic than I am. The article, though not very clearly
written, and poor in parts from want of knowledge, seems
to me admirable. Mivarts book is producing a great effect
against Natural Selection, and more especially against me
Therefore if you think the article even somewhat good I will
write and get permission to publish it as a shilling pamphlet,
together with the MS. additions (enclosed), for which there
was not room at the end of the review. . . .
I am now at work at a new and cheap edition of the
Origin, and shall answer several points in Mivarts book,
and introduce a new chapter for this purpose ; but I treat the
subject so much more concretely, and I dare say less philo-
sophically, than Wright, that we shall not interfere with each
other. You will think me a bigot when I say, after studying
Mivart, I was never before in my life so convinced of the
general (t.e. not in detail) truth of the views in the ' Origin.'
I grieve to see the omission of the words by Mivart, detected
by Wright, t I complained to Mivart that in two cases he

MY dear Huxley,  It was very good of you to send the
proof-sheets, for I was very anxious to read your article. I
have been delighted with it. How you do smash Mivarts
theology : it is almost equal to your article versus Comte,  *
that never can be transcended. . . . But I have been pre-
eminently glad to read your discussion on [the  Quarterly 1
reviewers] metaphysics, especially about reason and his de-
finition of it. I felt sure he was wrong, but having only
common observation and sense to trust to, I did not know
what to say in my second edition of my  Descent Now a
footnote and reference to you will do the work. . . . For me,
this is one of the most important parts of the review. But for
pleasure, I have been particularly glad that my few words t on
the distinction, if it can be so called, between Mivarts two
forms of morality, caught your attention. I am so pleased
that you take the same view, and give authorities for it ; but I
searched Mill in vain on this head. How well you argue the
whole case. I am mounting climax on climax ; for after all
there is nothing, I think, better in your whole review than your
 'Fortnightly Review, 1869.
With regard to the relations of
Positivism to Science, my father
wrote to Mr. Spencer in 1875 :

see to what an extent the Positivists

laughable and gigantic blunders

you what Hooker said to me a few years ago.  When I read
Huxley, I feel quite infantile in intellect. By Jove I have
felt the truth of this throughout your review. What a man
you are. There are scores of splendid passages, and vivid
flashes of wit. I have been a good deal more than merely
pleased by the concluding part of your review ; and all the
more, as I own I felt mortified by the accusation of bigotry,
arrogance, &c., in the * Quarterly Review. But I assure you,
he may write his worst, and he will never mortify me again.

interests me greatly, for the same idea had occurred to me in

rudiments of old customs. . . . You will perhaps be surprised
at my writing at so late a period, but I have had the book
read aloud to me, and from much ill-health of late, could only
stand occasional short reads. The undertaking must have
cost you gigantic labour. Nevertheless, I earnestly hope that
you may be induced to treat morals in the same enlarged yet
careful manner, as you have animism. I fancy from the last
chapter that you have thought of this. No man could do the
work so well as you, and the subject assuredly is a most
important and interesting one. You must now possess refer-
ences which would guide you to a sound estimation of the
morals of savages ; and how writers like Wallace, Lubbock,
&c. &c., do differ on this head. Forgive me for troubling
you, and believe me, with much respect,

[At the beginning of the year the sixth edition of the
Origin, which had been begun in June 1871, was nearly
completed. The last sheet was revised on January 10, 1872,
and the book was published in the course of the month.
This volume differs from the previous ones in appearance
and size  it consists of 458 pp. instead of 596 pp., and is a
few ounces lighter ; it is printed on bad paper, in small type,
and with the lines unpleasantly close together. It had, how-
ever, one advantage over the previous editions, namely that
it was issued at a lower price. It is to be regretted that this
the final edition of the  Origin  should have appeared in
so unattractive a form ; a form which has doubtless kept many
readers from the book.
The discussion suggested by the  Genesis of Species  was
perhaps the most important addition to the book. The ob-
jection that incipient structures cannot be of use, was dealt
with in some detail, because it seemed to the author that this

was the point in Mr. Mivarts book which had struck most
readers in England.
It is a striking proof of how wide and general had become
the acceptance of his views, that my father found it necessary
to insert (sixth edition, p. 424), the sentence :  As a record
of a former state of things, I have retained in the foregoing
paragraphs and also elsewhere, several sentences which imply
that naturalists believe in the separate creation of each
species ; and I have been much censured for having thus
expressed myself. But undoubtedly this was the general
belief when the first edition of the present work appeared. . .
Now things are wholly changed, and almost every naturalist
admits the great principle of evolution."
A small correction introduced into this sixth edition is
connected with one of his minor papers :  Note on the habits
of the Pampas Woodpecker."  The paper in question was a
reply to Mr. Hudsons remarks on the woodpecker in a
previous number of the same journal. The last sentence of
my fathers paper is worth quoting for its temperate tone :
 Finally, I trust that Mr. Hudson is mistaken when he says
that any one acquainted with the habits of this bird might
be induced to believe that I had purposely wrested the
truth in order to prove my theory. He exonerates me
from this charge ; but I should be loath to think that there
are many naturalists who, without any evidence, would
accuse a fellow-worker of telling a deliberate falsehood to
prove his theory. In the fifth edition of the  Origin, p. 220,
he wrote :
 Yet as I can assert not only from my own observation, but
from that of the accurate Azara, it [the ground woodpecker]
never climbs a tree. In the sixth edition, p. 142, the passage
runs  in certain large districts it does not climb trees. And
he goes on to give Mr. Hudsons statement, that in other
regions it does frequent trees.

154 DESCENT OF MAN  EXPRESSION. [1872.
One of the additions in the sixth edition (p. 149), was a
reference to Mr. A. Hyatts and Professor Copes theory of
 acceleration. With regard to this he wrote (October 10,
1872) in characteristic words to Mr. Hyatt :
 Permit me to take this opportunity to express my sincere
regret at having committed two grave errors in the last
edition of my 1 Origin of Species, in my allusion to yours and
Professor Copes views on acceleration and retardation of de-
velopment I had thought that Professor Cope had preceded
you ; but I now well remember having formerly read with
lively interest, and marked, a paper by you somewhere in my
library, on fossil Cephalopods with remarks on the subject.
It seems also that I have quite misrepresented your joint
view. This has vexed me much. I confess that I have
never been able to grasp fully what you wish to show, and I
presume that this must be owing to some dulness on my
part.
The sixth edition of the Origin being intended as a
popular one, was made to include a glossary of technical
terms,  given because several readers have complained . . .
that some of the terms used were unintelligible to them.
The glossary was compiled by Mr. Dallas, and being an
excellent collection of clear and sufficient definitions, must
have proved useful to many readers.]

rather prefer not sending it, and in this case please to tear it

My DEAR WALLACE,  I have at last finished the gigantic
job of reading Dr. Bastians book,* and have been deeply
interested by it You wished to hear my impression, but it
is not worth sending.
He seems to me an extremely able man, as, indeed, I
thought when I read his first essay. His general argument
in favour of Archebiosis f is wonderfully strong, though I
cannot think much of some few of his arguments. The result
is that I am bewildered and astonished by his statements, but
am not convinced, though, on the whole, it seems to me pro-
bable that Archebiosis is true. I am not convinced, partly
I think owing to the deductive cast of much of his reasoning ;
and I know not why, but I never feel convinced by deduction,
even in the case of H. Spencers writings. If Dr. Bastians
book had been turned upside down, and he had begun with
the various cases of Heterogenesis, and then gone on to
organic, and afterwards to saline solutions, and had then given
his general arguments, I should have been, I believe, much
more influenced. I suspect, however, that my chief difficulty
is the effect of old convictions being stereotyped on my brain.
I must have more evidence that germs, or the minutest frag-
ments of the lowest forms, are always killed by 212 of Fahr.
Perhaps the mere reiteration of the statements given by
Dr. Bastian [of] other men, whose judgment I respect, and who
have worked long on the lower organisms, would suffice to
convince me. Here is a fine confession of intellectual weak-
ness ; but what an inexplicable frame of mind is that of
belief 1
As for Rotifers and Tardigrades being spontaneously gener-
* ' The Beginnings of Life. H. Generation. For the distinction
C. Bastian, 1872. between Archebiosis and Hetero-
t That is to say, Spontaneous genesis, see Bastian, chapter vi.
1872.] 'BEGINNINGS OF LIFE. 169
ated, my mind can no more digest such statements, whether
true or false, than my stomach can digest a lump of lead.
Dr. Bastian is always comparing Archebiosis, as well as
growth, to crystallisation ; but, on this view, a Rotifer or Tardi-
grade is adapted to its humble conditions of life by a happy
accident, and this I cannot believe. . . . He must have
worked with very impure materials in some cases, as plenty
of organisms appeared in a saline solution not containing an
atom of nitrogen.
I wholly disagree with Dr. Bastian about many points in
his latter chapters. Thus the frequency of generalised forms
in the older strata seems to me clearly to indicate the common
descent with divergence of more recent forms. Notwith-
standing all his sneers, I do not strike my colours as yet about
Fangenesis. I should like to live to see Archebiosis proved
true, for it would be a discovery of transcendent importance ;
or, if false, I should like to see it disproved, and the facts
otherwise explained ; but I shall not live to see all this. If
ever proved, Dr. Bastian will have taken a prominent part in
the work. How grand is the onward rush of science; it is
enough to console us for the many errors which we have com-
mitted, and for our efforts being overlaid and forgotten in the
mass of new facts and new views which are daily turning up.
This is all I have to say about Dr. Bastians book, and it
certainly has not been worth saying. . . .

Down, December n, 1872.
My DEAR Sir  I began reading your new book * sooner
than I intended, and when I once began, I could not stop ;
and now you must allow me to thank you for the very great
pleasure which it has given me. I have hardly ever read

anything more original and interesting than your treatment
of the causes which favour the development of scientific men.
The whole was quite new to me, and most curious. When
I began your essay I was afraid that you were going to attack
the principle of inheritance in relation to mind, but I soon
found myself fully content to follow you and accept your
limitations. I have felt, of course, special interest in the
latter part of your work, but there was here less novelty to
me. In many parts you do me much honour, and every-
where more than justice. Authors generally like to hear what
points most strike different readers, so I will mention that of
your shorter essays, that on the future prevalence of lan-
guages, and on vaccination interested me the most, as, indeed,
did that on statistics, and free will. Great liability to certain
diseases, being probably liable to atavism, is quite a new idea
to me. At p. 322 you suggest that a young swallow ought to
be separated, and then let loose in order to test the power
of instinct ; but nature annually performs this experiment,
as old cuckoos migrate in England some weeks before the
young birds of the same year. By the way, I have just used
the forbidden word nature," which, after reading your
essay, I almost determined never to use again. There
are very few remarks in your book to which I demur, but
when you back up Asa Gray in saying that all instincts are
congenital habits, I must protest.
Finally, will you permit me to ask you a question : have
you yourself, or [has] some one who can be quite trusted,
observed (p. 322) that the butterflies on the Alps are tamer
than those on the lowlands ? Do they belong to the same
species? Has this fact been observed with more than one
species ? Are they brightly coloured kinds ? I am especially
curious about their alighting on the brightly coloured parts
of ladies dresses, more especially because I have been more
than once assured that butterflies like bright colours, for
instance, in India the scarlet leaves of Fointsettia.

The following passage in a letter to Haeckel serves to show
that he had felt the writing of this book as a somewhat
severe strain :

it is published in November I will of course send you a copy,

in November. Two thousand were printed at the end of the
year, and this proved a misfortune, as they did not afterwards
sell so rapidly, and thus a mass of notes collected by the
author was never employed for a second edition during his
lifetime.

author the restless curiosity of the child to know the what

never to have abated its force.

could not be distinguished from one formed during subsidence.
I can, however, hardly believe in the former presence of as
many banks (there having been no subsidence) as there are
atolls in the great oceans, within a reasonable depth, on which
minute oceanic organisms could have accumulated to the thick-
ness of many hundred feet. . . . Pray forgive me for troubling
you at such length, but it has occurred [to me] that you
might be disposed to give, after your wide experience, your
judgment. If I am wrong, the sooner I am knocked on the
head and annihilated so much the better. It still seems to
me a marvellous thing that there should not have been much,
and long continued, subsidence in the beds of the great
oceans. I wish that some doubly rich millionaire would take
it into his head to have borings made in some of the Pacific
and Indian atolls, and bring home cores for slicing from a
depth of 500 or 600 feet. . . .
[The second edition of the  Descent of Man  was published
in the autumn of 1874 Some severe remarks on the
monistic hypothesis" appeared in the July* number of
the  Quarterly Review 1 (p. 45). The reviewer expresses his
astonishment at the ignorance of certain elementary dis-
tinctions and principles (eg. with regard to the verbum
mentale) exhibited, among others, by Mr. Darwin, who docs
not exhibit the faintest indication of having grasped them,
yet a clear perception of them, and a direct and detailed
examination of his facts with regard to them, was a sine qui
non for attempting, with a chance of success, the solution of
the mystery as to the descent of man.
Some further criticisms of a later date may be here alluded
to. In the Academy, 1876 (pp. 562, 587), appeared a review
of Mr. Mivarts Lessons from Nature, by Mr. Wallace.

When considering the part of Mr. Mivarts book relating to
Natural and Sexual Selection, Mr. Wallace says: In his
violent attack on Mr. Darwins theories our author uses
unusually strong language. Not content with mere argu-
ment, he expresses  reprobation of Mr. Darwins views  ; and
asserts that though he (Mr. Darwin) has been obliged,
virtually, to give up his theory, it is still maintained by
Darwinians with  unscrupulous audacity, and the actual
repudiation of it concealed by the  conspiracy of silence.
Mr. Wallace goes on to show that these charges are without
foundation, and points out that,  If there is one thing more
than another for which Mr. Darwin is pre-eminent among
modern literary and scientific men, it is for his perfect literary
honesty, his self-abnegation in confessing himself wrong, and
the eager haste with which he proclaims and even magnifies
small errors in his works, for the most part discovered by
himself.
CTTXTHR The following extract from a letter to Mr. Wallace (June
17th) refers to Mr. Mivarts statement (Lessons from Nature,
p. 144) that Mr. Darwin at first studiously disguised his views
as to the  bestiality of man  :
" I have only just heard of and procured your two articles
in the Academy. I thank you most cordially for your
generous defence of me against Mr. Mivart. In the  Origin
I did not discuss the derivation of any one species ; but that
I might not be accused of concealing my opinion, I went out
of my way, and inserted a sentence which seemed to me (and
still so seems) to disclose plainly my belief. This was quoted
in my  Descent of Man. Therefore it is very unjust ... of
Mr. Mivart to accuse me of base fraudulent concealment

My dear Miss Buckley, You must let me have the
pleasure of saying that I have just finished reading with very
great interest your new book.f The idea seems to me a
capital one, and as far as I can judge very well carried out.
There is much fascination in taking a birds eye view of all
the grand leading steps in the progress of science. At first I
regretted that you had not kept each science more separate ;
but I dare say you found it impossible. I have hardly any
criticisms, except that I think you ought to have introduced
Murchison as a great classifier of formations, second only to
W. Smith. You have done full justice, and not more than
justice, to our dear old master, Lyell. Perhaps a little more
ought to have been said about botany, and if you should ever
add this, you would find Sachs' 1 History, lately published,
very good for your purpose.
You have crowned Wallace and myself with much honour
and glory. I heartily congratulate you on having produced
so novel and interesting a work, and remain,
My dear Miss Buckley, yours very faithfully,

the slightest degree and your letter has interested me ex-
ceedingly. I will go through your points seriatim, but I have
never attended much to the history of any subject, and my

SIR JOSEPH HOOKERS ADDRESS.
247
l88l.]
Your idea, to show what travellers have done, seems to me
a brilliant and just one, especially considering your audience.
1. I know nothing about Toumeforts works.
2. I believe that you are fully right in calling Humboldt
the greatest scientific traveller who ever lived. I have lately
read two or three volumes again. His Geology is funny stuff ;
but that merely means that he was not in advance of his age.
I should say he was wonderful, more for his near approach to
omniscience than for originality. Whether or not his position
as a scientific man is as eminent as we think, you might truly
call him the parent of a grand progeny of scientific travellers,
who, taken together, have done much for science.
3. It seems to me quite just to give Lyell (and secondarily
E. Forbes) a very prominent place.
4 Dana was, I believe, the first man who maintained the
permanence of continents and the great oceans. . . . When I
read the 'Challengers' conclusion that sediment from the
land is not deposited at greater distances than 200 to 300
miles from the land, I was much strengthened in my old
belief. Wallace seems to me to have argued the case ex-
cellently. Nevertheless, I would speak, if I were in your place,
rather cautiously ; for T. Mellard Reade has argued lately
with some force against the view ; but I cannot call to mind his
arguments. If forced to express a judgment, I should abide
by the view of approximate permanence since Cambrian days.
5. The extreme importance of the Arctic fossil plants, is
self-evident Take the opportunity of groaning over [our]
ignorance of the Lignite Plants of Kerguelen Land, or any
Antarctic land. It might do good.
6. I cannot avoid feeling sceptical about the travelling of
plants from the North except during the Tertiary period. It
may of course have been so and probably was so from one
of the two poles at the earliest period, during Pre-Cambrian
ages; but such speculations seem to me hardly scientific,
seeing how little we know of the old Floras.
248 miscellanea  ( continued ). [1881.
I will now jot down without any order a few miscellaneous
remarks.
I think you ought to allude to Alph. De Candolles great
book, for though it (like almost everything else) is washed out
of my mind, yet I remember most distinctly thinking it a
very valuable work. Anyhow, you might allude to his
excellent account of the history of all cultivated plants.
How shall you manage to allude to your New Zealand and
Tierra del Fuego work ? if you do not allude to them you
will be scandalously unjust.
The many Angiosperm plants in the Cretacean beds of the
United States (and as far as I can judge the age of these
beds has been fairly well made out) seems to me a fact of
very great importance, so is their relation to the existing flora
of the United States under an Evolutionary point of view.
Have not some Australian extinct forms been lately found in
Australia ? or have I dreamed it ?
Again, the recent discovery of plants rather low down in
our Silurian beds is very important.
Nothing is more extraordinary in the history of the Vege-
table Kingdom, as it seems to me, than the apparently very
sudden or abrupt development of the higher plants. I have
sometimes speculated whether there did not exist somewhere
during long ages an extremely isolated continent, perhaps
near the South Pole.
Hence I was greatly interested by a view which Saporta
propounded to me, a few years ago, at great length in MS.
and which I fancy he has since published, as I urged him to
do  viz., that as soon as flower-frequenting insects were
developed, during the latter part of the secondary period, an
enormous impulse was given to the development of the higher
plants by cross-fertilization being thus suddenly formed.
A few years ago I was much struck with Axel Blytts*

navia, that there had apparently been long periods with more
rain and other with less rain (perhaps connected with Crolls
recurrent astronomical periods), and that these periods had
largely determined the present distribution of the plants of
Norway and Sweden. This seemed to me a very important
I have just read over my remarks and I fear that they will
not be of the slightest use to you.
I cannot but think that you have got through the hardest,
or at least the most difficult, part of your work in having made
so good and striking a sketch of what you intend to say ;
but I can quite understand how you must groan over the
great necessary labour.
I most heartily sympathise with you on the successes of
B. and R. : as years advance what happens to oneself
becomes of very little consequence, in comparison with the
careers of our children.
Keep your spirits up, for I am convinced that you will
make an excellent address.
Ever yours affectionately,
Charles Darwin.
[In September he wrote :
I have this minute finished reading your splendid but
too short address. I cannot doubt that it will have been
fully appreciated by the Geographers at York ; if not, they
are asses and fools.]
CTTXTHR Lindley, the Editor. My father wrote to Sir Joseph (Nov. 12,
1862) :
So you did write the review in the Gardeners' Chronicle.
Once or twice I doubted whether it was Lindley ; but when
I came to a little slap at R. Brown, I doubted no longer.
You arch-rogue ! I do not wonder you have deceived others
also. Perhaps I am a conceited dog; but if so, you have
much to answer for; I never received so much praise, and
coming from you I value it much more than from any other.
With regard to botanical opinion generally, he wrote to
Dr. Gray,  I am fairly astonished at the success of my book
with botanists. Among naturalists who were not botanists,
Lyell was pre-eminent in his appreciation of the book. I have
no means of knowing when he read it, but in later life, as
I learn from Professor Judd, he was enthusiastic in praise of
the 1 Fertilisation of Orchids, which he considered  next to
the Origin, as the most valuable of all Darwins works.
Among the general public the author did not at first hear
of many disciples, thus he wrote to his cousin Fox, in
September 1862 :  Hardly any one not a botapisf^^pept;
yourself, as far as I know, has cared for it." >

FERTILISATION
[1862.
A favourable notice appeared in the Saturday Review,
October 1 8th, 1 862 ; the reviewer points out that the book would
escape the angry polemics aroused by the  Origin. * This is
illustrated by a review in the Literary Churchman, in which
only one fault is found, namely, that Mr. Darwins expression
of admiration at the contrivances in orchids is too indirect a
way of saying,  O Lord, how manifold are Thy works I
A somewhat similar criticism occurs in the Edinburgh
Review  (October 1 862). The writer points out that Mr. Darwin
constantly uses phrases, such as beautiful contrivance, the
labellum is . . . in order to attract,  the nectar is purposely
lodged." The Reviewer concludes his discussion thus: We
know, too, that these purposes and ideas are not our own,
but the ideas and purposes of Another.
The  Edinburgh  reviewers treatment of his subject was
criticised in the Saturday Review, November 15th, 1862. With
reference to this article my father wrote to Sir Joseph Hooker
(December 29th, 1862) :
 Here is an odd chance ; my nephew Henry Parker, an
Oxford Classic, and Fellow of Oriel, came here this evening;
and I asked him whether he knew who had written the little
article in the Saturday, smashing the [Edinburgh reviewer],
which we liked ; and after a little hesitation he owned he
had. I never knew that he wrote in the Saturday ; and was
it not an odd chance ?
The  Edinburgh  article was written by the Duke of
Argyll, and has since been made use of in his * Reign of Law,
1867. Mr. Wallace replied f to the Dukes criticisms, making
some especially good remarks on those which refer to orchids.
He shows how, by a  beautiful self-acting adjustment, the
nectary of the orchid Angraecum (from 10 to 14 inches in

length), and the proboscis of a moth sufficiently long to reach
the nectar, might be developed by natural selection. He goes
on to point out that on any other theory we must suppose
that the flower was created with an enormously long nectary,
and that then by a special act, an insect was created fitted to
visit the flower, which would otherwise remain sterile. With re-
gard to this point my father wrote (October 12 or 13, 1867) :
 I forgot to remark how capitally you turn the tables on
the Duke, when you make him create the Angraecum and
Moth by special creation.
If we examine the literature relating to the fertilisation of
flowers, we do not find that this new branch of study showed
any great activity immediately after the publication of the
Orchid-book. There are a few papers by Asa Gray, in 1862
and 1863, by Hildebrand in 1864, and by Moggridge in 1865,
but the great mass of work by Axell, Delpino, Hildebrand,
and the Mullers, did not begin to appear until about 1867.
The period during which the new views were being assimi-
lated, and before they became thoroughly fruitful, was, how-
ever, surprisingly short. The later activity in this depart-
ment may be roughly gauged by the fact that the valuable
'Bibliography, given by Prof. DArcy Thompson in his
translation of Mullers * Befruchtung  (1883), contains refer-
ences to 814 papers.
Besides the book on Orchids, my father wrote two or three
papers on the subject, which will be found mentioned in the
Appendix. The earliest of these, on the three sexual forms
of Catasetum, was published in 1862 ; it is an anticipation
of part of the Orchid-book, and was merely published in the
Linncan Societys Journal, in acknowledgment of the use
made of a specimen in the Societys possession. The possi-
bility of apparently distinct species being merely sexual forms
of a single species, suggested a characteristic experiment,
which is alluded to in the following letter to one of his earliest
disciples in the study of the fertilisation of flowers :]

FERTILISATION
[1865.
CTTXTHR In July, 1881, he wrote to Mr. Wallace, We have just
returned home after spending five weeks on Ullswater ; the
scenery is quite charming, but I cannot walk, and everything
tires me, even seeing scenery .... What I shall do with my
few remaining years of life I can hardly tell. I have every-
thing to make me happy and contented, but life has become
very wearisome to me. He was, however, able to do a good
deal of work, and that of a trying sort,* during the autumn
of 1881, but towards the end of the year he was clearly in
need of rest ; and during the winter was in a lower condition
than was usual with him.
On December 13, he went for a week to his daughter's
house in Bryanston Street. During his stay in London he
went to call on Mr. Romanes, and was seized when on the
door-step with an attack apparently of the same kind as those
which afterwards became so frequent. The rest of the in-
cident, which I give in Mr. Romanes words, is interesting too
from a different point of view, as giving one more illustration
of my fathers scrupulous consideration for others :
* On the action of carbonate of ammonia on roots and leaves.
CONCLUSION.

1882.]
 I happened to be out, but my butler, observing that Mr.
Darwin was ill, asked him to come in. He said he would
prefer going home, and although the butler urged him to
wait at least until a cab could be fetched, he said he would
rather not give so much trouble. For the same reason he
refused to allow the butler to accompany him. Accordingly
he watched him walking with difficulty towards the direction
in which cabs were to be met with, and saw that, when he
had got about three hundred yards from the house, he stag-
gered and caught hold of the park-railings as if to prevent
himself from falling. The butler therefore hastened to his
assistance, but after a few seconds saw him turn round with
the evident purpose of retracing his steps to my house. How-
ever, after he had returned part of the way he seems to
have felt better, for he again changed his mind, and proceeded
to find a cab.
During the last week of February and in the. beginning of
March, attacks of pain in the region of the heart, with irre-
gularity of the pulse, became frequent, coming on indeed
nearly every afternoon. A seizure of this sort occurred about
March 7, when he was walking alone at a short distance from
the house ; he got home with difficulty, and this was the
last time that he was able to reach his favourite Sand-
walk. Shortly after this, his illness became obviously more
serious and alarming, and he was seen by Sir Andrew Clark,
whose treatment was continued by Dr. Norman Moore, of St
Bartholomews Hospital, and Mr. Allfrey, of St. Mary Cray.
He suffered from distressing sensations of exhaustion and
faintness, and seemed to recognise with deep depression the
fact that his working days were over. He gradually recovered
from this condition, and became more cheerful and hopeful, as
is shown in the following letter to Mr. Huxley, who was
anxious that my father should have closer medical supervision
than the existing arrangements allowed :

Down, March 27, 1882.
 My DEAR Huxley,  Your most kind letter has been a real
cordial to me. I have felt better to-day than for three weeks,
and have felt as yet no pain. Your plan seems an excellent
one, and I will probably act upon it, unless I get very much
better. Dr. Clarks kindness is unbounded to me, but he is
too busy to come here. Once again, accept my cordial
thanks, my dear old friend. I wish to God there were more

I close the record of my father's life with a few words of
retrospect added to the manuscript of his Autobiography
 As for myself, I believe that I have acted rightly in steadily
following and devoting my life to Science. I feel no remorse
from having committed any great sin, but have o ten an
often regretted that I have not done more direct good to my
