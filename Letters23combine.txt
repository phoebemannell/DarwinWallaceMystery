CHAPTER I. 

THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE ‘ORIGIN OF SPECIES.’ 

[In the first volume, p. 82, the growth of the ‘ Origin of Species ’ 
has been briefly described in my father’s words. The letters 
given in the present and following chapters will illustrate and 
amplify the history thus sketched out. 

It is clear that, in the early part of the voyage of the Beagle 
he did not feel it inconsistent with his views to express him- 
self in thoroughly orthodox language as to the genesis of new 
species. Thus in 1834 he wrote* at Valparaiso: “I have 
already found beds of recent shells yet retaining their colour 
at an elevation of 1300 feet, and beneath the level country is 
strewn with them. It seems not a very improbable conjecture 
that the want of animals may be owing to none having been 
created since this country was raised from the sea.” 

This pcissage does not occur in the published ‘Journal,’ the 
last proof of which was finished in 1837 ; and this fact har- 
monizes with the change we know to have been proceeding in 
his views. But in the published ‘Journal ’ we find passages 
which show a point of view more in accordance with orthodox 

* MS. Journals, p. 468.

theological natural history than with his later views. Thus, 
in speaking of the birds Synallaxis and Scytalopus (ist edit 
p. 3S3 ; 2nd edit p. 289), he says: “When finding, as in 
this case, any animal which seems to play so insignificant 
a part in the great scheme of nature, one is apt to wonder 
why a distinct species should have been created.” 

A comparison of the two editions of the ‘Journal’ is in- 
structive, as giving some idea of the development of his 
views on evolution. It does not give us a true index of 
the mass of conjecture which was taking shape in his mind, 
but it shows us that he felt sure enough of the truth of his 
belief to allow a stronger tinge of evolution to appear in 
the second edition. He has mentioned in the Autobiography 
(p. 83), that it was not until he read Malthus that he got a 
clear view of the potency of natural selection. This was in 
1838 — a year after he finished the first edition (it was not 
published until 1839), and seven years before the second edition 
was written (1845). Thus the turning-point in the formation 
of his theory took place between the writing of the two 
editions. 

I will first give a few passages which are practically the 
same in the two editions, and which are, therefore, chiefly of 
interest as illustrating his frame of mind in 1837. 

The case of the two species of Molothrus (ist edit. p. 61 ; 
2nd edit p. S 3 ) must have been one of the earliest instances 
noticed by him of the existence of representative species — 
a phenomenon which we know (‘Autobiography,’ p. 83) struck 
him deeply. The discussion on introduced animals (ist edit 
p. 139; 2nd edit p. l2o) shows how much he was impressed 
by the complicated interdependence of the inhabitants of a 

An analogous point of view is given in the discussion 
(1st edit p. 98 ; 2nd edit p. 85) of the mistaken belief that 
large animals require, for their support, a luxuriant vegeta- 
tion ; the incorrectness of this view is illustrated by the com-

parison of the fauna of South Africa and South America, and 
the vegetation of the two continents. The interest of the 
discussion is that it shows clearly our i priori ignorance of 
the conditions of life suitable to any organism. 

There is a passage which has been more than once quoted 
as bearing on the origin of his views. It is where he dis» 
cusses the striking difference between the species of mice on 
the east and west of the Andes (ist edit p. 399) : “ Unless we 
suppose the same species to have been created in two 
different countries, we ought not to expect any closer simi- 
larity between the organic beings on the opposite sides of 
the Andes than on shores separated by a broad strait of the 
sea.” In the 2nd edit p. 327, the passage is almost verbally 
identical, and is practically the same. 

There are other passages again which are more strongly 
evolutionary in the 2nd edit, but otherwise are similar to the 
corresponding passages in the 1st edition. Thus, in describing 
the blind Tuco-tuco (ist edit. p. 60 ; 2nd edit. p. 52), in the 
first edition he makes no allusion to what Lamarck might 
have thought, nor is the instance used as an example of 
modification, as in the edition of 1845. 

A striking passage occurs in the 2nd edit (p. 173) on the 
relationship between the “extinct edentata and the living 
sloths, ant-eaters, and armadillos.” 

“ This wonderful relationship in the same continent between 
the dead and the living, will, I do not doubt, hereafter throw 
more light on the appearance of organic beings on our earth, 
and their disappearance from it, than any other class of facts.” 
This sentence does not occur in the 1st edit, but he was 
evidently profoundly struck by the disappearance of the 
gigantic forerunners of the present animals. The difference 
between the discussions in the two editions is most instructive. 
In both, our ignorance of the conditions of life is insisted on, 
but in the second edition, the discussion is made to lead up to 
a strong statement of the intensity of the struggle for life.

Then follows a comparison behveen rarity • and extinction, 
which introduces the idea that the preservation and dominance 
of existing species depend on the degree in which they are 
adapted to surrounding conditions. In the first edition, he is 
merely “ tempted to believe in such simple relations as varia- 
tion of climate and food, or introduction of enemies, or the 
increased number of other species, as the .cause of the succes- 
sion of races.” But finally (1st edit.) he ends the chapter by 
comparing the extinction of a species to the exhaustion and 
disappearance of varieties of fruit-trees, as though he thought 
that a mysterious term of life was impressed on each species 
at its creation. 

The difference of treatment of the Galapagos problem is of 
some interest In the earlier book, the American type of the 
productions of the islands is noticed, as is the fact that the 
different islands possess forms specially their own, but the 
importance of the whole problem is not so strongly put 
forward. Thus, in the first edition, he merely says : — 

"This similarity of type between distant islands and con- 
tinents, while the species are distinct, has scarcely been 
sufficiently noticed. The circumstance would be explained, 
according to the views of some authors, by saying that the 
creative power had acted according to the same law over a 
wide area.” — (ist edit. p. 474.) 

This passage is not given in the second edition, and the 
generalisations on geographical distribution are much wider 
and fuller. Thus he asks : — 

" Why were their aboriginal inhabitants, associated ... in 
different proportions both in kind and number from those 
on the Continent, and therefore acting on each other in a 
different manner — why were they created on American types 
of organisation ?” — (2nd edit. p. 393-) 

• In the second edition, p. 146, of our ignorance of the causes of 
the destruction of Niata cattle by rarity or extinction. The passage 
droughts is given as a good example does not occur in the first edition.

NOTE-BOOK OF 1837. 



The same difference of treatment is shown elsewhere in this 
chapter. Thus the gradation in the form of beak presented 
by the thirteen allied species of finch is described in the first 
edition (p. 461) without comment. Whereas in the second 
edition (p. 380) he concludes : — 

“ One might really fancy that from an original paucity of 
birds in this Archipelago, one species has been taken and 
modified for different ends.” 

On the whole it seems to me remarkable that the difference 
between the two editions is not greater ; it is another proof of 
the author’s caution and self-restraint in the treatment of his 
theory. After reading the second edition of the ‘ Journal,’ we 
find with a strong sense of surprise how far developed were 
his views in 1837. We are enabled to form an opinion on 
this point from the note-books in which he wrote down 
detached thoughts and queries. I shall quote from the first 
note-book, completed between July 1837 and February 
1 838 : and this is the more worth doing, as it gives us an 
insight into the condition of his thoughts before the reading 
of Malthus. The notes are written in his most hurried style, 
so many words being omitted, that it is often difficult to 
arrive at the meaning. With a few exceptions (indicated by 
square brackets)* I have printed the extracts as written ; the 
punctuation, however, has been altered, and a few obvious 
slips corrected where it seemed necessary. The extracts arc 
not printed in order, but are roughly classified.f

extinct, which is law, almost proved.”

when we can hardly believe necessary, but if it was necessary 
to one forefather, the result would be as it is. Hence ante- 
lopes at Cape of Good Hope ; marsupials at Australia.” 

" Countries longest separated greatest differences — if sepa- 
rated from immersage, possibly two distinct types, but each, 
having its representatives — as in Australia.” 

"Will this apply to whole ot^anic kingdom when our planet 
first cooled ? " 

The two following extracts show that he applied the theory 
of evolution to the "whole organic kingdom” from plants to 

" If we choose to let conjecture run wild, then animals, our 
fellow brethren in pain, disease, death, suffering and famine — 
our slaves in the most laborious works, our companions in 
our amusements — they may partake [of?] our origin in one 
common ancestor — we may be all melted together.” 

"The different intellects of man and animals not so great 
as between living things without thought (plants), and living 
things with thought (animals).” 

The following extracts are again concerned with an d priori 
view of the probability of the origin of species by descent — 
" propagation,” as he called it. 

" The tree of life should perhaps be called the coral of life, 
base of branches dead ; so that passages cannot be seen.” 

“ There never may have been grade between pig and tapir, 
yet from some common progenitor. Now if the intermediate 
ranks had produced infinite species, probably the scries would 
have been more perfect.” 

At another place, speaking of intermediate forms, he says 
" Cuvier objects to propagation of species by saying, why 
have not some intermediate forms been discovered between 
Palaeotherium, Megalonyx, Mastodon, and the species now 
living ? Now according to my view (in S. America) parent of 
all Armadilloes might be brother to Megatherium — uncle 
now dead.”

NOTE-BOOK OF 1837.

Speaking elsewhere of intermediate forms, he remarks : — 

“ Opponents will say — show them me. I will answer yes, if 
you will show me every step between bulldog and grey- 
hound.” 

Here we see that the case of domestic animals was already 
present in his mind as bearing on the production of natural 
species. The disappearance of intermediate forms naturally 
leads up to the subject of extinction, with which the next 
extract begins. 

“ It is a wonderful fact, horse, elephant, and mastodon, 
dying out about same time in such different quarters. 

“Will Mr. Lyell say that some [same?] circumstance killed 
it over a tract from Spain to South America? — (Never.) 

“ They die, without they change, like golden pippins ; it is 
3. generation of species like generation of individuals. 

“Why does individual die.’ To perpetuate certain peculi- 
arities (therefore adaptation), and obliterate accidental varieties, 
and to accommodate itself to change (for, of course, change, 
even in varieties, is accommodation). Now this argument 
applies to species. 

“If individual cannot propagate he has no issue — so with 

“ If species generate other species, their race is not utterly cut 
off : — like golden pippins, if produced by seed, go on — other- 
wise all die. 

“The fossil horse generated, in South Africa, zebra — and 
continued — perished in America. 

“ All animals of same species are bound together just like 
buds of plants, which die at one time, though produced either 
sooner or later. Prove animals like plants — trace gradation 
between associated and non-associated animals — and the story 
will be complete.” 

Here we have the view already alluded to of a term of life 
impressed on a species. 

But in the following note we get extinction connected with

8 THE FOUSDATIOKS OF THE ‘ORIGIN OF SPECIES.’ 



unfavourable variation, and thus a hint is given of natural 
selection : — 

“ With respect to extinction, we can easily see that [a] 
variety of [the] ostrich (Petise), may not be well adapted, 
and thus perish out ; or, on the other hand, like Orpheus [a 
Galapagos bird], being favourable, many might be produced. 
This requires [the] principle that the permanent variations 
produced by confined breeding and changing circumstances 
arc continued and produce[d] according io the adaptation of 
such circumstances, and therefore that death of species is a 
consequence (contrary to what would appear from America) 
of non-adaptation of circumstances.” 

The first part of the next extract has a similar bearing. 
The end of the passage is of much interest, as showing that 
he had at this early date visions of the far-reaching character 
of his speculations : — 

“ With belief of transmutation and geographical grouping, 
we are led to endeavour to discover causes of change ; the 
manner of adaptation (wish of parents ? ?), instinct and struc- 
ture becomes full of speculation and lines of observation. 
View of generation being condensation,* test of highest or- 
ganisation intelligible .... My theory would give zest to 
recent and fossil comparative anatomy ; it would lead to the 
study of instincts, heredity, and mind-heredity, whole [of] 
metaphysics. 

" It would lead to closest examination of hybridity, regener- 
ation, causes of change in order to know what we have come 
from and to what we tend — to what circumstances favour 
crossing and what prevents it — this, and direct examination 
of direct passages of structure in species, might lead to laws 
of change, which would then be the main object of study, to 
guide our speculations.” 

The following two extracts have a similar interest ; the

second is especially interesting, as it contains the germ of 
the concluding sentence of the ‘ Origin of Species ’ : * — 

“ Before the attraction of gravity discovered it might have 
been said it was as great a difficulty to account for the 
movement of all [planets] by one law, as to account for each 
separate one ; so to say that all mammalia were born from 
one stock, and since distributed by such means as we can 
recognise, may be thought to explain nothing. 

“Astronomers might formerly have said that God fore- 
ordered each planet to move in its particular destiny. In the 
same manner God orders each animal created with certain 
forms in certain countries ; but how much more simple and 
sublime [a] power — let attraction act according to certain 
law, such arc inevitable consequences — let animals be created, 
then by the fixed laws of generation, such will be their 
successors. 

" Let the powers of transportal be such, and so will be the 
forms of one country to another — let geological changes go at 
such a rate, so will be the number and distribution of the 
species ! ! ” 

The three next extracts are of miscellaneous interest : — 

" When one sees nipple on man’s breast, one does not say 
some use, but sex not having been determined — so with useless 
wings under elytra of beetles — born from beetles with wings, 
and modified — if simple creation merely, would have been 
bom without them."

(for otherwise the relationship would converge sooner), and 
lastly, perhaps, some one single one. Will not this account

for the odd genera with few species which stand between 
great groups, which we are bound to consider the increasing 

The last extract which I shall quote gives the germ of his 
theory of the relation between alpine plants in various parts 
of the world, in the publication of which he was forestalled 
by E. Forbes (see Vol. I. p. 88). He says, in the 1837 note- 
book, that alpine plants, “ formerly descended lower, therefore 
[they are] species of lower genera altered, or northern plants.” 

When we turn to the Sketch of his theory, written in 1844 
(still therefore before the second edition of the ‘Journal’ 
was completed), we find an enormous advance made on the 
note-book of 1837. The Sketch is in fact a surprisingly com- 
plete presentation of the argument afterwards familiar to us 
in the ‘ Origin of Species.’ There is some obscurity as to the 
date of the short Sketch which formed the basis of the 1844 
Essay. We know from his own words (Vol. I. p. 184), that it 
was in June 1842 that he first wrote out a short sketch of 
his views.* This statement is given with so much circum- 
stance that it is almost Impossible to suppose that it contains 
an error of date. It agrees also with the followng extract 
from his Diary. 

“ 1842. May 1 8th. Went to Maer. 

‘‘June 15th to Shrewsbury, and on i8th to Capel Curig. 
During my stay at Maer and Shrewsbury (five years after 
commencement) wrote pencil-sketch of species theory.” 

Again in the introduction to the ‘ Origin,’ p. i, he writes, 
“after an interval of five years’ work,” [from 1837, i.e. in 1842,] 
“ I allowed myself to speculate on the subject, and drew up

of Species to form Varieties,’ * the essay of 1844 (extracts 
from which form part of the paper) is said to have been 
“sketched in 1839, and copied in 1844.” This statement is 
obviously made on the authority of a note written in my 
father’s hand across the Table of Contents of the 1844 Essay. 
It is to the following effect : “This was sketched in 1839, and 
copied out in full, as here written and read by you in 1844.” 

I conclude that this note was added in 1858, when the MS. 
was sent to Sir J. D. Hooker (see Letter of June 29, 1858, 
Vol. II. p. 1 19). There is also some further evidence on this side 
of the question. Writing to Mr. Wallace (Jan. 25, 1859) my 
father says : — “ Every one whom I have seen has thought 
your paper very well written and interesting. It puts my 
extracts (written in 1839, now just twenty years ago !), which 
I must say in apology were never for an instant intended for 
publication, into the shade.” The statement that the earliest 
sketch was written in 1839 has been frequently made in 
biographical notices of my father, no doubt on the authority 
of the ‘ Linnean Journal,’ but it must, I think, be considered 
as erroneous. The error may possibly have arisen in this 
way. In writing on the Table of Contents of the 1844 MS. 
that it was sketched in 1839, I think my father may have 
intended to imply that the framework of the theory was clearly 
thought out by him at that date. In the Autobiography 
(p. 88) he speaks of the time, “ about 1839, when the theory 
was clearly conceived,” meaning, no doubt, the end of 1838 
and beginning of 1839, when the reading of Malthus had 
given him the key to the idea of natural selection. But this 
explanation does not apply to the letter to Mr. Wallace ; and 
with regard to the passage t in the 'Linnean Journal’ it is 
difficult to understand how it should have been allowed to

12 THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE ‘ORIGIN OF SPECIES.’ 

remain as it now stands, conveying, as it clearly does, the 
impression that 1839 was the date of his earliest written sketch. 

The sketch of 1844 is written in a clerk’s hand, in two 
hundred and thirty-one pages folio, blank leaves being 
alternated with the MS. with a view to amplification. The 
text has been revised and corrected, criticisms being pencilled 
by himself on the margin. It is divided into two parts : I. “ On 
the variation of Organic Beings under Domestication and in 
their Natural State.” II. “On the Evidence favourable and 
opposed to the view that Species are naturally formed races 
descended from common Stocks.” The first part contains the 
main argument of the ‘ Origin of Species.’ It is founded, as is 
the argument of that work, on the study of domestic animals, 
and both the Sketch and the ‘ Origin ’ open with a chapter 
on variation under domestication and on artificial selection. 
This is followed, in both essays, by discussions on variation 
under nature, on natural selection, and on the struggle for 
life. Here, any close resemblance between the two essays 
with regard to arrangement ceases. Chapter III. of the 
Sketch, which concludes the first part, treats of the varia- 
tions which occur in the instincts and habits of animals, 
and thus corresponds to some extent with Chapter VII. of 
the ‘Origin’ (ist edit.). It thus forms a complement to 
the chapters which deal with variation in structure. It seems 
to have been placed thus early in the Essay to prevent the 
hasty rejection of the whole theory by a reader to whom 
the idea of natural selection acting on instincts might seem 
impossible. This is the more probable, as the Chapter on 
Instinct in the ‘ Origin ’ is specially mentioned (Introduction, 
p. 5) as one of the “ most apparent and gravest difficulties on 
the theory.” Moreover the chapter in the Sketch ends with 
a discussion, “whether any particular corporeal structures 

are so wonderful as to justify the rejection //-»>«(} facie 

of our theory.” Under this heading comes the discussion of 
the eye, which in the ‘ Origin ’ finds its place in Chapter VI.

SKETCH OF 1844.

under " Difficulties on Theory.” The second part seems to 
have been planned in accordance with his favourite point of 
view with regard to his theory. This is briefly given in a 
letter to Dr. Asa Gray, November nth, 1859: “I cannot 
possibly believe that a false theory would explain so many 
classes of facts, as I think it certainly does explain. On these 
grounds I drop my anchor, and believe that the difficulties 
will slowly disappear.” On this principle, having stated the 
theory in the first part, he proceeds to show to what extent 
various wide series of facts can be explained by its means. 

Thus the second part of the Sketch corresponds roughly 
to the nine concluding Chapters of the First Edition of the 
‘Origin.’ But we must exclude Chapter VII. (‘Origin’) on 
Instinct, which forms a chapter in the first part of the Sketch, 
and Chapter VIII. (‘Origin’) on Hybridism, a subject treated 
in the Sketch with ‘Variation under Nature ’ in the first part. 

The following list of the chapters of the second part of the 
Sketch will illustrate their correspondence with the final 
chapters of the ‘ Origin.’ 

Chapter I. “On the kind of intermediateness necessary, 
and the number of such intermediate forms.” 

This includes a geological discussion, and corresponds to 
parts of Chapters VI. and IX. of the ‘ Origin.’ 

Chapter II. “ The gradual appearance and disappearance 
of organic beings.” Corresponds to Chapter X. of the 

Chapter III. “ Geographical Distribution.” Corresponds to 
Chapters XI. and XII. of the ‘ Origin.’ 

Chapter IV. “ Affinities and Classification of Organic 
beings.” 

Chapter V. “ Unity of Type,” Morphology, Embryology. 

Chapter VI. Rudimentary Organs. 

These three chapters correspond to Chapter XII. of the 

Chapter VII. Recapitulation and Conclusion. The final

sentence of tlie Sketch, which we saw in its first rough 
form in the Note Book of 1837, closely resembles the final 
sentence of the ‘ Origin,’ much of it being identical. The 
‘ Origin ’ is not divided into two " Parts,” but we see traces of 
such a division having been present in the writer’s mind, in 
this resemblance between the second part of the Sketch and 
the final chapters of the ‘ Origin.’ That he should speak * of 
the chapters on transition, on instinct, on hybridism, and 
on the geological record, as forming a group, may be due to 
the division of his early MS. into two parts. 

Mr. Huxley, who was good enough to read the Sketch at 
my request, while remarking that the “ main lines of argu- 
ment” and the illustrations employed are the same, points 
out that in the 1844 Essay, “ much more weight is attached to 
the influence of external conditions in producing variation^ 
and to the inheritance of acquired habits than in the 
‘ Origin.’ ” 

It is extremely interesting to find in the Sketch the first 
mention of principles familiar to us in the ‘ Origin of Species.’ 
Foremost among these may be mentioned the principle of 
Sexual Selection, which is clearly enunciated. The important 
form of selection known as “ unconscious,” is also given. 
Here also occurs a statement of the law that peculiarities 
tend to appear in the offspring at an age corresponding to 
that at which they occurred in the parent 

Professor Newton, who was so kind as to look through the 
1844 Sketch, tells me that my father’s remarks on the migra- 
tion of birds, incidentally given in more than one passage, 
show that he had anticipated the views of some later writers. 

With regard to the general style of the Sketch, it is not 
to-be expected that it should have all the characteristics of 
the ‘Origin,’ and we do not, in fact, find that balance and 
control, that concentration and grasp, which are so striking 
in the work of 1859.

PRINCIPLE OF DIVERGENCE. 



In the Autobiography (Vol. I. p. 84) my father has stated 
what seemed to him the chief flaw of the 1844 Sketch; he 
had overlooked “one problem of great importance,” the 
problem of the divergence of character. This point is dis- 
cussed in the ‘ Origin of Species,’ but, as it may not be familiar 
to all readers, I will give a short account of the difficulty and 
its solution. The author begins by stating that varieties 
differ from each other less than species, and then goes on : 
“ Nevertheless, according to my view, varieties are species in 
process of formation How then does the lesser dif- 

ference between varieties become augmented into the greater 
difference between species.” * He shows how an analogous 
divergence takes place under domestication where an originally 
uniform stock of horses has been split up into race-horses, 
dray-horses, &c., and then goes on to explain how the same 
principle applies to natural species. “From the simple 
circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from 
any one species become in structure, constitution, and habits, 
by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and 
widely diversified places in the polity of nature, and so be 
enabled to increase in numbers.” 

The principle is exemplified by the fact that if on one plot 
of ground a single variety of wheat be sown, and on to 
another a mixture of varieties, in the latter case the produce 
is greater. More individuals have been able to exist because 
they were not all of the same variety. An organism becomes 
more perfect and more fitted to survive when by division 
of labour the different functions of life are performed by 
different organs. In the same way a species becomes more 
efficient and more able to survive when different sections of 
the species become differentiated so as to fiil different stations. 

In reading the Sketch of 1844, I have found it difficult to 
recognise, as a flaw in the Essay, the absence of any definite 
statement of the principle of divergence. Descent with

modification implies divergence, and we become so habituated 
to a belief in descent, and therefore in divergence, that we 
do not notice the absence of proof that divergence is in itself 
an advantage. As shown in the Autobiography, my father 
in 1876 found it hardly credible that he should have over- 
looked the problem and its solution. 

The following letter will be more in place here than its 
chronological position, since it shows what was my father’s 
feeling as to the value of the Sketch at the time of its 
completion.] 

C. Darwin to Mrs. Darwin. 

Dovm, July 5, 1844. 

... I have just finished my sketch of my species theory. 
If, as I believe, my theory in time be accepted even by 
one competent judge, it will be a considerable step in science. 

I therefore write this in case of my sudden death, as my 
most solemn and last request, which I am sure you will con- 
sider the same as if legally entered in my will, that you will 
devote £ 400 to its publication, and further, will yourself, or 
through Hensleigh,* take trouble in promoting it I wish 
that my sketch be given to some competent person, with this 
sum to induce him to take trouble in its improvement and 
enlargement I give to him all my books on Natural History, 
which are either scored or have references at the end to the 
pages, begging him carefully to look over and consider such 
passages as actually bearing, or by possibility bearing, on 
this subject. I wish you to make a list of all such books as 
some temptation to an editor. I also request that you will 
hand over [to] him all those scraps roughly divided in eight 
or ten brown paper portfolios. The scraps, with copied 
quotations from various works, are those which may aid my 
editor. I also request that you, or some amanuensis, will aid

in deciphering any of the scraps which the editor may think 
possibly of use. I leave to the editor’s judgment whether to 
interpolate these facts in the text, or as notes, or under 
appendices. As the looking over the references and scraps 
will be a long labour, and as the correcting and enlarging and 
altering my sketch will also take considerable time, 1 leave 
this sum ofj£'400 as some remuneration, and any profits from 
the work. I consider that for this the editor is bound to get 
the sketch published either at a publisher's or his own risk. 
Many of the scraps in the portfolios contain mere rude sugges- 
tions and early views, now useless, and many of the facts will 
probably turn out as having no bearing on my theory. 

With respect to editors, Mr. Lyell would be the best if he 
would undertake it ; I believe he would find the work pleasant, 
and he would learn some facts new to him. As the editor must 
be a geologist as well as a naturalist, the next best editor would 
be Professor Forbes of London. The next best (and quite 
best in many respects) would be Professor Henslow. Dr. 
Hooker would be very good. The next, Mr. Strickland.* If 
none of these would undertake it, I would request you to 
consult with Mr. Lyell, or some other capable man for some 
editor, a geologist and naturalist Should one other hundred 
pounds make the difference of procuring a good editor, I 
request earnestly that you will raise 500. 

My remaining collections in Natural History may be given 
to any one or any museum where [they] would be accepted. . . . 

[The following note seems to have formed part of the 
original letter, but may have been of later date : 

“ Lyell, especially with the aid of Hooker (and if any good 
zoological aid), would be best of all. Without an editor will

“ If there should be any difficulty in getting an editor who 
would go thoroughly into the subject, and think of the bearing 
of the passages marked in the books and copied out of scraps 
of paper, then let my sketch be published as it is, stating 
that it was done several years ago • and from memory without 
consulting any works, and with no intention of publication in 
its present form." 

The idea that the Sketch of 1844 might remain, in the 
event of his death, as the only record of his work, seems to 
have been long in his mind, for in August 1854, when he had 
finished mth the Cirripedes, and was thinking of beginning 
his " species work," he added on the back of the above letter, 
“ Hooker by far best man to edit my species volume. August 
1854”]

later date. 



CHAPTER II. 



THE GROWTH OF THE ‘ORIGIN OF SPECIES. 

LETTERS, 1843-1856. 

[The history of my father’s life is told more completely in 
his correspondence with Sir J. D. Hooker than in any other 
series of letters ; and this is especially true of the history 
of the growth of the ‘Origin of Species.’ This, therefore, 
seems an appropriate place for the following notes, which 
Sir Joseph Hooker has kindly given me. They give, more- 
over, an interesting picture of his early friendship with my 
father : — 

“My first meeting with Mr. Darwin was in 1839, in 
Trafalgar Square. I was walking with an officer who 
had been his shipmate for a short time in the Beagle seven 
years before, but who had not, I believe, since met him. 
I was introduced ; the interview was of course brief, and the 
memory of him that I carried away and still retain was that 
of a rather tall and rather broad-shouldered man, with 
a slight stoop, an agreeable and animated expression when 
talking, beetle brows, and a hollow but mellow voice ; and 
tliat his greeting of his old acquaintance was sailor-like — 
that is, delightfully frank and cordial. I observed him well, 
for I was already aware of his attainments and labours, derived 
from having read various proof-sheets of his then unpublished 
‘ Journal.’ These had been submitted to Mr. (afterwards Sir. 
Charles) Lyell by Mr. Danvin, and by him sent to his father, 
Ch. Lyell, Esq., of Kinnordy, who (being a very old friend of 
my father, and taking a kind interest in my projected career 
as a naturalist) had allowed me to peruse them. At this time 



GROWTH OF THE ‘ORIGIN.’ 



[1843. 

I was hurrying on my studies, so as to take my degree before 
volunteering to accompany Sir James Ross in the Antarctic 
Expedition, which had just been determined on by the 
Admiralty ; and so pressed for time was I, that I used to 
sleep with the sheets of the ‘Journal’ under my pillow, that 
1 might read them behveen waking and rising. They im- 
pressed me profoundly, I might say despairingly, with the 
variety of acquirements, mental and physical, required in 
a naturalist who should follow in Darwin’s footsteps, whilst 
they stimulated me to enthusiasm in the desire to travel 
and observe. 

" It has been a permanent source of happiness to me that 
I knew so much of Mr. Danvin’s scientific work so many 
years before that intimacy began which ripened into feelings 
as near to those of reverence for his life, works, and cha- 
racter cis is reasonable and proper. It only remains to add 
to this little episode that I received a copy of the ‘Journal’ 
complete, — a gift from Mr. Lyell, — a few days before leaving 
England. 

“ Very soon after the return of the Antarctic Expedition 
my correspondence with Mr. Darwin began (December, 1843) 
by his sending me a long letter, warmly congratulating 
me on my return to my family and friends, and expressing 
a wish to hear more of the results of the expedition, of which 
he had derived some knowledge from private letters of my 
own (written to or communicated through Mr. Lyell). Then, 
plunging at once into scientific matters, he directed my atten- 
tion to the importance of correlating the Fuegian Flora with 
that of the Cordillera and of Europe, and invited me to study 
the botanical collections which he had made in the Galapagos 
Islands, as well as his Patagonian and Fuegian plants. 

“ This led to me sending him an outline of the conclusions 
I had formed regarding the distribution of plants in the 
southern regions, and the necessity of assuming the destruc- 
tion of considerable areas of land to account fot 'the relations

of the flora of the so-called Antarctic Islands. I do not 
suppose that any of these ideas were new to him, but they 
led to an animated and lengthy correspondence full of 
instruction." 

Here follows the letter (1843) to Sir J. D. Hooker above 
referred to.] 

My dear Sir, — I had hoped before this time to have had 
the pleasure of seeing you and congratulating you on your 
safe return from your long and glorious voyage. But as I 
seldom go to London, we may not yet meet for some time — 
.without you are led to attend the Geological meetings. 

I am anxious to know what you intend doing with all your 
materials — I had so much pleas^re in reading parts of some 
of your letters, that I shall be very sorry if I, as one of the 
public, have no opportunity of reading a good deal more. 
I suppose you are very busy now and full of enjoyment; 
how well I remember the happiness of my first few months 
of England — it was worth all the discomforts of many a gale 1 
But I have run from the subject, which made me write, of 
expressing my pleasure that Henslow (as he informed me 
a few days since by letter) has sent to you my small collec- 
tion of plants. You cannot think how much pleased I am, 
as I feared they would have been all lost, and few as they arc, 
they cost me a good deal of trouble. There are a very few 
notes, which I believe Henslow has got, describing the 
habitats, &c., of some few of the more remarkable plants. 
I paid particular attention to the Alpine flowers of Tierra del 
Fuego, and I am sure I got every plant which was in flower 
in Patagonia at the seasons when we were there. I have long 
thought that some general sketch of the Flora of the point of 
land, stretching so far into the southern seas, would be very 
curious. Do make comparative remarks on the species allied 
to the European species, for the advantage of botanical 
ignoramuses like myself. It has often struck me as a curious

point to find out, whether there are many European genera 
in T. del Fuego which are not found along the ridge of the 
Cordillera; the separation in such case would be so enor- 
mous. Do point out in any sketch you draw up, what 
genera are American and what European, and how great 
the differences of the species are, when the genera are 
European, for the sake of the ignoramuses. 

I hope Henslow will send you my Galapagos plants (about 
which Humboldt even expressed to me considerable curiosity) 
— I took much pains in collecting all I could. A Flora of this 
archipelago would, I suspect, offer a nearly parallel case to 
that of St. Helena, which has so long excited interest. 
Pray excuse this long rambling note, and believe me, my 
dear sir, yours verj- sincerely, 

C. Darwin. 

Will you be so good as to present my respectful com- 
pliments to Sir W. Hooker. 

[Referring to Sir J. D. Hooker’s work on the Galapagos 
Flora, my father wrote in 1846: 

“ I cannot tell you how delighted and astonished I am at 
the results of your examination ; how wonderfully they 
support my assertion on the differences in the animals of the 
different islands, about which I have always been fearful.” 

Again he wrote (1849) ; — 

“ I received a few weeks ago your Galapagos papers,* and 
I have read them since being here. I really cannot express 
too strongly my admiration of the geographical discussion : 
to my judgment it is a perfect model of what such a paper 
should be ; it took me four days to read and think over. 
How interesting the Flora of the Sandwich Islands appears 
to be, how I wish there were materials for you to treat its

flora as you have done the Galapagos. In the Systematic 
paper I was rather disappointed in not finding general 
remarks on affinities, structures, &c., such as you often give 
in conversation, and such as De Candolle and St Hilaire 
introduced in almost all their papers, and which make them 
interesting even to a non-Botanist.” 

“ Very soon aftenvards [continues Sir J. D. Hooker] in a 
letter dated January 1844, the subject of the ‘Origin of 
Species ’ was brought fonvard by him, and I believe that I 
was the first to whom he communicated his then new ideas 
on the subject, and which being of interest as a contribution 
to the history of Evolution, I here copy from his letter ” : — ] 

C. Darwin to J, D. Hooker. 

[January nth, 1844.] 

. . . Besides a general interest about the southern lands, I 
have been now ever since my return engaged in a very pre- 
sumptuous work, and I know no one individual who would 
not say a very foolish one. I was so struck with the distri- 
bution of the Galapagos organisms, &c. &c., and with the 
character of the American fossil mammifers, &c. &c., that I 
determined to collect blindly every sort of fact, which could 
bear any way on what are species. I have read heaps of 
agricultural and horticultural books, and have never ceased 
collecting facts. At last gleams of light have come, and I am 
almost convinced (quite contrary to the opinion I started 
with) that species are not (it is like confessing a murder) 
immutable. Heaven forfend me from Lamarck nonsense of 
a “ tendency to progression,” “ adaptations from the slow 
willing of animals,” Sic. ! But the conclusions I am led to are 
not widely different from his ; though the means of change 
are wholly so. I think I have found out (here’s presump- 
tion!) the simple way by which species become exquisitely 
adapted to various ends. You will now groan, and think to

yourself, “on what a man have I been wasting my time 
and writing to." I should, five years ago, have thought 

[The following letter written on February 23, 1S44, shows 
that the acquaintanceship with Sir J. D. Hooker was then 
fast ripening into friendship. The letter is chiefly of interest 
as showing the sort of problems then occupying my father’s 
mind :] 

Dear Hooker, — I hope you will excuse the freedom of my 
address, but I feel that as co-circum-wanderers and as fellow 
labourers (though myself a very weak one) we may throw 
aside some of the old-world formality. ... I have just finished 
a little volume on the volcanic islands which we visited. I 
do not know how far you care for dry simple geology, but I 
hope you will let me send you a copy. I suppose I can send 
it from London by common coach conveyance. 

... I am going to ask you some more questions, though 1 
dare say, without asking them, I shall see answers in your 
work, when published, which will be quite time enough for 
my purposes. First for the Galapagos, you will see in my 
Journal, that the Birds, though peculiar species, have a most 
obvious S. American aspect : I have just ascertained the 
same thing holds good with the sea-shells. Is it so with 
those plants which are peculiar to this archipelago ; you state 
that their numerical proportions are continental (is not this a 
very curious fact?) but are they related in forms to S. 
America. Do you know of any other case of an archipelago, 
with the separate islands possessing distinct representative 
species ? I have always intended (but have not yet done so) 
to examine Webb and Berthelot on the Canary Islands for 
this object. Talking with Mr. Bentham, he told me that the 
separate islands of the Sandwich Archipelago possessed 
distinct representative species of the same genera of Labiatae : 
would not this be worth your enquiry? How is it with the

GALAPAGOS FLORA. 



25 



Azores ; to be sure the heavy western gales would tend to 
diffuse the same species over that group. 

I hope you will (I dare say my hope is quite superfluous) 
attend to this general kind of affinity in isolated islands, 
though I suppose it is more difficult to perceive this sort of 
relation in plants, than in birds or quadrupeds, the groups of 
which are, I fancy, rather more confined. Can St. Helena 
be classed, though remotely, either with Africa or S. America ? 
From some facts, which I have collected, I have been led to 
conclude that the fauna of mountains are either remarkably 
siinilar (sometimes in the presence of the same species and at 
other times of same genera), or that they are remarkably 
dissimilar ; and it has occurred to me that possibly part of 
this peculiarity of the St Helena and Galapagos floras may 
be attributed to a great part of these two Floras being 
mountain Floras. I fear my notes will hardly serve to dis- 
tinguish much of the habitats of the Galapagos plants, but 
they may in some cases ; most, if not all, of the green, leafy 
plants come from the summits of the islands, and the thin 
brown leafless plants come from the lower arid parts : would 
you be so kind as to bear this remark in mind, when ex- 
amining my collection. 

1 will trouble you with only one other question. In dis- 
cussion with Mr. Gould, I found that in most of the genera 
of birds which range over the whole or greater part of the 
world, the individual species have wider ranges, thus the Owl 
is mundane, and many of the species have very wide ranges. 
So I believe it is with land and fresh-water shells — and I 
might adduce other cases. Is it not so with Cryptogamic 
plants ; have not most of the species wide ranges, in those 
genera which are mundane ? I do not suppose that the 
converse holds, viz. — that when a species has a wide range, 
its genus also ranges wide. Will you so far oblige me by 
occasionally thinking over this? It would cost me vast 
trouble to get a list of mundane phanerogamic genera and

26 GROWTH OF THE ‘ORIGIN.’ [1844. 

then search how far the species of these genera are apt to 
range wide in their several countries ; but you might occa- 
sionally, in the course of your pursuits, just bear this in mind, 
though perhaps the point may long since have occurred to 
you or other Botanists, Geology is bringing to light interest- 
ing facts, concerning the ranges of shells ; I think it is pretty 
well established, that according as the geographical range of 
a species is wide, so is its persistence and duration in time. 
I hope you will try to grudge as little as you can the trouble 
of my letters, and pray believe me very truly yours, 

C. Darwin. 

P.S. I should feel extremely obliged for your kind offer of 
the sketch of Humboldt ; I venerate him, and after having had 
the pleasure of conversing with him in London, I shall still 
more like to have any portrait of him. 

[What follows is quoted from Sir J. D. Hooker’s notes. 

" The next act in the drama of our lives opens with personal 
intercourse. This began with an invitation to breakfast with 
him at his brother’s (Erasmus Darwin’s) house in Park Street ; 
which was shortly afterwards followed by an invitation to 
Down to meet a few brother Naturalists. In the short 
intervals of good health that followed the long illnesses which 
oftentimes rendered life a burthen to him, between 1844 apd 
1847, I had many such invitations, and delightful they were. 
A more hospitable and more attractive home under every 
point of view could not be imagined— of Society there were 
most often Dr. Falconer, Edward Forbes, Professor Bell, and 
Mr. Waterhouse — there were long walks, romps with the 
children on hands and knees, music that haunts me still.

enjoyment of home life with friends ; strolls with him all

always left with the feeling that I had imparted nothing and 
carried away more than I could stagger under. Latterly, as 
his health became more seriously affected, I was for days and 
weeks the only visitor, bringing my work with me and 
enjoying his society as opportunity offered. It was .an 
established rule that he every day pumped me, as he called 
it, for half an hour or so after breakfast in his study, when 
he first brought out a heap of slips with questions botanical, 
geographical, &c., for me to answer, and concluded by telling 
me of the progress he had made in his own work, asking my 
opinion on various points. I saw no more of him till about 
noon, when I heard his mellow ringing voice calling my 
name under my window — this was to join him in his daily 
forenoon walk round the sand-tvalk.* On joining him I 
found him in a rough grey shooting-coat in summer, and 
thick cape over his shoulders in winter, and a stout staff in 
his hand ; away we trudged through the garden, where there 
was always some experiment to visit, and on to the sand- 
walk, round which a fixed number of turns were taken, during 
which our conversation usually ran on foreign lands and seas, 
old friends, old books, and things far off to both mind and 

“In the afternoon there was another such walk, after which 
he again retired till dinner if well enough to join the family ; 
if not, he generally managed to appear in the drawing-room, 
where seated in his high chair, with his feet in enormous 
carpet shoes, supported on a high stool — he enjoyed the 
music or conversation of his family.’’ 

Here follows a series of letters illustrating the growth 
of my father’s views, and the nature of his work during this 
period.]

GROWTH OF THE ‘ORIGIN.’ 



[1844. 



C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down [1844]. 

, . . The conclusion, which I have come at is, that those 
areas, in which species are most numerous, have oftenest 
been divided and isolated from other areas, united and again 
divided ; a process implying antiquity and some changes in 
the external conditions. This will justly sound very hypo- 
thetical. I cannot give my reasons in detail ; but the most 
general conclusion, which the geographical distribution of all 
organic beings, appears to me to indicate, is that isolation is 
the chief .concomitant or cause of the appearance of 7iew 
forms (I well know there are some staring exceptions). 
Secondly, from seeing how often the plants and animals 
swarm in a country, when introduced into it, and from see- 
ing what] a vast number of plants will live, for instance in 
England, if kept free from weeds, and native plants, I have 
been led to consider that the spreading and number of the 
organic beings of' any country depend less on its external 
features, than on the number of forms, which have been there 
originally created or produced. I much doubt whether you 
will find it possible to explain the number of forms by pro- 
portional differences of exposure ; and I cannot doubt if 
half the species in any country were destroyed or had not 
been created, yet that country would appear to us fully 
peopled. With respect to original creation or production of 
new forms, I have said that isolation appears the chief ele- 
ment. Hence, with respect to terrestrial productions, a tract 
of country, which had oftenest within the late geological pe- 
riods subsided and been converted into islands, and reunited, 
I should expect to contain most forms. 

But such speculations are amusing only to one’s self, and in 
this case useless, as they do not show any direct line of obser- 
vation : if I had seen how hypothetical [is] the little, which I

Down, 1844. 

i . . I forget my last letter, but it must have been a very 
silly one, as it seems I gave my notion of the number of 
species being in great degree governed by the degree to 
which the area had been often isolated and divided ; I must 
have been cracked to have written it, for I have no evidence, 
without a person be willing to admit all my views, and then 
it does follow ; but in my most sanguine moments, all I 
expect, is that 1 shall be able to show even to sound Natur- 
alists, that there are two sides to the question of the immut- 
ability of species; — that facts can be viewed and grouped 
under the notion of allied species having descended from 
common stocks. With respect to books on this subject, I 
do not know of any systematical ones, except Lamarck’s,- 
which is veritable rubbish ; but there are plenty, as Lyell, 
Pritchard, &c., on the view of the immutability. Agassiz 
lately has brought the strongest argument in favour of immut- 
ability. Isidore Hilaire has written some good Essays, 

tending towards the mutability-side, in the ‘ Suites k Buffon,’ 
entitled “ Zoolog. G6n6ralc.” Is it not strange that the author 
of such a book as the ‘ Animaux sans Vertibres ’ should 
have written that insects, which never see their eggs, should 
win (and plants, their seeds) to be of particular forms, so as 
to become attached to particular objects. The other common 
(specially Germanic) notion is hardly less absurd, viz. that 
climate, food, &c., should make a Pediculus formed to climb 
hair, or wood-pecker to climb trees. I believe all these 
absurd views arise from no one having, as far as I know, 
approached the subject on the side of variation under domest-

ication, and having studied all that is known about domestic- 
ation. I was very glad to hear your criticism on island-floras 
and on non-diflusion of plants : the subject is too long for a 
letter: I could defend myself to some considerable extent, 
but I doubt whether successfully in your eyes, or indeed in 
my own. . . . 

C. Darwin to y. D. Hooker. 

Down, [July, 1844.] 

... I am now reading a wonderful book for facts on 
variation — Bronn, ‘Geschichte der Natur.’ It is stiff" German : 
it forestalls me, sometimes I think delightfully, and some- 
times cruelly. You will be ten times hereafter more horrified 
at me than at H. Watson. I hate arguments from results, 
but on my views of descent, really Natural History becomes 
a sublimely grand result-giving subject (now you may quiz 
me for so foolish an escape of mouth). ... I must leave this 
letter till to-morrow, for I am tired ; but I so enjoy writing 
to you, that I must inflict a little more on you. 

Have you any good evidence for absence of insects in small 
islands ? I found thirteen species in Keeling Atoll. Flies 
are good fertilizers, and I have seen a microscopic Thrips 
and a Cecidomya take flight from a flower in the direction 
of another with pollen adhering to them. In Arctic countries 
a bee seems to go as far N. as any flower

My dear Hooker, — I write a line to say that Cosmos * 
arrived quite safely (N.B. One sheet came loose in Ft I.), and 
to thank you for your nice note. I have just begun the intro- 
duction, and groan over the style, which in such parts is full 
half the battle. How true many of the remarks are {i.e. as

MUTABILITY OF SPECIES. 



I wish I ever had any books to lend you in return for the 
many you have lent me. ... 

All of what you kindly say about my species work does 
not alter one iota my long self-acknowledged ■ presumption 
in accumulating facts and speculating on the subject of 
variation, without having worked out my due share of species. 
But now for nine years it has been anyhow the greatest 
amusement to me. 

Farewell, my dear Hooker, I grieve more than you can 
well believe, over our prospect of so seldom meeting. 

I have never perceived but one fault in you, and that you 
have grievously, viz. modesty ; you form an exception to 
Sydney Smith’s aphorism, that merit and modesty have no 
other connection, except in their first letter. Farewell, 

C. Darwin. 

C. Darwin to L. Jenyns {Blomefield). 

Down, Oct. I2th [1845]. 

My dear Jenyns, — Thanks for your note. I am sorry to 
say I have not even the tail-end of a fact in English Zoology 
to communicate. I have found that even trifling observations 
require, in my case, some leisure and energy, both of which 
ingredients I have had none to spare, as writing my Geology 
thoroughly expends both. I had always thought that I 
would keep a journal and record everything, but in the way 
I now live I find I observe nothing to record. Looking after 
my garden and trees, and occasionally a very little walk in 
an idle frame of my mind, fills up every afternoon in the 
same manner. I am surprised that with all your parish 
affairs, you have had time to do all that which you have 
done. I shall be very glad to see your little work* (and

proud should I have been if I could have added a single fact 
to it). My work on the species- question has impressed me 
very forcibly with the importance of all such works as your 
intended one, containing what people are pleased generally 
to call trifling facts. These are the facts which make one 
understand the working or economy of nature. There is one 
subject, on which I am very curious, and which perhaps you 
may throw some light on, if you have ever thought on it ; 
namely, what are the checks and what the periods of life, — 
by which the increase of any given species is limited. Just 
calculate the increase of any bird, if you assume that only 
half the young are reared, and these breed : within the natural 
{i.e. if free from accidents) life of the parents the number of 
individuals will become enormous, and I have been much 
surprised to think how great destruction must annually or 
occasionally be falling on every species, yet the means and 
period of such destruction is scarcely perceived by us. 

I have continued steadily reading and collecting facts on 
variation of domestic animals and plants, and on the question 
of what are species. I have a grand body of facts, and I 
think I can draw some sound conclusions. The general con- 
clusions at which I have slowly been driven from $ directly 
opposite conviction, is that species are mutable, and that 
allied species are co-descendants from common stocks. I 
know how much I open myself to reproach for such a con- 
clusion, but I have at least honestly and deliberately come to 
it I shall not publish on this subject for several years. At 
present I am on the Geology of South America. I hope to 
pick up from your book some facts on slight variations in 
structure or instincts in the animals of your acquaintance. 

Believe me, ever yours, 

C. Darwin.

STRUGGLE FOR LIFE. 



33 



C. Darwin to L. Jenyus.* 

Down, [1845 ?]. 

My dear Jenyns, — I am very much obliged to you for 
the trouble you have taken in having written me so long 
a note. The question of where, when, and how the check 
to the increase of a given species falls appears to me par 
ticularly interesting, and our difficulty in answering it shows 
how really ignorant we are of the lives and habits of our most 
familiar species. I was aware of the bare fact of old birds 
driving away their young, but had never thought of the effect 
you so clearly point out, of local gaps in number being thus 
immediately filled up. But the original difficulty remains ; for 
if your farmers had not killed your sparrows and rooks, what 
would have become of those which now immigrate into your 
parish ? in the middle of England one is too far distant from 
the natural limits of the rook and sparrow to suppose that 
the young are thus far expelled from Cambridgeshire. The 
check must fall heavily at some time of each species’ life ; 
for, if one calculates that only half the progeny are reared 
and bred, how enormous is the increase 1 One has, however, 
no business to feel so much surprise at one’s ignorance, when 
one knows how impossible it is without statistics to con- 
jecture the duration of life and percentage of deaths to births 
in mankind. If it could be shown that apparently the birds 
of passage which breed here and increase, return in the suc- 
ceeding years in about the same number, whereas those that 
come here for their winter and non-breeding season annually, 
come here with the same numbers, but return with greatly 
decreased numbers, one would know (as indeed seems 
probable) that the check fell chiefly on full-grown birds 
in the winter season, and not on the eggs and very young 
birds, which has appeared to me often the most probable 
period. If at any time any remarks on this subject should

occur to you, I should be most grateful for the benefit of 

With respect to my far distant work on species, I must 
have expressed myself with singular inaccuracy if I led you 
to suppose that I meant to say that my conclusions were 
inevitable. They have become so, after years of weighing 
puzzles, to myself alone; but in my wildest day-dream, I 
never expect more than to be able to show that there are 
two sides to the question of the immutability of species, 
i.e. whether species are directly created or by intermediate 
laws (as with the life and death of individuals). 1 did not 
approach the subject on the side of the difficulty in deter- 
mining what are species and what are varieties, but (though 
why I should give you such a history of my doings it would 
be hard to say) from such facts as the relationship between 
the living and extinct mammifers in South America, and 
between those living on the Continent and on adjoining 
islands, such as the Galapagos. It occurred to me that 
a collection of all such analogous facts would throw light 
either for or against the view of related species being co- 
descendants from a common stock. A long searching 
amongst agricultural and horticultural books and people 
makes me believe (I well know how absurdly presumptuous 
this must appear) that I see the way in which new varieties 
become exquisitely adapted to the external conditions of life 
and to other surrounding beings. I am a bold man to lay 
myself open to being thought a complete fool, and a most 
deliberate one. From the nature of the grounds which make 
me believe that species are mutable in form, these grounds 
cannot be restricted to the closest-allied species ; but how far 
they extend I cannot tell, as my reasons fall away by degrees, 
when applied to species more and more remote from each 
other. Pray do not think that I am so blind as not to see 
that there are numerous immense difficulties in my notions, 
but they appear to me less than on the common view. I have

C. Danuiu to L. Jenym. 

Down, Oct. 17th, 1846. 

Dear Jenyns, — I have taken a most ungrateful length 
of time in thanking you for your very kind present of 
your ‘ Observations.’ But I happened to have had in hand 
several other books, and have finished yours only a few days 
ago. I found it very pleasant reading, and many of your 
facts interested me much. I think I wa^ more interested, 
which is odd, with your notes on some of the lower animals 
than on the higher ones. The introduction struck me as very 
good ; but this is what I expected, for I well remember being 
quite delighted with a preliminary essay to the first number 
of the ‘ Annals of Natural History.’ I missed one discussion, 
and think myself ill-used, for I remember your saying you 
would make some remarks on the weather and barometer, 
as a guide for the ignorant in prediction. I had also hoped 
to have perhaps met with some remarks on the amount of 
variation in our common species. Andrew Smith once 
declared he would get some hundreds of specimens of larks 
and sparrows from all parts of Great Britain, and see whether, 
with finest measurements, he could detect any proportional 
variations in beaks or limbs, &c This point interests me 
from having lately been skimming over the absurdly opposite 
conclusions of Gloger and Brehm ; the one making half-a- 
dozen species out of every common bird, and the other

turning so many reputed species into one. Have you ever 
done anything of this kind, or have you ever studied Gloger’s 
or Brehm’s works ? I was interested in your account of the 
martins, for I had just before been utterly perplexed by 
noticing just such a proceeding as you describe : I counted 
seven, one day lately, visiting a single nest and sticking dirt 
on the adjoining wall. I may mention that I once saw some 
squirrels eagerly splitting those little semi-transparent 
spherical galls on the back of oak-leaves for the maggot 
within ; so that they are insectivorous. A Cychrus rostratus 
once squirted into-my eyes and gave me e.Ntreme pain ; and 
I must tell you what happened to me on the banks of the 
Cam, in my early entomological days : under a piece of 
bark I found two Carabi (I forget which), and caught one in 
each hand, when lo and behold I saw a sacred Panageeus crux 
major ! I could not bear to give up either of my Carabi, and 
to lose PatMgteus was out of the question ; so that in despair 
I gently seized one of the Carabi between my teeth, when to 
my unspeakable disgust and pain the little inconsiderate 
beast squirted his acid down my throat, and I lost both Carabi 
and PanagcBus ! I was quite astonished to hear of a terres- 
trial Planaria ; for about a year or two ago I described in the 
‘Annals of Natural History’ several beautifully coloured 
terrestrial species of the Southern Hemisphere, and thought it 
quite a new fact. By the way, you speak of a sheep with a 
broken leg not having flukes : I have heard my father aver 
that a fever, or any serious accident, as a broken limb, will 
cause in a man all the intestinal worms to be evacuated. 
Might not this possibly have been the case with the flukes in 
their early state ? 

I hope you were none the worse for Southampton ; * I wish 
I had seen you looking rather fatter. I enjoyed my week 
extremely, and it did me good. I missed you the last few 
days, and we never managed to see much of each other ; but

for your kind present, and the pleasure it has given me, and 
believe me.

P.S. — I have quite forgotten to say how greatly interested I 
was with your discussion on the statistics of animals : when 
will Natural History be so perfect that such points as you 
discuss will be perfectly known about any one animal ? 

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Malvern, June 13 [1849]. 

... At last I am going to press with a small poor 
first-fruit of my confounded Cirripedia, viz. the fossil ped- 
unculate cirripedia. You ask what effect studying species 
has had on my variation theories ; I do not think much — I 
have felt some difficulties more. On the other hand, I have 
been struck (and probably unfairly from the class) with the 
variability of every part in some slight degree of every 
species. When the same organ is rigorously compared in 
many individuals, I always find some slight variability, and 
consequently that the diagnosis of species from minute 
differences is always dangerous. I had thought the same 
parts of the same species more resemble (than they do 
anyhow in Cirripedia) objects cast in the same mould. 
Systematic work would be easy were it not for this con- 
founded variation, which, however, is pleasant to me as 
a spcculatist, though odious to me as a systematist. Your 
remarks on the distinctness (so unpleasant to me) of the 
Himalayan Rubi, willows, &c., compared with those of 
northern [Europe ?], &c., are very interesting ; if my rude 
species-sketch had any small share in leading you to these

C. Danvin to J. D. Hooker. 



Down, Wednesday, [September, n. d.] 

. . . Many thanks for your letter received yesterday, which, 
as always, set me thinking : I laughed at your attack at my 
stinginess in changes of level towards Forbes,* being so 
liberal towards myself; but I must maintain, that I have 
never let down or upheaved our mother-earth’s surface, for 
the sake of explaining any one phenomenon, and I trust I 
have very seldom done so without some distinct evidence. 
So I must still think it a bold step (perhaps a very true one) 
to sink into the depths of ocean, within the period of existing 
species, so large a tract of surface. But there is no amount 
or extent of change of level, which I am not fully prepared 
to admit, but I must say I should like better evidence, than 
the identity of a few plants, which possibly (I do not say 
probably) might have been otherwise transported. Particular

Isle of Man 1815, diM 1854. His 
best known work was his Report 
on the distribution of marine 
animals at different depths in the 
Mediterranean. An important 
memoir of his is referred to in my 
father’s ‘Autobiography,’ p. 88. He 
held successively the posts of Cura- 
tor to the Geological Society’s 
Museum, and Professor of Natural 
History in the Museum of Practical

was appointed Professor of Natural 
History in the University of Edin- 
burgh. He seems to have im- 
pressed his contemporaries as a 
man of strikingly versatile and 
vigorous mind. The above allu- 
sion to changes of level refers to 
Forbes’s tendency to explain the 
facts of geographical distribution 
by means of an active geological 
imagination.

l8S3-] LAMARCK, THE ‘ VESTIGES.’ 39 

thanks for your attempt to get me a copy of ‘ L’Espfece,’ * and 
almost equal thanks for your criticisms on him : I rather 
misdoubted him, and felt not much inclined to take as gospel 
his facts. I find this one of my greatest difficulties with 
foreign authors, viz. judging of their credibility. How pain- 
fully (to me) true is your remark, that no one has hardly a 
right to e.xamine the question of species who has not minutely 
described many. I was, however, pleased to hear from Owen 
(who is vehemently opposed to any mutability in species), 
that he thought it was a very fair subject, and that there 
was a mass of facts to be brought to bear on the question, 
not hitherto collected. My only comfort is (as I mean to 
attempt the subject), that I have dabbled in several branches 
of Natural History, and seen good specific men work out my 
species, and know something of geology (an indispensable 
union) ; and though I shall get more kicks than half-pennies, 
I will, life serving, attempt my work. Lamarck is the only 
exception, that I can think of, of an accurate describer of 
species, at least in the Invertebrate Kingdom, who has dis- 
believed in permanent species, but he in his absurd though 
clever work has done the subject harm, as has Mr. Vestiges, 
and, as (some future loose naturalist attempting the same 
speculations will perhaps say) has Mr. D. . , .

GROWTH OF THE ‘ORIGIN.’ 



[1853- 



I really suspect there is something absolutely opposed to each 
other and hostile in the two frames of mind required for 
systematising and reasoning on large collections of facts. 
Many of your arguments appear to me very well put, and, 
as far as my experience goes, the candid way in which you 
discuss the subject is unique. The whole will be very useful 
to me whenever I undertake my volume, though parts take 
the wind very completely out of my sails ; it will be all nuts 
to me ... for I have for some time determined to give the 
arguments on both sides (as far as I could), instead of arguing 
on the mutability side alone. 

In my own Cirripedial work (by the way, thank you for 
the dose of soft solder ; it does one — or at least me — a great 
deal of good) — in my own work I have not felt conscious 
that disbelieving in the mere permanence of species has made 
much difference one way or the other ; in some few cases 
(if publishing avowedly on the doctrine of non-permanence), 
I should not have affixed names, and in some few cases 
should have affixed names to remarkable varieties. Certainly 
I have felt it humiliating, discussing and doubting, and 
examining over and over again, when in my own mind the 
only doubt has been whether the form varied to-day or 
yesterday (not to put too fine a point on it, as Snagsby • would 
say). After describing a set of forms as distinct species, tearing 
up my MS., and making them one species, tearing that up 
and making them separate, and then making them one 
again (which has happened to me), I have gnashed my 
teeth, cursed species, and asked what sin I had committed 
to be so punished. But I must confess that perhaps nearly 
the same thing would have happened to me on any scheme 
of work. 

I am heartily glad to hear your Journal f is so much 
advanced ; how magnificently it seems to be illustrated !

An ‘ Oriental Naturalist^ with lots of imagination and not 
too much regard to facts, is just the man to discuss species! 
I think your title of ‘A Journal of a Naturalist in the East’ 
very good ; but whether “ in the Himalaya ” would not be 
better, I have doubted, for the East sounds rather vague. . . . 



C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

[1853-] 

My dear Hooker, — I have no remarks at all worth 
sending you, nor, indeed, was it likely that I should, con- 
sidering how perfect and elaborated an essay it is.* As far 
as my judgment goes, it is the most important discussion 
on the points in question ever published. I can say no more. 
I agree with almost eveiything you say ; but I require much 
time to digest an essay of such quality. It almost made me 
gloomy, partly from feeling I could not answer some points 
which theoretically I should have liked to have been different, 
and partly from seeing so far better done than I could have 
done, discussions on some points which I had intended to 
have taken up. . . . 

I much enjoyed the slaps you have given to the provincial 
species-mongers. I wish I could have been of the slightest 
use : I have been deeply interested by the whole essay, and 
congratulate you on having produced a memoir which I 
believe will be memorable. I was deep in it when your 
most considerate note arrived, begging me not to hurry. I 
thank Mrs. Hooker and yourself most sincerely for your wish 
to see me. I will not let another summer pass without 
seeing you at Kew, for indeed I should enjoy it much. . . . 

You do me really more honour than I have any claim to,

My dear Hooker, — I had hoped that you would have 
had a little breathing-time after your Journal, but this seems 
to be very far from the case ; and I am the more obliged 
(and somewhat contrite) for the long letter received this 
morning, wwj; juicy with news and most interesting to me in 
many ways. I am very glad indeed to hear of the reforms, 
&c., in the Royal Society. With respect to the Club,* I am 
deeply interested ; only two or three days ago, I was regretting 
to my wife, how I was letting drop and being dropped by 
nearly all my acquaintances, and that I would endeavour to 
go oftener to London ; I was not then thinking of the Club, 
which, as far as any one thing goes, would answer my exact 
object in keeping up old and making some new acquaintances. 

I will therefore come up to London for every (with rare 
exceptions) Club-day, and then my head, I think, will allow [ 
me on an average to go to every other meeting. But it is

Professor Bonney is good enough 
to inform me) on April 34, 1854. He

The number of members being 
limited to 47, it was proposed to 
christen it “the Club of 47," but 
the name was never adopted. The

vating the various branches of

contributed to its progress ; to in-

several, in our small circle, reading it with very much pleasure. 
I shall be curious to hear what Humboldt will say : it will, I 
should think, delight him, and meet with more praise from 
him than any other book of Travels, for I cannot remember 
one, which has so many subjects in common with him. What 

a wonderful old fellow he is By the way, I hope, 

when you go to Hitcham.f towards the end of May, you will 
be forced to have some rest. I am grieved to hear that all 
the bad symptoms have not left Henslow ; it is so strange 
and new to feel any uneasiness about his health. I am 
particularly obliged to you for sending me Asa Gray’s letter ; 
how very pleasantly he writes. To see his and your caution 
on the species-question ought to overwhelm me in confusion 
and shame ; it does make me feel deuced uncomfortable. . . . 
It is delightful to hear all that he says on Agassiz : how very 
singular it is that so eminently clever a man, with such 
immense knowledge on many branches of Natural History, 
should write as he does. Lyell told me that he was so 
delighted with one of his (Agassiz’) lectures on progressive 
development, Stc. &c., that he went to him aftenvards and 
told him, “ that it was so delightful, that he could not help 
all the time wishing it was true.” I seldom see a Zoological 
paper from North America, without observing the impress of 
Agassiz’ doctrines, — another proof, by the way, of how great 
a man he is. I was pleased and surprised to see A. Gray’s 
remarks on crossing, obliterating varieties, on which, as you 
know, I have been collecting facts for these dozen years.

very curious point in the astounding proportion of Coleoptera 
that are apterous ; and I think I have guessed the reason, 
viz. that powers of flight would be injurious to insects inhab- 
iting a confined locality, and expose them to be blown to the 
sea ; to test this, I find that the insects inhabiting the Dezerte 
Grande, a quite small islet, would be still more exposed to 
this danger, and here the proportion of apterous insects is 
even considerably greater than on Madeira proper. Wollaston 
speaks of Madeira and the other Archipelagoes as being 
sure and certain witnesses of Forbes’ old continent,” and of 
course the Entomological world implicitly follows this vie\v. 
But to my eyes it would be difficult to imagine facts more 
opposed to such a view. It is really disgusting and humil- 
iating to see directly opposite conclusions drawn from the 
same facts. 

I have had some correspondence with Wollaston on this 
and other subjects, and I find that he coolly assumes, (l) that 
formerly insects possessed greater migratory powers than 
now, (2) that the old land was specially rich in centres of 
creation, (3) that the uniting land was destroyed before the 
special creations had time to diffuse, and (4) that the land 
was broken down before certain families and genera had 
time to reach from Europe or Africa the points of land in 
question. Are not these a jolly lot of assumptions ? and yet 
I shall see for the next dozen or score of years Wollaston 



Madeira, the Cape de Verdes, 
and St. Helena, whence he deduced 
evidence in support of the belief 
in the submerged continent of 
‘Atlantis.’ In an obituary notice 
by Mr. Rye (‘ Nature,’ 1878 ) he 
is described as working persis- 
tently '* upon a broad conception of 
the science to which he was de- 
voted,” while being at the same 
time “accurate, elaborate, and 
precise ad punctum, and naturally 



of a minutely critical habit.” His 
first scientific paper was written 
when he was an undergraduate at 
Jesus College, Cambridge. While 
at the University, he was an Asso- 
ciate and afterwards a Member of 
the Ray Club : this is a small 
society which still meets once a 
week, and where the undergraduate 
members, or Associates, receive 
much kindly encouragement from 
their elders.

I hope I have not wearied you, but I thought you would 
like to hear about this book, which strikes me as excellent in 
its facts, and the author a most nice and modest man. 

Most truly yours, 

C. Darwin. 



C. Darwin to JV. D. Fox. 

Down, March 19th [1855]. 

My dear Fox, — How long it is since we have had any 
communication, and I really want to hear how the world 
goes with you ; but my immediate object is to ask you to 
observe a point for me, and as I know now you are a very 
busy man with too much to do, I shall have a good chance 
of your doing what I want, as it would be hopeless to ask a 
quite idle man. As you have a Noah’s Ark, I do not doubt 
that you have pigeons. (How I wish by any chance they were 
fantails !) Now what I want to know is, at what age nestling 
pigeons have their tail feathers sufficiently developed to be 
counted. I do not think I ever saw a young pigeon. I am 
hard at work at my notes collecting and comparing them, in 
order in some two or three years to write a book with all the 
facts and arguments, which I can collect, for and versus the 
immutability of species. I want to get the young of our 
domestic breeds, to see how young, and to what degree the 
differences appear. I must either breed myself (which is no 
amusement but a horrid bore to me) the pigeons or buy their 
young ; and before I go to a seller, whom I have heard of 
from Yarrell, I am really anxious to know something about 
their development, not to expose my excessive ignorance, 
and therefore be excessively liable to be cheated and gulled. 
With respect to the one point of the tail feathers, it is of 
course in relation to the wonderful development of tail feathers 
in the adult fantail. If you had any breed of poultry pure, I 



i 855 -] feathers — SKELETONS. 47 

would beg a chicken with exact age stated, about a week or fort- 
night old ! to be sent in a box by post, if you could have the heart 
to kill one ; and secondly, would let me pay postage . . . Indeed, 
I should be very glad to have a nestling common pigeon sent, 
for I mean to make skeletons, and have already just begun 
comparing wild and tame ducks. And I think the results 
rather curious,* for on weighing the several bones very care- 
fully, when perfectly cleaned the proportional weights of the 
two have greatly varied, the foot of the tame having largely 
increased. How I wish I could get a little wild duck of a 
week old, but that I know is almost impossible. 

With respect to ourselves, I have not much to say; we 
have now a terribly noisy house with the whooping cough, 
but otherwise are ail well. Far the greatest fact about myself 
is that I have at last quite done with the everlasting barnacles. 
At the end of the year we had t\vo of our little boys very ill 
with fever and bronchitis, and all sorts of ailments. Partly 
for amusement, and partly for change of air, we went to 
London and took a house for a month, but it turned out 
a great failure, for that dreadful frost just set in when we 
went, and all our children got unwell, and E. and I had 
coughs and colds and rheumatism nearly all the time. We 
had put down first on our list of things to do, to go and 
see Mrs. Fox, but literally after waiting some time to see 
whether the weather would not improve, we had not a day 
when we both could go out. 

I do hope before very long you will be able to manage 
to pay us a visit. Time is slipping away, and we are 
getting oldish. Do tell us about yourself and all your large 

I know you will help me if you can with information

about the young pigeons ; and anyhow do write before very 
long. 

My dear Fox, your sincere old friend, 

C. Darwin. 

P.S. — Amongst all sorts of odds and ends, with which I am 
amusing myself, I am comparing the seeds of the variations 
of plants. I had formerly some wild cabbage seeds, which I 
gave to some one, was it to you ? It is a thousand to one it 
was thrown away, if not I should be very glad of a pinch of it. 

[The following extract from a letter to Mr. Fox (March 27th, 
1855) refers to the same subject as the last letter, and gives 
some account of the “species work:” “The way I shall kill 
young things will be to put them under a tumbler glass with a 
teaspoon of ether or chloroform, the glass being pressed down 
on some yielding surface, and leave them for an hour or two, 
young have such power of revivification. (I have thus killed 
moths and butterflies.) The best way would be to send them 
as you procure them, in pasteboard chip-boxes by post, on 
which you could write and just tie up with string ; and you will 
really make me happier by allowing me to keep an account 
of postage, &c. Upon my word I can hardly believe that 
any one could be so good-natured as to take such trouble 
and do such a very disagreeable thing as kill babies ; and I 
am very sure I do not know one soul who, except yourself, 
would do so. I am going to ask one thing more ; should 
old hens of any above poultry (not duck) die or become so 
old as to be useless, I wish you would send her to me per 
rail, addressed to ‘ C. Danvin, care of Mr. Acton, Post-office, 
Bromley, Kent.’ Will you keep this address I as shortest 
way for parcels. But I do not care so much for this, as I 
could buy the old birds dead at Baily’s to make skeletons. 
I should have written at once even if I had not heard from 
you, to beg you not to take trouble about pigeons, for Yarrell 
has persuaded me to attempt it, and I am now fitting up a

place, and have written to Baily about prices, &c. &c. Some- 
time (when you are better) I should like very much to hear 
a littie about your “ Littie Call Duck ” ; why so called ? And 
where you got it ? and what it is like ? . . . I was so ignorant 
1 did not even know there were three varieties of Dorking 
fowl ; how do they differ? . . . 

I forget whether I ever told you what the object of my 
present work is, — it is to view all facts that I can master 
(ehcu, cheu, how ignorant I find I am) in Natural History 
(as on geographical distribution, palaeontology, classification, 
hybridism, domestic animals and plants, &c. &c. 8:c.) to see 
how far they favour or are opposed to the notion that wild 
species are mutable or immutable : I mean with my utmost 
power to give all arguments and facts on both sides. I have 
a number of people helping me in every way, and giving me 
most valuable assistance; but I often doubt whether the 
subject will not quite overpower me. 

So much for the quasi-business part of my letter. I am 
very very sorry to hear so indifferent an account of your 
health : with your lai^e family your life is very precious, and 
I am sure with all your activity and goodness it ought to 
be a happy one, or as happy as can reasonably be e.xpected 
with all the cares of futurity on one. 

One cannot e.'cpect the present to be like the old Crux- 
major days at the foot of those noble willow stumps, the 
memory of which I revere. I now find my little entomology, 
which I wholly owe to you, comes in very useful. I am very 
glad to hear that you have given yourself a rest from Sunday 
duties. How much illness you have had in your life ! 
Farewell, my dear Fox. I assure you I thank you heartily 
for your proffered assistance.”] 

C. Darwin to W. D. Fox.

Mv DEAR Fox, — My correspondence has cost you a deal of 
trouble, though this note will not. I found yours on my return

home on Saturday after a week’s work in London. Whilst 
there I saw Yarrell, who told me he had carefully examined 
all points in the Call Duck, and did not feel any doubt 
about it being specifically identical, and that it had crossed 
freely with common varieties in St. James’s Park. I should 
therefore be very glad for a seven-days’ duckling and for one 
of the old birds, should one ever die a natural death. Yarrell 
told me that Sabine had collected forty varieties of the 
common duck 1 . . . Well, to return to business ; nobody, I am 
sure, could fix better for me than you the characteristic age of 
little chickens ; with respect to skeletons, I have feared it 
would be impossible to make them, but I suppose I shall be 
able to measure limbs, &c., by feeling the joints. What you 
say about old cocks just confirms what I thought, and I will 
make my skeletons of old cocks. Should an old wild turkey 
ever die, please remember me ; I do not care for a baby tur- 
key, nor for a mastiff. Very many thanks for your offer. I 
have puppies of bull-dogs and greyhound in salt, and I have 
had cart-horse and race-horse young colts carefully mea- 
sured. Whether I shall do any good I doubt. I am getting 
out of my depth. Most truly yours, 

C. Darwin. 

[An extract from a letter to Mr. Fox may find a place 
here, though of a later date, viz. July, 1855 : 

“ Many thanks for the seven days old white Dorking, and 
for the other promised ones. I am getting quite ‘ a chamber 
of horrors ; ’ I appreciate your kindness even more than 
before, for I have done the black deed and murdered an 
angelic little fantail, and a pouter at ten days old. I tried 
chloroform and ether for the first, and though evidently a 
perfectly easy death, it was prolonged ; and for the second 1 
tried putting lumps of cyanide of potassium in a very large 
damp bottle, half an hour before putting in the pigeon,

PIGEON FANCYING. 



I8SS.] 

and the prussic acid gas thus generated was very quickly 
fatal.” 

A letter to Mr. Fox (May 23rd, 1855) gives the first 
mention of my father’s laborious piece of work on the 
breeding of pigeons : 

“ I write now to say that I have been looking at some of 
our mongrel chickens, and I should say otie week old would 
do very well. The chief points which I am, and have been 
for years, very curious about, is to ascertain whether the 
young of our domestic breeds differ as much from each other 
as do their parents, and I have no faith in anything short 
of actual measurement and the Rule of Three. I hope and 
believe I am not giving so much trouble without a motive of 
sufficient worth. I have got my fantails and pouters (choice 
birds, I hope, as I paid 20r. for each pair from Baily) in a 
grand cage and pigeon-house, and they are a decided amuse- 
ment to me, and delight to H.” 

In the course of my father's pigeon-fancying enterprise he 
necessarily became acquainted with breeders, and was fond of 
relating his experiences as a member of the Columbarian 
and Philoperistera Clubs, where he met the purest enthusiasts 
of the ” fancy," and learnt much of the mysteries of their art. 
In writing to Mr. Huxley some years aftenvards, he quotes 
from a book on Pigeons by Mr. J. Eaton, in illustration of 
the “ extreme attention and close observation ” necessary to 
be a good fancier. 

“ In his [Mr. Eaton’s] treatise, devoted to the Almond 
Tumbler alone, which is a sub-variety of the short-faced 
variety, which is a variety of the Tumbler, as that is of the 
Rock-pigeon, Mr. Eaton says : ‘ There are some of the 
young fanciers who are over-covetous, who go for all the 
five properties at once (/.e. the five characteristic points 
which are mainly attended to, — C. D.), they have their reward 
E 2

52 GROWTH OF THE ‘ORIGIN.’ [1855. 

by getting nothing.’ In short, it is almost beyond the human 
intellect to attend to all the excellencies of the Almond 
Tumbler ! 

" To be a good breeder, and to succeed in improving any 
breed, beyond everything enthusiasm is required. Mr. Eaton 
has gained lots of prizes, listen to him. 

“ ‘ If it was possible for noblemen and gentlemen to know 
the amazing amount of solace and pleasure derived from the 
Almond Tumbler, when they begin to understand their («>. 
the tumbler’s) properties, I should think that scarce any 
nobleman or gentleman would be without their aviaries of 
Almond Tumblers.’ ” 

My father was fond of quoting this passage, and always 
with a tone of fellow-feeling for the author, though, no doubt, 
he had forgotten his own wonderings as a child that “ every 
gentleman did not become an ornithologist.” — (‘Autobio- 
graphy,’ p. 35.) 

To Mr. W. B. Tegetmeier, the well-known writer on poultry, 
&c., he was indebted for constant advice and co-operation. 
Their correspondence began in 1855, and lasted to 1881, 
when my father wrote : “ I can assure you that I often look 
back with pleasure to the old days when I attended to 
pigeons, fowls, 8:c., and when you gave me such valuable 
assistance. I not rarely regret that I have had so little 
strength that I have not been able to keep up old acquaint- 
ances and friendships.” My father’s letters to Mr. Teget- 
meier consist ■ almost entirely of series of questions relating 
to the different breeds of fowls, pigeons, &c., and are not, 
therefore, interesting. In reading through the pile of letters, 
one is much struck by the diligence of the writer’s search for 
facts, and it is made clear that Mr. Tegetmeier’s knowledge 
and judgment were completely trusted and highly valued by 
him. Numerous phrases, such as ‘‘ your note is a mine of 
wealth to me,” occur, expressing his sense of the value of 
Mr. Tegetmeier’s help, as well as words expressing his warm

1855.] 

appreciation of Mr. Tegetmeier’s unstinting zeal and kindness, 
or his “ pure and disinterested love of science.” On the 
subject of hive-bees and their combs, Mr. Tegetmeier’s help 
was also valued by my father, who wrote, “your paper on 
‘ Bees-cells,’ read before the British Association, was highly 
useful and suggestive to me.” 

To work out the problems on the Geographical Distri- 
butions of animals and plants on evolutionary principles, he 
had to study the means by which seeds, eggs, &c., can be 
transported across wide spaces of ocean. It was this need 
which gave an interest to the class of experiment to which 
the following letters allude.] 

C. Darwin to W. D. Fox. 

Down, May 17th [1855]. 

My dear Fox, — ^You will hate the very sight of my hand- 
writing ; but after this time I promise I will ask for nothing 
more, at least for a long time. As you live on sandy soil, 
have you lizards at all common ? If you have, should you 
think it too ridiculous to offer a reward for me for lizard’s 
eggs to the boys in your school ; a shilling for every half- 
dozen, or more if rare, till you got two or three dozen and 
send them to me? If snake’s eggs were brought in mistake 
it would be very well, for I want such also ; and we have 
neither lizards nor snakes about here. My object is to see 
whether such eggs will float on sea water, and whether they 
will keep alive thus floating for a month or two in my cellar. 
I am tiying experiments on transportation of all organic 
beings that I can ; and lizards are found on every island, and 
therefore I am very anxious to see whether their eggs stand 
sea water. Of course this note need not be answered, without, 
by a strange and favourable chance, you can some day answer 
it with the eggs. Your most troublesome friend, 

C. Darwin.

GROWTH OF THE ‘ORIGIN.’ 



[ 1855 - 



C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

April 13th [1855]. 

... I have had one experiment some little time in 
progress which will, I think, be interesting, namely, seeds 
in salt water, immersed in water of 32°-33‘’, which I have 
and shall long have, as I hlled a great tank with snow. 
When I wrote last I was going to triumph over you, for my 
experiment had in a slight degree succeeded ; but this, with 
infinite baseness, I did not tell, in hopes that you would 
say that you would eat all the plants which I could raise 
after immersion. It is very aggravating that I cannot in 
the least remember what you did formerly say that made me 
think you scoffed at the experiments vastly; for you now 
seem to view the experiment like a good Christian. I have 
in small bottles out of doors, exposed to variation of tempera- 
ture, cress, radish, cabbages, lettuces, carrots, and celery, and 
onion seed — four great families. These, after immersion for 
exactly one week, have all germinated, which I did not in the 
least expect (and thought how you would sneer at me) ; for 
the water of nearly all, and of the cress especially, smelt 
very badly, and the cress seed emitted a wonderful quantity 
of mucus (the ‘ Vestiges ’ would have expected them to turn 
into tadpoles), so as to adhere in a mass ; but these seeds 
germinated and grew splendidly. The germination of all 
(especially cress and lettuces) has been accelerated, except the 
cabbages, which have come up very irregularly, and a good 
many, I think, dead. One would have thought, from their 
native habitat, that the cabbage would have stood well. The 
Umbelliferae and onions seem to stand the salt well. I wash 
the seed before planting them. I have written to the 
Gardeners' Chronicle* though I doubt whether it was worth

while. If my success seems to make it worth while, I will 
send a seed list, to get you to mark some different classes 
of seeds. To-day I replant the same seeds as above after 
fourteen days’ immersion. As many sea-currents go a mile 
an hour, even in a week they might be transported 168 miles ; 
the Gulf Stream is said to go fifty and sixty miles a day. 
So much and too much on this head ; but my geese are 
always swans. . . . 

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

[April 14th, 1855.] 

. . . You are a good man to confess that you expected the 
cress would be killed in a week, for this gives me a nice little 
triumph. The children at first were tremendously eager, and 
asked me often, “whether I should beat Dr. Hooker!” The 
cress and lettuce have just vegetated well after twenty-one 
days’ immersion. But I will write no more, which is a great 
virtue in me ; for it is to me a very great pleasure telling you 
everything I do. 

... If you knew some of the experiments (if they may be 
so called) which] I am trying, you would have a good right 
to sneer, for they are so absurd even in my opinion that I dare 
not tell you. 

Have not some men a nice notion of experimentising ? 
I have had a letter telling me that seeds 7nust have great 
power of resisting salt water, for otherwise how could they 
get to islands ? This is the true way to solve a problem ! 

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, [1855.] 

My dear Hooker, — You have been a very good man to 
exhale some of your satisfaction in writing two notes to me ; 

on the germination of seeds after treatment in salt water, appeared in the 
‘ Linnean Soc. Journal,’ 1857, p. 130-

you could not have taken a better line, in my opinion ; but as- 
for showing your satisfaction in confounding my experiments, 
I assure you I am quite enough confounded — those horrid 
seeds, which, as you truly observe, if they sink they won’t 
float 

I have written to Scoresby and have had a rather dry 
answer, but very much to the purpose, and giving me nO’ 
hopes of any law unknown to me which might arrest their 
everlasting descent into the deepest depths of the ocean. By 
the way it was very odd, but I talked to Col. Sabine for half 
an hour on the subject, and could not make him see with 
respect to transportal the difficulty of the sinking questipn 1 
The bore is, if the confounded seeds will sink, I have been 
taking all this trouble in salting the ungrateful rascals for 
nothing. 

Everything has been going wrong with me lately ; the fish 
at the Zoolog. Soc. ate up lots of soaked seeds, and in 
imagination they had in my mind been swallowed, fish and 
all, by a heron, had been carried a hundred miles, been 
voided on the banks of some other lake and germinated 
splendidly, when lo and behold, the fish ejected vehemently, 
and with disgust equal to my own, all the seeds from their 
mouths.* 

But I am not going to give up the floating yet ; in first 
place I must try fresh seeds, though of course it seems far 
more probable that they will sink ; and secondly, as a last 
resource, I must believe in the pod or even whole plant or 
branch being washed into the sea ; with floods and slips and 



• In describing these troubles to 
Mr. Fox, my father wrote “ All 
nature is perverse and will not do 
a; I wish it ; and just at present I 
wish I had my old barnacles to 
work at, and nothing new." The 
experiment ultimately succeeded, 
and he wrote to Sir J. Hooker : — 



“ I find fish will greedily cat seeds 
of aquatic grasses, and that millet- 
seed put into fish and given to a 
stork, and then voided, will germi- 
nate. So this is the nursery rhyme 
of ‘ this is the stick that beats the 
pig,’ &c. &c.”

wet, I fancy the pods, &c. &c., would not open and shed their 
seeds. Do try your Mimosa seed at Kew. 

I had intended to have asked you whether the Mimosa 
scandens and Guilandina bonduc grows at Kew, to try fresh 
seeds. R. Brown tells me he believes four W. Indian seeds 
have been washed on shores of Europe. I was assured at 
Keeling Island that seeds were not rarely washed on shore : 
so float they must and shall 1 What a long yarn I have been 
spinning. 

If you have several of the Loffbden seeds, do soak some in 
tepid water, and get planted with the utmost care : this is an 
experiment after my own heart, with chances looo to l against 
its success. 



My DEAR Hooker, — I have just received your note. I 
am most sincerely and heartily glad at the news * it contains, 
and so is my wife. Though the income is but a poor one, 
yet the certainty, I hope, is satisfactory to yourself and Mrs. 
Hooker. As it must lead in future years to the Directorship, 
I do hope you look at it as a piece of good fortune. For my 
own taste I cannot fancy a pleasanter position, than the Head 
of such a noble and splendid place ; far better, I should think, 
than a Professorship in a great town. The more I think of 
it, the gladder I am. But I will say no more ; except that I 
hope Mrs. Hooker is pretty well pleased. . . . 

As the Gardeuerd Chronicle put in my question, and 
took notice of it, I think I am bound to send, which I had 
thought of doing next week, my first report to Lindley to 
give him the option of inserting it ; but I think it likely that 
he may not think it fit for a Gardening pc

my experiments are ended (should the results appear worthy) 
and should the ‘ Linnean Journal’ not object to the previous 
publication of imperfect and provisional reports, I should be 
delighted to insert the final report tlicre ; for it has cost me so 
much trouble, that I should think that probably the result 
was worthy of more permanent record than a newspaper ; 
but I think I am bound to send it first to Lindley. 

I begin to think the floating question more serious than the 
germinating one ; and am making all the enquiries which I 
can on the subject, and hope to get some little light on it . . .

which before was cultivated from time immemorial ; and we

precious, for as I told you it is for probably a most foolish 
purpose. I read somewhere that no plant closes its leaves 
so promptly in darkness, and I want to cover it up daily for 
half an hour, and see if I can teach it to close by itself, or 

more easily than at first in darkness I cannot make 

out why you would prefer a continental transmission, as I 
think you do, to carriage by sea. I should have thought you 
would have been pleased at as many means of transmission 
as possible. For my own pet theoretic notions, it is quite 
indifferent whether they are transmitted by sea or land, as 
long as some tolerably probable way is shown. But it shocks 
my philosophy to create land, without some other and inde- 
pendent evidence. Whenever we meet, by a very few words 
I should, I think, more clearly understand your views. . . . 

I have just made out my first grass, hurrah ! hurrah ! I 
must confess that fortune favours the bold, for, as good luck 
would have it, it was the easy Anthoxanthum odoratum: 
nevertheless it is a great discovery ; I never expected to 
make out a grass in all my life, so hurrah ! It has done my 
stomach surprising good. . . . 



C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, [June?] 15th, [1S55]. 

My dear Hooker, — I just write one line to say that the 
Hedysarum is come quite safely, and thank you for it. 

You cannot imagine what amusement you have given me 
by naming those three grasses : I have just got paper to dry 
and collect all grasses. If ever you catch quite a beginner, 
and want to give him a taste for Botany, tell him to make 
a perfect list of some little field or wood. Both Miss Thorley 
and I agree that it gives a really uncommon interest to the 
work, having a nice little definite world to work on, instead of 
the awful abyss and immensity of all British Plants. 

Adios. I was really consummately Impudent to express

that I may premise that I have for several years been collect-

remark seems to hold good amongst animals, I try to test 
it in Plants. [Here follows a request for information on

trifling suggestion to such a botanist as yourself; but from 
what I saw and have heard of you from our dear and kind 
friend Hooker, I hope and think that you will forgive me, and 
believe me, with much respect. 

Dear sir, yours very faithfully, 

Charles Darwin. 

C. Darwin to Asa Gray. 

Down, June 8th [1855]. 

My dear Sir, — I thank you cordially for your remarkably 
kind letter of the 22nd ult., and for the extremely pleasant 
and obliging manner in which you have taken my rather 
troublesome questions. I can hardly tell you how much 
your list of Alpine plants has interested me, and I can now 
in some degree picture to myself the plants of your Alpine 
summits. The new edit, of your Manual is capital news for 
me. I know from your preface how pressed you are for 
room, but it would take no space to append (Eu) in brackets 
to any European plant, and, as far as I am concerned, this 
would answer every purpose.* From my own experience, 
whilst making out English plants in our manuals, it has often 
struck me how much interest it would give if some notion 
of their range had been given ; and so, I cannot doubt, your 
American inquirers and beginners would much like to know 
which of their plants were indigenous and which European. 
Would it not be well in the Alpine plants to append the very 
same addition which you have now sent me in MS. ? though 
here, owing to your kindness, I do not speak selfishly, but 
merely pro bono Americano publico. I presume it would be 
too troublesome to give in your manual the habitats of those 
plants found west of the Rocky Mountains, and likewise those 
found in Eastern Asia, taking the Yenesel (?), — which, if I 
remember right, according to Gmelin, is the main partition

line of Siberia. Perhaps Siberia more concerns the northern 
Flora of Nortli America. The ranges of the plants to the 
east and west, viz. whether most found are in Greenland and 
Western Europe, or in E. Asia, appears to me a very interest- 
ing point as tending to show whether the migration has been 
eastward or westward. Pray believe me that I am most 
entirely conscious that the only use of these remarks is to 
show a botanist what points a non-botanist is curious to 
learn ; for I think every one who studies profoundly a subject 
often becomes unaware [on] what points the ignorant require 
information. I am so very glad that you think of drawing up 
some notice on your geographical distribution, for the area 
of the Manual strikes me as in some points better adapted 
for comparison with Europe than that of the whole of North 
America. You ask me to state definitely some of the points 
on which I much wish for information ; but I really hardly 
can, for they are so vague ; and I rather wish to see what 
results will come out from comparisons, than have as yet 
defined objects. I presume that, like other botanists, you 
would give, for your area, the proportion (leaving out intro- 
duced plants) to the whole of the great leading families : this 
is one point I had intended (and, indeed, have done roughly) 
to tabulate from your book, but of course I could have done 
it only very imperfectly. I should also, of course, have ascer- 
tained the proportion, to the whole Flora, of the European 
plants (leaving out introduced) and of the separate great 
families, in order to .speculate on means of transportal. By 
the way, I ventured to send a few days ago a copy of the 
Gardeners' Chronicle with a short report by me of some 
trifling experiments which I have been trying on the power 
of seeds to withstand sea water. I do not know whether 
it has struck you, but it has me, that it would be advisable 
for botanists to give in whole numbers, as well as in the 
lowest fraction, the proportional numbers of the families, thus 
I make out from your Manual that of the indigenous plants

iSSSj SUGGESTIONS AND QUERIES. 63 

tlie proportion of the Umbelliferae are =-^ ; for, without 
one knows the wlwle numbers, one cannot judge how really 
close the numbers of the plants of the same family are in two 
distant countries ; but very likely you may think this super- 
fluous. Mentioning these proportional numbers, I may give 
you an instance of the sort of points, and how vague and 
futile they often are, which I attempt to work out . . . ; 
reflecting on R. Brown’s and Hooker’s remark, that near 
identity of proportional numbers of the great families in two 
countries, shows probably that they were once continuously 
united, I thought I would calculate the proportions of, for 
instance, the introduced Composite in Great Britain to all the 
introduced plants, and the result was In our abori- 

ginal or indigenous flora the proportion is ; and in many 
other cases I found an equally striking correspondence. I 
then took your Manual, and worked out the same question ; 
here I find in the Compositae an almost equally striking 
correspondence, viz. in the introduced plants, and 

=-i- in the indigenous; but when I came to the other 
families I found the proportion entirely different, shomng 
that the coincidences in the British Flora were probably 
accidental ! 

You will, I presume, give the proportion of the species 
to the genera, »>. show on an average how many species each 
genus contains ; though I have done this for myself. 

If it would not be too troublesome, do you not think it would 
be very interesting, and give a very good idea of your Flora, 
to divide the species into three groups, viz. (a) species com- 
mon to the old world, stating numbers common to Europe 
and Asia ; {b) indigenous species, but belonging to genera 
found in the Old World ; and (c) species belonging to genera 
confined to America or the New World ? To make (according 
to my ideas) perfection perfect, one ought to be told whether 
there are other cases, like Erica, of genera common in Europe 
or in Old World not found in your area. But honestly I feel

that it is quite ridiculous my writing to you at such length on 
the subject ; but, as you have asked me, I do it gratefully, and 
write to you as I should to Hooker, who often laughs at me 
unmercifully, and I am sure you have better reason to do so. 

There is one point on which I am most anxious for inform- 
ation, and I mention it with the greatest hesitation, and 
only in the full belief that you will believe me that I have 
not the folly and presumption to hope for a second that you 
will give it, without you can with very little trouble. The 
point can at present interest no one but myself, which makes 
the case wholly different from geographical distribution. The 
only way in which, I think, you possibly could do it with little 
trouble would be to bear in mind, whilst correcting your proof- 
sheets of the Manual, my question and put a cross or mark 
to the species, and whenever sending a parcel to Hooker to 
let me have such old sheets. But this would give you the 
trouble of remembering my question, and I can hardly hope 
or expect that you will do it But I will just mention what I 
want ; it is to have marked the “ close species ” in a Flora, so 
as to compare in different Floras whether the same genera 
have “close species,” and for other purposes too vague to 
enumerate. I have attempted, by Hooker’s help, to ascertain 
in a similar way whether the different species of the same 
genera in distant quarters of the globe are variable or 
present varieties; The definition I should give of a ''close 
species" was one that you thought specifically distinct, but 
which you could conceive some other good botanist might 
think only a race or variety ; or, again, a species that you 
had trouble, though having opportunities of knowing it well, 
in discriminating from some other species. Supposing that 
you were inclined to be so very kind as to do this, and could 
(which I do not expect) spare the time, as I have said, a 
mere cross to each such species in any useless proof-sheets 
would give me the information desired, which, I may add, 
I know must be vague.

... I think I am getting a mild case about Charlock 
seed;* but just as about salting, ill luck to it, I cannot 
remember how many years you would allow that Charlock 
seed might live in the ground. Next time you write, show 
a bold face, and say in how many years, you think. Charlock 
seed would probably all be dead. A man told me the other 
day of, as I thought, a splendid instance, — and splendid it 
was, for according to his evidence the seed came up alive out 
of the lower part of the London Clay ! ! ! I disgusted him by 
telling him that Palms ought to have come up. 

You ask how far I go in attributing organisms to a common 
descent : I answer I know not ; the way in which I intend 
treating the subject, is to show {as far as lean) the facts and 
arguments for and against the common descent of the species 
of the same genus ; and then show how far the same argu- 
ments tell for or against forms, more and more widely 
different : and when we come to forms of different orders and

XIn the Autobiographical chapter (Vol. I. p. 84) my father 
wrote: — “Early in 1856 Lyell advised me to write out my 
views pretty fully, and I began at once to do so on a scale 
three or four times as extensive as that which was afterwards 
followed in my ‘ Origin of Species ; ’ yet it was only an 
abstract of the materials which I had collected.” The letters 
in the present chapter are chiefly concerned with the prepara- 
tion of this unfinished book. 

The work was begun on May 14th, and steadily continued 
up to June 1858, when it was interrupted by the arrival of 
Mr. Wallace’s MS. During the two years which we are now 
•considering, he wrote ten chapters (that is about one-halQ of 
the projected book. He remained for the most part at home, 
but paid several visits to Dr. Lane’s Water-Cure Establish- 
ment at Moor Park, during one of which he made a pilgrimage 
to the shrine of Gilbert White at Sclbornc.]

it goes against my prejudices. To give a fair sketch would be 
absolutely Impossible, for every proposition requires such an 
array of facts. If I were to do anything, it could only refer 
to the main agency of change — selection — and perhaps point 
out a very few of the leading features, which countenance 
such a view, and some few of the main difficulties. But I do 
not know what to think ; I rather hate the idea of writing 
for priority, yet I certainly should be vexed if any one 
were to publish my doctrines before me. Anyhow, I thank 
you heartily for your sympathy. I shall be in London next 
week, and I will call on you on Thursday morning for one 
hour precisely, so as not to lose much of your time and my 
own ; but will you let me this time come as early as 9 o’clock, 
for I have much which I must do in the morning in my 
strongest time ? Farewell, my dear old patron.

publication for which they might be abused. If I publish

anything it must be a ve>y thin and little volume, giving a 
sketch of my views and difficulties ; but it is really dreadfully 
unphilosophical to give a rhumi, without exact references, of 
an unpublished work. But Lyell seemed to think I might 
do this, at the suggestion of friends, and on the ground, which 
I might state, that I had been at work for eighteen • years, and 
yet could not publish for several years, and especially as I 
could point out difficulties which seemed to me to require 
especial investigation. Now what think you ? I should be 
really grateful for advice. I thought of giving up a couple of 
months and writing such a sketch, and trying to keep my 
judgment open whether or no to publish it when completed. 
It will be simply impossible for me to give exact references ; 
anything important I should state on the authority of the 
author generally ; and instead of giving all the facts on 
which I ground my opinion, I could give by memory only 
one or two. In the Preface I would state that the work 
could not be considered strictly scientific, but a mere sketch 
or outline of a future work in which full references, &a, 
should be given. Eheu, eheu, 1 believe I should sneer at 
any one else doing this, and my only comfort is, that I 
truly never dreamed of it, till Lyell suggested it, and seems 
deliberately to think it advisable. 

I am in a peck of troubles, and do pray forgive me for 
troubling you.

liminary Essay" (i.e. if anything whatever is published; for 
Lyell seemed rather to doubt on this head)* ; but I cannot bear 
the idea of begging some Editor and Council to publish, and 
then perhaps to have to apologise humbly for having led them 
into a scrape. In this one respect I am in the state which,, 
according to a very wise saying of my father’s, is the only 
fit state for asking advice, viz. with my mind firmly made up,, 
and then, as my father used to say, good advice was very 
comfortable, and it was easy to reject bad advice. But 
Heaven knows I am not in this state with respect to publish- 
ing at all any preliminary essay. It yet strikes me as quite 
unphilosophical to publish results without the full details 
which have led to such results. 

It is a melancholy, and I hope not quite true view of yours 
that facts will prove anything, and are therefore superfluous ! 
But I have rather exaggerated, I see, your doctrine. I do- 
not fear being tied down to error, i.e. I. feel pretty sure I 
should give up anything false published in the preliminary 
essay, in my larger work ; but I may thus, it is very true, do 
mischief by spreading error, which as I have often heard you 
say is much easier spread than corrected. I confess I lean 
more and more to at least making the attempt and drawing 
up a sketch and trying to keep my judgment, whether to 
publish, open. But I always return to my fixed idea that it 
is dreadfully unphilosophical to publish without full details. 
I certainly think my future work in full would profit by 
hearing what my friends or critics (if reviewed) thought of 
the outline. 

To any one but you I should apologise for such long discus- 
sion on so personal an affair ; but I believe, and indeed you 
have proved it by the trouble you have taken, that tliis would 
be superfluous. 

Yours truly obliged,

that the Essay might supersede and take away all novelty 
and value from any future larger Book, is very true ; and 
that would grieve me beyond everything. On the other

of your disciples are taking. 

Here, poor Forbes made a continent to {i.e. e.Ntending to]

Hooker makes one from New Zealand to South America and 
round the World to Kerguelen Land. Here is Wollaston 
speaking of Madeira and P. Santo “ as the sure and certain 
witnesses of a former continent.” Here is Woodward writes 
to me, if you grant a continent over 200 or 300 miles of ocean 
depths (as if that was nothing), why not extend a continent to 
every island in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans? And all 
this within the existence of recent species 1 If you do not 
stop this, if there be a lower region for the punishment of 
geologists, I believe, my great master, you will go there. 
Why, your disciples in a slow and creeping manner beat all

the great chief of the Catastrophists. 

There, I have done myself a great deal of good, and have

CONTINENTAL EXTENSION.

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down [June] 17th, 1856. 

... I have been very deeply interested by Wollaston’s book • 
though I iixSct greatly from many of his doctrines. Did you 
ever read anything so rich, considering how very far he goes, 
as his denunciations against those who go further : “ most 
mischievous,” “absurd,” “unsound.” Theology is at the 
bottom of some of this. I told him he was like Calvin 
burning a heretic. It is a very valuable and clever book in 
my opinion. He has evidently read very little out of his own 
line. I urged him to read the New Zealand essay. His 
Geology also is rather eocene, as I told him. In fact I wrote 
most frankly ; I fear too frankly ; he says he is sure that 
ultra-honesty is my characteristic : I do not know whether 
he meant it as a sneer ; I hope not Talking of eocene geology, 
I got so wroth about the Atlantic continent, more especially 
from a note from Woodward (who has published a capital 
book on shells), who does not seem to doubt that every island 
in the Pacific and Atlantic arc the remains of continents, sub- 
merged within period of existing species, that I fairly ex- 
ploded, and wrote to Lyell to protest, and summed up all the 
continents created of late years by Forbes (the head sinner !) 
yourself, Wollaston, and Woodward, and a pretty nice little 
extension of land they make altogether ! I am fairly rabid 
on the question and therefore, if not wrong already, am 
pretty sure to become so . . . 

I have enjoyed your note much. Adios,

humble, and allow you all to make continents, as easily as a 
cook does pancakes. 



C. Darwin to C. Lyell. 

Down, June 25th [1856]. 

My dear Lyell, — I will have the following tremendous 
letter copied to make the reading easier, and as I want ta 
keep a copy. 

As you say you would like to hear my reasons for being 
most unwilling to believe in the continental extensions of late 
authors, I gladly write them, as, without 1 am convinced of 
my error, I shall have to give them condensed in my essay, 
when I discuss single and multiple creation ; I shall therefore 
be particularly glad to have your general opinion on them, 
I may quite likely have persuaded myself in my wrath that 
there is more in them than there is. If there was much more 
reason to admit a continental extension in any one or two 
instances (as in Madeira) than in other cases, I should feel no- 
difficulty whatever. But if on account of European plants, 
and littoral sea shells, it is thought necessary to join Madeira 
to the mainland. Hooker is quite right to join New Holland 
to New Zealand, and Auckland Island (and Raoul Island to 
N.E.), and these to S. America and the Falklands, and these 
to Tristan d’Acunha, and these to Kerguelen Land ; thus 
making, either strictly at the same time, or at different periods, 
but all within the life of recent beings, an almost circumpolar 
belt of land. So again Galapagos and Juan Fernandez must 
be joined to America ; and if we trust to littoral sea shells, the 
Galapagos must have been joined to the Pacific Islands (2400 
miles distant) as well as to America, and as Woodward seems 
to think all the islands in the Pacific into a magnificent con- 
tinent ; also the islands in the Southern Indian Ocean into 
another continent, with Madagascar and Africa, and perhaps. 
India. In the North Atlantic, Europe will stretch half-way

across the ocean to the Azores, and further north right across. 
In short, we must suppose probably, half the present ocean 
was land within the period of living organisms. The Globe 
within this period must have had a quite different aspect. 
Now the only way to test this, that I can see, is to consider 
whether the continents have undergone within this same pe- 
riod such wonderful permutations. In all North and South 
and Central America, we have both recent and miocene (or 
eocene) shells, quite distinct on the opposite sides, and hence 
I cannot doubt that fundamentally America has held its place 
since at least, the miocene period. In Africa almost all the 
living shells are distinct on the opposite sides of the inter- 
tropical regions, short as the distance is compared to the range 
of marine mollusca, in uninterrupted seas ; hence I infer that 
Africa has e.xisted since our present species were created. 
Even the isthmus of Suez and the Aralo-Caspian basin have 
had a great antiquity. So I imagine, from the tertiary depos- 
its, has India. In Australia the great fauna of extinct mar- 
supials shows that before the present mammals appeared, 
Australia was a separate continent. I do not for one second 
doubt that very large portions of all these continents have 
undergone great changes of level within this period, but yet I 
conclude that fundamentally they stood as barriers in the sea, 
where they now stand ; and therefore I should require the 
weightiest evidence to make me believe in such immense 
changes within the period of living organisms in our oceans, 
where, moreover, from the great depths, the changes must 
have been vaster in a vertical sense. 

Secondly. Submerge our present continents, leaving a few 
mountain peaks as islands, and what will the character of the 
islands be ? — Consider that the Pyrenees, Sierra Nevada, 
Apennines, Alps, Carpathians, are non-volcanic, Etna and 
Caucasus, volcanic. In Asia, Altai and Himalaya, I believe 
non-volcanic. In North Africa the non-volcanic, as 1 imagine, 
Alps of Abyssinia and of the Atlas. In South Africa, the

Snow Mountains. In Australia, the non- volcanic Alps. In 
North America, the White Mountains, Alleghanies and Rocky 
Mountains — some of the latter alone, I believe, volcanic. In 
South America to the east, the non-volcanic [Silla] of Caracas, 
and Itacolumi of Brazil, further south the Sierra jVentanas, 
and in the Cordilleras, many volcanic but not all. Now 
compare these peaks with the oceanic islands ; as far as 
known all are volcanic, except St Paul’s (a strange bedevilled 
rock), and the Seychelles, if this latter can be called oceanic, 
in the line of Madagascar ; the Falklands, only 500 miles off, 
are only a shallow bank ; New Caledonia, hardly oceanic, is 
another exception. This argument has to me great weight 
Compare on a Geographical Map, islands which, we have 
several reasons to suppose, were connected with mainland, as 
Sardinia, and how different it appears. Believing, as I am 
inclined, that continents as continents, and oceans as oceans, 
are. of immense antiquity — I should say that if any of the 
existing oceanic islands have any relation of any kind to 
continents, they are forming continents ; and that by the 
time they could form a continent, the volcanoes would be 
denuded to their cores, leaving peaks of syenite, diorite, or 
porphyry. But have we nowhere any last wreck of a con- 
tinent, in the midst of the ocean ? St. Paul’s Rock, and such 
old battered volcanic islands, as St. Helena, may be ; but 
I think we can see some reason why we should have less 
evidence of sinking than of rising continents (if my view in 
my Coral volume has any truth in it, viz. : that volcanic 
outbursts accompany rising areas), for during subsidence 
there will be no compensating agent at work, in rising areas 
there will be the additional clement of outpoured volcanic 

Thirdly. Considering the depth of the ocean, I was, before I 
got your letter, inclined vehemently to dispute the vast 
amount of subsidence, but I must strike my colours. With 
respect to coral reefs, I carefully guarded against its being

supposed that a continent was indicated by the groups of 
atolls. It is difficult to guess, as it seems to me, the 
amount of subsidence indicated by coral reefs ; but in such 
large areas as the Lowe Archipelago, the Marshall Archi- 
pelago, and Laccadive group, it would, judging from the 
heights of existing oceanic archipelagoes, be odd, if some 
peaks of from 8000 to 10,000 feet had not been buried. Even 
after your letter a suspicion crossed me whether it would bo 
fair to argue from subsidences in the middle of the greatest 
oceans to continents ; but refreshing my memory by talking 
with Ramsay in regard to the probable thickness in one vertical 
line of the Silurian and carboniferous formation, it seems there 
must have been at least 10,000 feet of subsidence during these 
formations in Europe and North America, and therefore 
during the continuance of nearly the same set of organic 
beings. But even 1 2,000 feet would not be enough for the 
Azores, or for Hooker’s continent ; I believe Hooker does not 
infer a continuous continent, but approximate groups of 
islands, with, if we may judge from existing continents, not 
profoundly deep sea between them ; but the argument from 
the volcanic nature of nearly every existing oceanic island 
tells against such supposed groups of islands, — for I presume 
he does not suppose a mere chain of volcanic islands belting 
the southern hemisphere. 

Fourthly. The supposed continental extensions do not seem 
to me, perfectly to account for all the phenomena of distri- 
bution on islands ; as the absence of mammals and Batra- 
chians ; the absence of certain great groups of insects on 
Madeira, and of Acacim and Banksias, &c., in New Zealand ; 
the paucity of plants in some cases, &c. Not that those who 
believe in various accidental means of dispersal, can explain 
most of these cases ; but they may at least say that these 
facts seem hardly compatible with former continuous land. 

Finally. For these several reasons, and especially con- 
sidering it certain (in which you will agree) that we arc ex-

tremely ignorant of means of dispersal, I cannot avoid think- 
ing that Forbes’ ‘ Atlantis ’ was an ill-service to science, as 
checking a close study of means of dissemination. I shall be 
really grateful to hear, as briefly as you like, whether these 
ailments have any weight with you, putting yourself in the 
position of an honest judge. I told Hooker I was going to 
write to you on this subject ; and I should like him to read 
this ; but whether he or you will think it worth time and 
postage remains to be proved. 

Yours most truly, 

Charles Darwin. 

[On July 8th he wrote to Sir Charles Lyell. 

“ I am sorry you cannot give any verdict on Continental 
e.xtensions ; and I infer that you think my argument of not 
much weight against such extensions. I know I wish I could 
believe so.”] 



C. Darwin to Asa Gray. 

Down, July 20th [iSj6]. 

... It is not a little egotistical, but I should like to tell 
you (and I do not think I have) how I view my work. 
Nineteen years (!) ago it occurred to me that whilst otherwise 
employed on Nat. Hist., I might perhaps do good if I noted 
any sort of facts bearing on the question of the origin of 
species, and this I have since been doing. Either species 
have been independently created, or they have descended 
from other species, like varieties from one species. I think it 
can be shown to be probable that man gets his most distinct 
varieties by preserving such as arise best worth keeping and 
destroying the others, but I should fill a quire if I were to go 
on. To be brief, I assume that species arise like our domestic 
varieties with much extinction ; and then test this hypothesis 
by comparison with as many general and pretty well-esta- 
blished propositions as I can find made out, — in geographical

1856.] GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION. 79 

distribution, geological history, affinities, &c. &c. And it 
seems to me that, supposing that such hypothesis were to 
explain such general propositions, we ought, in accordance 
with the common way of following all sciences, to admit it till 
some better hypothesis be found out. For to my mind to 
say that species were created so and so is no scientific explan- 
ation, only a reverent way of saying it is so and so. But it 
is nonsensical trying to show how I try to proceed, in the 
compass of a note. But as an honest man, I must tell you that 
I have come to the heterodox conclusion, that there are no 
such things as independently created species — that species are 
only strongly defined varieties. I know that this will make 
you despise me. I do not much underrate the many huge 
difficulties on this view, but yet it seems to me to explain too 
much, otherwise inexplicable, to be false. Just to allude to 
one point in your last note, viz. about species of the same 
genus getierally having a common or continuous area ; if they 
are actual lineal descendants of one species, this of course 
would be the case ; and the sadly too many exceptions (for 
me) have to be explained by climatal and geological changes. 
A fortiori on this view (but on exactly same grounds), all the 
individuals of the same species should have a continuous 
distribution. On this latter branch of the subject I have put 
a chapter together, and Hooker kindly read it over. I 
thought the exceptions and difficulties were so great that on 
the whole the balance weighed against my notions, but I was 
much pleased to find that it seemed to have considerable 
weight with Hooker, who said he had never been so much 
staggered about the permanence of species. 

I must say one word more in justification (for I feel sure 
that your tendency will be to despise me and my crotchets), 
that all my notions about how species change are derived 
from long-continued study of the works of (and converse 
with) agriculturists and horticulturists ; and I believe I 
see my way pretty clearly on the means used by nature to

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, July 30th, 1856. 

'My DEAR Hooker, — Your letter is of much value to me. 
I was not able to get a definite answer from Lyell,* as you will 
see in the enclosed letters, though I inferred that he thought 
nothing of my arguments. Had it not been for this corre- 
spondence, I should have written sadly too strongly. You 
may rely on it I shall put my doubts moderately. There 
never was such a predicament as mine : here you continental 
e.xtenslonists would remove enormous difficulties opposed to 
me, and yet I cannot honestly admit the doctrine, and must 
therefore say so. I cannot get over the fact that not a frag- 
ment of secondary or palaeozoic rock has been found on any 
island above 500 or 600 miles from a mainland. You rather 
misunderstand me when you think I doubt the possibility of 
subsidence of 20,000 or 30,000 feet ; it is only probability, con- 
sidering such evidence as we have independently of distribution. 
I have not yet worked out in full detail the distribution of 
mammalia, both identical and allied, with respect to the one 
element of depth of the sea ; but as far as I have gone, the 
results are to me surprisingly accordant with my very most 
troublesome belief in not such great geographical changes as 
you believe ; and in mammalia we certainly know more of 
means of distribution than in any other class. Nothing is so 
ve.xatious to me, as so constantly finding myself drawing 
different conclusions from better judges than myself, from 
the same facts. 

I fancy I have lately removed many (not geographical) 
great difficulties opposed to my notions, but God knows it 
may be all hallucination.

CLASSIFICATION. 



Please return Lyell’s letters. 

What a capital letter of Lyell’s that to you is, and what a 
wonderful man he is. I differ from him greatly in thinking 
that those who believe that species are not fixed will multiply 
specific names : I know in my own case my most frequent 
source of doubt was whether others would not think this or 
that was a God-created Barnacle, and surely deserved a 
name. Othenvise I should only have thought whether the 
amount of difference and permanence was sufficient to justify 
a name : I am, also, surprised at his thinking it immaterial 
whether species are absolute or not : whenever it is proved 
that all species are produced by generation, by laws of change, 
what good evidence we shall have of the gaps in formations. 
And what a science Natural History will be, when we are in 
our graves, when all the laws of change are thought one of 
the most important parts of Natural History. 

I cannot conceive why Lyell thinks such notions as mine 
or of ‘ Vestiges,’ will invalidate specific centres. But I must 
not run on and take up your time. My MS. will not, I fear, 
bo copied before you go abroad. With hearty thanks. 

Ever yours, 

C. Darwin. 

P.S. — After giving much condensed, my argument versus 
continental extensions, I shall append some such sentence, 
as that two better judges than myself have considered these 
arguments, and attach no weight to them.

the more I think (and I cannot get the subject out of my 
head), the more difficult I find it. If there were only some 
half-dozen cases, I should not feel the least difficulty ; but 
the generality of the facts of all islands (except one or two) 
having a considerable part of their productions in common 
with one or more mainlands utterly staggers me. What a 
wonderful case of the Epacridae 1 It is most vexatious, also- 
humiliating, to me that I cannot follow and subscribe to the 
way in which you strikingly put your view of the case. 
I look at your facts (about Eucalyptus, &c.) as damning 
against continental extension, and if you like also damning 
against migration, or at least of enormous difficulty. I see 
the ground of our difference (in a letter I must put myself 
on an equality in arguing) lies, in my opinion, that scarcely 
anything is known of means of distribution. I quite agree 
with A. De Candolle’s (and I dare say your) opinion that it 
is poor work putting together the merely possible means of 
distribution ; but I see no other way in which the subject can 
be attacked, for I think that A. De Candolle’s argument, 
that no plants have been introduced into England except by 
man’s agency, of no weight. I cannot but think that the 
theory of continental extension does do some little harm 
as stopping investigation of the means of dispersal, which, 
whether negative or positive, seems to me of value ; when 
negatived, then every one who believes in single centres will 
have to admit continental extensions. 

... I see from your remarks that you do not understand 
my notions (whether or no worth anything) about modifica- 
tion ; I attribute very little to the direct action of climate, &c. 
I suppose, in regard to specific centres, we are at cross 
purposes ; I should call the kitchen garden in which the red 
cabbage was produced, or the farm in which Bakewell made 
the Shorthorn cattle, the specific centre of these species I 
And surely this is centralisation enough ! 

I thank you most sincerely for all your assistance; and

whether or no my book may be wretched, you have done your 
best to make it less wretched. Sometimes I am in very good 
spirits and sometimes very low about it. My own mind is 
decided on the question of the origin of species ; but, good 
heavens, how little that is worth ! . . , 

[With regard to “ specific centres,” a passage from a letter 
dated July 25, 1856, from Sir Charles Lyell to Sir J. D. Hooker 
(‘ Life,’ vol. ii. p. 216) is of interest : 

“ I fear much that if Darwin argues that species are 
phantoms, he will also have to admit that single centres of 
dispersion are phantoms also, and that would deprive me 
of much of the value which I ascribe to the present provinces 
of animals and plants, as illustrating modem and tertiary 
changes in physical geography.” 

He seems to have recognised, however, that the phantom 
doctrine would soon have to be faced, for he wrote in the 
same letter : “ Whether Darwin persuades you and me to 
renounce our faith in species (when geological epochs arc 
considered) or not, I foresee that many will go over to the 
indefinite modifiability doctrine.” 

In the autumn my father was still working at geogp-aphical 
distribution, and again sought aid from Sir J. D. Hooker. 

“ In the course of some weeks, you unfortunate wretch, you 
will have my MS. on one point of Geographical Distribution. 
I will, however, never ask such a favour again ; but in regard 
to this one piece of MS., it is of infinite importance to me for 
you to see it ; for never in my life have I felt such difficulty 
what to do, and I heartily wish I could slur the whole subject 
over.” 

In a letter to Sir J. D. Hooker (June, 1856), the following 
characteristic passage occurs, suggested, no doubt, by the

kind of work which his chapter on Geographical Distribution 
entailed : 

"There is wonderful ill logic in his [E. Forbes’] famous 
and admirable memoir on distribution, as it appears to me, 
now that I have got it up so as to give the heads in a page. 
Depend on it, my saying is a true one, viz. that a compiler 
is a great man, and an original man a commonplace man. 
Any fool can generalise and speculate ; but, oh, my heavens ! 
to get up at second hand a New Zealand Flora, that is work.’’]

... I remember you protested against Lyell’s advice 
of writing a shetch of my species doctrines. Well, when I 
began I found it such unsatisfactory work that I have 
desisted, and am now drawing up my work as perfect as my 
materials of nineteen years’ collecting suffice, but do not 
intend to stop to perfect any line of investigation beyond 
current work. Thus far and no farther I shall follow Lyell’s 
urgent advice. Your remarks weighed with me considerably. 
I find to my sorrow it will run to quite a big book. I have 
found my careful work at pigeons really invaluable, as en- 
lightening me on many points on variation under domesti- 
cation. The copious old literature, by which I can trace the 
gradual changes in the breeds of pigeons has been extra- 
ordinarily useful to me. I have just had pigeons and fowls 
a/ive from the Gambia I Rabbits and ducks I am attending 
to pretty carefully, but less so than pigeons. I find most re- 
markable differences in the skeletons of rabbits. Have you 
ever kept any odd breeds of rabbits, and can you give me 
any details ? One other question. You used to keep hawks ; 
do you at all know, after eating a bird, how soon after they 
throw up the pellet ?

No subject gives me so much trouble and doubt and diffi-

power of floating and resistance to the injurious action of 
salt water. I will not apologise for writing so much about

you would say it was (and I knew you would say it very 
kindly) so bad, that you would have begged me to have 
burnt the whole. To my own mind my MS. relieved me 
of some few difficulties, and the difficulties seemed to me 
pretty fairly stated, but I had become so bewildered with 
conflicting facts, evidence, reasoning and opinions, that I felt 
to myself that I had lost all judgment. Your general verdict

NATURAL SELECTION. 



87 



separate question, but the conclusion which I have come to, 
quite independently of geographical distribution, is that 
e.xtemal conditions (to which naturalists so often appeal) do 
by themselves very little. How much they do is the point of 
all others on which I feel myself very weak. I judge from 
the facts of variation under domestication, and I may yet get 
more light. But at present, after drawing up a rough copy 
on this subject, my conclusion is that external conditions do 
extremely little, except in causing mere variability. This 
mere variability (causing the child not closely to resemble its 
parent) I look at as very different from the formation of a 
marked variety or new species. (No doubt the variability is 
governed by laws, some of which I am endeavouring very 
obscurely to trace.) The formation of a strong variety or 
species I look at as almost wholly due to the selection of 
what may be incorrectly called variations or variability. 
This power of selection stands in the most direct relation to 
time, and in the state of nature can be only excessively slow. 
Again, the slight differences selected, by which a race or 
species is at last formed, stands, as I think can be shown 
.(even with plants, and obviously with animals), in a far more 
important relation to its associates than to external conditions. 
Therefore, according to my principles, whether right or wrong, 
I cannot agree with your proposition that time, and altered 
conditions, and altered associates, are “ convertible terms." I 
look at the first and the last as far more important; time 
being important only so far as giving scope to selection. 
Cod knows whether you will perceive at what I am driving. 
I shall have to discuss and think more about your difficulty of 
the temperate and sub-arctic forms in the S. hemisphere than 
I have yet done. But I am inclined to think that I am right 
(if my general principles are right), that there would be little 
tendency to the formation of a new species, during the period 
of migration, whether shorter or longer, though considerable 
variability may have supervened. . . .

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Dec. 24th [1856]. 

. . . How I do wish I lived near you to discuss matters 
with. I have just been comparing definitions of species, and 
stating briefly how systematic naturalists work out their 
subjects. Aquilegia in the Flora Indica was a capital 
example for me. It is really laughable to see what different 
ideas are prominent in various naturalists’ minds, when they 
speak of "species in some, resemblance is everything and 
descent of little weight— in some, resemblance seems to go for 
nothing, and Creation the reigning idea — in some, descent is 
the key, — in some, sterility an unfailing test, with others it is 
not worth a farthing. It all comes, I believe, from trying to 
define the undefinable. I suppose you have lost the odd 
black seed from the birds’ dung, which germinated, — anyhow, 
it is not worth taking trouble over. I have now got about a 
dozen seeds out of small birds’ dung. Adios, 

My dear Hooker, ever yours,

My dear Dr. Gray, — I have received the second part of 
your paper,* and though I have nothing particular to say, I 
must send you my thanks and hearty admiration. The whole 
paper strikes me as quite exhausting the subject, and I quite 
fancy and flatter myself I now appreciate the character of 
your Flora. What a difference in regard to Europe your 
remark in relation to the genera makes ! I have been 
eminently glad to see your conclusion in regard to the species 
of large genera widely ranging ; it is in strict conformity with

the results I have worked out in several ways. It is of great 
importance to my notions. By the way you have paid me a 
great compliment : * to be simply mentioned even in such a 
paper I consider a very great honour. One of your con- 
clusions makes me groan, viz. that the line of connection of 
the strictly Alpine plants is through Greenland. I should 
extremely like to see your reasons published in detail, for it 
“riles” me (this is a proper expression, is it not?) dreadfully. 
Lyell told me, that Agassiz having a theory about when 
Saurians were first created, on hearing some careful observa- 
tions opposed to this, said he did not believe it, " for Nature 
never lied.” I am just in this predicament, and repeat to 
you that, “ Nature never lies,” ergo, theorisers arc always 
right . . . 

Overworked as you are, I dare say you will say that I am 
an odious plague ; but here is another suggestion 1 I was led 
by one of my wild speculations to conclude (though it has 
nothing to do with geographical distribution, yet it has with 
your statistics) that trees would have a strong tendency to have 
flowers with dioecious, moncecious or polygamous structure. 
Seeing that this seemed so in Persoon, I took one little 
British I'lora, and discriminating trees from bushes according 
to Loudon, I have found that the result was in species, genera 
and families, as I anticipated. So I sent my notions to Hooker 
to ask him to tabulate the New Zealand Flora for this end, 
and he thought my result sufficiently curious, to do so ; and 
the accordance with Britain is very striking, and the more so, 
as he made three classes of trees, bushes, and herbaceous 
plants. (He says further he shall work the Tasmanian Flora 
on the same principle.) The bushes hold an intermediate 
position between the other two classes. It seems to me a

With hearty thanks, your most troublesome friend,

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, April I2th [1857]. 

Mv DEAR Hooker, — ^Your letter has pleased me much, 
for I never can get it out of my head, that I take unfair 
advantage of your kindness, as I receive all and give nothing. 
What a splendid discussion you could write on the whole 
subject of variation 1 The cases discussed in your last note 
are valuable to me (though odious and damnable), as showing 
how profoundly ignorant we are on the causes of variation. 
I shall just allude to these cases, as a sort of sub-division 
of polymorphism a little more definite, I fancy, than the 
variation of, for instance, the Rubi, and equally or more 
perplexing. 

I have just been putting my notes together on variations 
.apparently due to the immediate and direct action of external 
causes ; and I have been struck with one result The most 
firm sticklers for independent creation admit, that the fur of 
the same species is thinner towards the south of the range of 
the same species than to the north — that the same shells are 
brighter-coloured to the south than north ; that the same 
[shell] is paler-coloured in deep water — that insects are 
smaller and darker on mountains — more livid and testaceous 
near the sea — that plants are smaller and more hairy and with 
brighter flowers on mountains: now in all such, and other 
cases, distinct species in the two zones follow the same rule, 
which seems to me to be most simply explained by species, 
being only strongly marked varieties, and therefore following

the same laws as recognised and admitted varieties. I mention 
all this on account of the variation of plants in ascending 
mountains ; I have quoted the foregoing remark only generally 
with no examples, for I add, there is so much doubt and dispute 
Avhat to call varieties ; but yet I have stumbled on so many 
casual remarks on varieties of plants on mountains being so 
characterised, that I presume there is some truth in it. What 
think you ? Do you believe there is any tendency in varieties, 
as generally so called, of plants to become more hairy, and 
with proportionally larger and brighter-coloured flowers in 
ascending a mountain ? 

I have been interested in my " weed garden,” of 3 x 2 feet 
square: I mark each seedling as it appears, and I am 
.astonished at the number that come up, and still more at 
■the number killed by slugs, &c. Already 59 have been so 
killed ; I expected a good many, but I had fancied that this 
was a less potent check than it seems to be, and I attributed 
almost exclusively to mere choking, the destruction of the 
seedlings. Grass-seedlings seem to suffer much less than 
exogens. . . , 



C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Moor Park, Farnham, [April (?) 1857.] 
My dear Hooker, — Your letter has been forwarded to 
me here, where I am undergoing hydropathy for a fortnight, 
having been here a week, and having already received an 
■amount of good which is quite incredible to myself and quite 
unaccountable. I can walk and cat like a hearty Christian, 
and even my nights are good. I cannot in the least under- 
stand how hydropathy can act as it certainly does on me. 
It dulls one’s brain splendidly ; I have not thought about 
a single species of any kind since leaving home. Your note 
has taken me aback ; I thought the hairiness, &c., of Alpine 
jpecies was generally admitted ; I am sure I have seen it

alluded to a score of times. Falconer was haranguing on 
it the other day to me. Meyen or Gay, or some such fellow 
(whom you would despise), I remember, makes some remark 
on Chilian Cordillera plants. Wimmer has written a little book 
on the same lines, and on varieties being so characterized in 
the Alps. But after writing to you, I confess I was staggered 
by finding one man (Moquin-Tandon, I think) saying that 
Alpine flowers are strongly inclined to be white, and Linmus 
saying that cold makes plants apetalous, even the same 
species ! Are Arctic plants often apetalous ? My general 
belief from my compiling work is quite to agree with what 
you say about the little direct influence of climate ; and I 
have just alluded to the hairiness of Alpine plants as an ex- 
ception. The odoriferousness would be a good case for me if 
I knew of varieties being more odoriferous in dry habitats. 

I fear that I have looked at the hairiness of Alpine plants as 
so generally acknowledged that I have not marked passages, 
so as at all to see what kind of evidence authors advance. 
I must confess, the other day, when I asked Falconer, whether 
he knew of individual plants losing or acquiring hairiness 
when transported, he did not. But now this second, my 
memory flashes on me, and I am certain I have somewhere 
got marked a case of hairy plants from the Pyrenees losing 
hairs when cultivated at Montpellier. Shall you think me 
very impudent if I tell you that I have sometimes thought 
that (quite independently of the present case), you are a little 
too hard on bad observers ; that a remark made by a bad 
observer cannot be right ; an observer who deserves to be 
damned, you would utterly damn. I feel entire deference 
to any remark you make out of your own head ; but when in 
opposition to some poor devil, I somehow involuntarily feel 
not quite so much, but yet much deference for your opinion. 
I do not know in tlie least whether there is any truth in this 
my criticism against you, but I have often thought I would 
tell you it.

I am really very much obliged for your letter, for, though I 
intended to put only one sentence and that vaguely, I should 
probably have put that much too strongly.

C. Darwin. 

P-S. — This note, as you see, has not anything requiring an 
answer. 

The distribution of fresh-water molluscs has been a horrid 
incubus to me, but I think I know my way now ; when first 
hatched they are very active, and I have had thirty or forty

and will live fifteen and even twenty-four hours out of water.

My dear Lyell, — I was glad to see in the newspapers 
about the Austrian Expedition. I have nothing to add geolo- 
gically to my notes in the Manual.* I do not know whether 
the Expedition is tied down to call at only fixed spots. But 
if there be any choice or power in the scientific men to 
influence the places — this would be most desirable. It is my 
most deliberate conviction that nothing would aid more.

though with less gusto, if I knew that my book would be 
published for ever anonymously.”] 



C. Darwin to A. R. Wallace. 

Moor Park, May 1st, 1857. 

My dear Sir, — I am much obliged for your letter of 
October 10th, from Celebes, received a few days ago ; in a 
laborious undertaking, sympathy is a valuable and real en- 
couragement. By your letter and even still more by your 
paper * in the Annals, a year or more ago, I can plainly see 
that we have thought much alike and to a certain extent have 
come to similar conclusions. In regard to the Paper in the 
Annals, I agree to the truth of almost every word of your 
paper ; and I dare say that you will agree with me that it is 
very rare to find oneself agreeing pretty closely with any 
theoretical paper ; for it is lamentable how each man draws 
his own different conclusions from the very same facts. This 
summer will make the 20th year (!) since I opened my first 
note-book, on the question how and in what way do species- 
and varieties differ from each other. I am now preparing my 
work for publication, but I find the subject so very large, that 
though I have written many chapters, I do not suppose I 
shall go to press for two years. I have never heard how long 
you intend staying in the Malay Archipelago ; I wish I might 
profit by the publication of your Travels there before my 
work appears, for no doubt you will reap a large harvest of 
facts. I have acted already in accordance with your advice 
of keeping domestic varieties, and those appearing in a state 
of nature, distinct ; but I have sometimes doubted of the. 
wisdom of this, and therefore I am glad to be backed by your 
opinion. I must confess, however, I rather doubt the truth

of the now very prevalent doctrine of all our domestic animals 
having descended from several wild stocks ; though I do not 
doubt that it is so in some cases. I think there is rather 
better evidence on the sterility of hybrid animals than you 
seem to admit : and in regard to plants the collection of 
carefully recorded facts by Kolreuter and Gaertner (and 
Herbert) is enormous. I most entirely agree with you on the 
little effects of “ climatal conditions,” which one sees referred 
to ad nauseam in all books ; I suppose some very little effect 
must be attributed to such influences, but I fully believe that 
they are very slight It is really impossible to explain my 
views (in the compass of a letter), on the causes and means of 
variation in a state of nature ; but I have slowly adopted a 
distinct and tangible idea, — whether true or false others must 
judge : for the firmest conviction of the truth of a doctrine by 
its author, seems, alas, not to be the slightest guarantee of 
truth 1 . . . 

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker' 

Moor Park, Saturday [May and, 1857]. 

Mv DEAR Hooker, — You have shaved the hair off the 
Alpine plants pretty effectually. The case of the Anthyllis 
will make a ‘‘ tie ” with the believed case of Pyrenees plants 
becoming glabrous at low levels. K I do find that I have 
marked such facts, I will lay the evidence before you. 
I wonder how the belief could have originated I Was it 
through final causes to keep the plants warm ? Falconer in 
talk coupled the two facts of woolly Alpine plants and 
mammals. How candidly and meekly you took my Jeremiad 
on your severity to second-class men. After I had sent 
it off, an ugly little voice asked me, once or twice, how much 
of my noble defence of the poor in spirit and in fact, was 
owing to your having not seldom smashed favourite notions 
of my own. I silenced the ugly little voice with contempt, 
but it would whisper again and again. I sometimes despise

myself as a poor compiler as heartily as you could do, though 
I do not despise my whole work, as I think there is enough 
known to lay a foundation for the discussion on the origin of 
species. I have been led to despise and laugh at myself 
as a compiler, for having put down that “ Alpine plants have 
large flowers,” and now perhaps I may write over these very 
ivords, “ Alpine plants have small or apctalous flowers 1 ” . , . 



C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down [May] i6th [1857]. 

My dear Hooker, — ^You said — I hope honestly — that 
you did not dislike my asking questions on general points, 
you of course answering or not as time and inclination 
might serve. I And in the animal kingdom that .... 
any part or organ developed normally, {Le. not a mon- 
strosity) in a species in any high or unusual degree, com- 
pared with the same part or organ in allied species, tends 
to be highly variable. I cannot doubt this from my mass 
of collected facts. To give an instance, the Cross-bill is very 
abnormal in the structure of its bill compared with other 
allied Fringillidae, and the beak is eminently variable. The 
Himantopus, remarkable from the wonderful length of its legs, 
is very variable in the length of its legs. I could give many 
most striking and curious illustrations in all classes ; so many 
that I think it cannot be chance. But I have none in the 
\‘egetable kingdom, owing, as I believe, to my ignorance. 
If Nepenthes consisted of one or two species in a group with 
a pitcher developed, then I should have expected it to have 
been very variable ; but I do not consider Nepenthes a case 
in point, for when a whole genus or group has an ot^^, 
however anomalous, I do not expect it to be variable, — 
it is only when one or few species differ greatly in some one 
part or organ from the forms closely allied to it in all other 
respects, that I believe such part or organ to be highly vari-

able. Will you turn this in your mind ? it is an important 
apparent law (!) for me. 

Ever yours, 

C. Darwin. 

P.S. — 1 do not know how far you will care to hear, but 
I find Moquin-Tandon treats in his ‘Teratologic ’ on villosity 
of- plants, and seems to attribute more to dryness than 
altitude ; but seems to think that it must be admitted that 
mountain plants are villose, and that this villosity is only 
in part explained by De Candolle’s remark that the dwarfed 
condition of mountain plants would condense the hairs, and 
so give them the appearance of being more hairy. He quotes- 
Senebier, ‘Physiologic Vdgdtale,’ as authority — I suppose 
the first authority, for mountain plants being hairy. 

If I could show positively that the endemic species were- 
more hairy in dry districts, then the case of the varieties- 
becoming more hairy in dry ground would be a fact for me. 

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, June 3rd [1857]. 

My dear Hooker, — I am going to enjoy myself by 
having a prose on my own subjects to you, and this is a 
greater enjoyment to me than you will readily understand, as 
I for months together do not open my mouth on Natural 
History. Your letter is of great value to me, and staggers me 
in regard to my proposition. I dare say the absence of 
botanical facts may in part be accounted for by the difficulty 
of measuring slight variations. Indeed, after writing, this 
occurred to me ; for I have Cruciatuila stylosa coming into- 
flower, and the pistil ought to be very variable in length, and 
thinking of this I at once felt how could one judge whether it 
was variable in any high degree. How different, for instance, 
from the beak of a bird ! But I am not satisfied with this ex- 
planation, and am staggered. Yet I think there is something 



i857-] variability. 99 

in the law ; I have had so many instances, as the following : 
I wrote to Wollaston to ask him to run through the Madeira 
Beetles and tell me whether any one presented anything very 
anomalous in relation to its allies. He gave me a unique case 
of an enormous head in a female, and then I found in his book, 
already stated, that the size of the head was astonishingly 
variable. Part of the difference with plants may be accounted 
for by many of my cases being secondary male or female 
characters but then I have striking cases with hermaphrodite 
Cirripedes. The cases seem to mo far too numerous for 
accidental coincidences of great variability and abnormal de- 
velopment I presume that you will not object to my put- 
ting a note saying that you had reflected over the case, and 
though one or two cases seemed to support, quite as many 
or more seemed wholly contradictory. This want of evidence is 
the more surprising to me, as generally I find any proposition 
more easily tested by observations in botanical works, which 
I have picked up, than in zoological works. I never dreamed 
that you had kept the subject at all before your mind. Alto- 
gether the case is one more of my many horrid puzzles. My 
obseivations, though on so infinitely a small scale, on the 
struggle for existence, begin to make me see a little clearer 
how the fight goes on. Out of sixteen kinds of seed sown on 
my meadow, fifteen have germinated, but now they are 
perishing at such a rate that I doubt whether more than one 
will flower. Here we have choking which has taken place 
likewise on a great scale, with plants not seedlings, in a bit of 
my lawn allowed to grow up. On the other hand, in a bit of 
ground, 2 by 3 feet, I have daily marked each seedling weed 
as it has appeared during March, April and May, and 357 have 
come up, and of these 277 have already been killed, chiefly by 
slugs. By the way, at Moor Park, I saw rather a pretty case 
of the effects of animals on vegetation : there are enormous 
commons with clumps of old Scotch firs on the hills, and 
about eight or ten years ago some of these commons were

enclosed, and all round the clumps nice young trees are 
springing up by the million, looking exactly as if planted, so 
many are of the same age. In other parts of the common, not 
yet enclosed, I looked for miles and not one young tree could 
be seen. I then went near (within quarter of a mile of the 
clumps) and looked closely in the heather, and there I found 
tens of thousands of young Scotch firs (thirty in one square 
yard) with their tops nibbled off by the few cattle which 
occasionally roam over these wretched heaths. One little tree, 
three inches high, by the rings appeared to be twenty-six years 
old, with a short stem about as thick as a stick of sealing-wax. 
What a wondrous problem it is, what a play of forces, determi- 
ning the kind and proportion of each plant in a square yard 
of turf ! It is to my mind truly wonderful. And yet we are 
pleased to wonder when some animal or plant becomes 
extinct 

I am so sorry that you will not be at the Club. I see Mrs. 
Hooker is going to Yarmouth ; I trust that the health of your 
children is not the motive. Good-bye.

Down, June 5 [1857]. 

My dear Hooker, — I honour your conscientious care 
about the medals.* Thank God I I am only an amateur (but 
a much interested one) on the subject. 

It is an old notion of mine that more good is done by giving 
medals to younger men in the early part of their career, than as 
a mere reward to men whose scientific career is nearly finished. 
Whether medals ever do any good is a question which does

not concern us, as there the medals are. I am almost inclined 
to think that I would rather lower the standard, and give 
medals to young workers than to old ones with no especial 
claims. With regard to especial claims, I think it just 
deserving your attention, that if general claims are once 
admitted, it opens the door to great laxity in giving them. 
Think of the case of a very rich man, who aided solely with 
his money, but to a grand extent — or such an inconceivable 
prodigy as a minister of the Crown who really cared for 
science. Would you give such men medals? Perhaps 
medals could not be better applied than exclusively to such 
men. I confess at present I incline to stick to especial claims 
which can be put down on paper. . . . 

I am much confounded by your showing that there are not 
obvious instances of my (or rather Waterhouse’s) law of 
abnormal developments being highly variable. I have been 
thinking more of your remark about the difficulty of judging 
or comparing variability in plants from the great general 
variability of parts. I should look at the law as more com- 
pletely smashed if you would turn in your mind for a little 
while for cases of great variability of an organ, and tell me 
whether it is moderately easy to pick out such cases ; for if 
they can be picked out, and, notwithstanding, do not coincide 
with great or abnormal development, it would be a complete 
smasher. It is only beginning in your mind at the variability 
end of the question instead of at the abnormality end. Per- 
haps cases in which a part is highly variable in all the species 
of a group should be excluded, as possibly being something 
distinct, and connected with the perplexing subject of poly- 
morphism. Will you perfect your assistance by further 
considering, for a little, the subject this way ? 

I have been so much interested this morning in comparing 
all my notes on the variation of the several species of the genus 
Equus and the results of their crossing. Taking most strictly 
analogous facts amongst the blessed pigeons for my guide,

My dear Lubbock, — You have done me the greatest 
possible service in helping me to clarify my brains. If I am 
as muzzy on all subjects as I am on proportion and chance, 
— what a book I shall produce 1 

I have divided the New Zealand Flora as you suggested. 
There are 339 species in genera of 4 and upwards, and 323 in 
genera of 3 and less. 

The 339 species have 51 species presenting one .or more 
varieties. The 323 species have only 37. Proportionately 
(339 : 323 :: 51 : 48'5) they ought to have had 484 species 
presenting vars. So that the case goes as I want it, but not 
strong enough, without it be general, for me to have much 
confidence in. I am quite convinced yours is the right way : 
I had thought of it, but should never have done it had it not 
been for my most fortunate conversation with you. 

I am quite shocked to find how easily I am muddled, for I 
had before thought over the subject much, and concluded my 
way was fair. It is dreadfully erroneous. 

What a disgraceful blunder you have saved me from. I 
heartily thank you.

will come here between nth and 15th! Is not that grand? 
Many thanks about Fumrohr. I must humbly supplicate 
Kippist to search for it : he most kindly got Borcau for me. 

I am got extremely interested in tabulating, according to 
mere size of genera, the species having any varieties marked 
by Greek letters or otherwise : the result (as far as I have yet 
gone) seems to me one of the most important arguments I 
have yet met with, that varieties are only small species — or 
species only strongly marked varieties. The subject is in 
many ways so very important for me ; I wish much you would 
think of any well-worked Floras with from 1000-2000 species, 
with the varieties marked. It is good to have hair-splitters 
and lumpers.* I have done, or am doing : —

Has not Koch published a good German Flora? Does he

The Floras ought to be well known.

make few are the “ lumpers.”

C. Darwin to Asa Gray. 

Down, Feb. list [1859]. 

My dear Gray, — My last letter begged no favour, this 
one does : but it will really cost you very little trouble to 
answer me, and it will be of very great service to me, 
owing to a remark made to me by Hooker, which I cannot 
credit, and which was suggested to him by one of my letters. 
He suggested my asking you, and I told him I would not 
give the least hint what he thought. I generally believe 
Hooker implicitly, but he is sometimes, I think, and he 
confesses it, rather over-critical, and his ingenuity in discover- 
ing flaws seems to me admirable. Here is my question : — 
■“ Do you think that good botanists in drawing up a local 
Flora, whether small or large, or in making a Prodromus like 
Do Candolle’s, would almost universally, but unintentionally 
and unconsciously, tend to record {i.e. marking with Greek 
letters and giving short characters) varieties in the large or 
in the small genera ? Or would the tendency be to record the 
varieties about equally in genera of all sizes ? Are you your- 
self conscious on reflection that you have attended to, and 
recorded more carefully the varieties in large or small, or very 
small genera ? ” 

I know what fleeting and trifling things varieties very often 
are ; but my query applies to such as have been thought 
worth marking and recording. If you could screw time to 
send me ever so brief an answer to this, pretty soon, it would 
be a great service to me. 

Yours most truly obliged, 

Ch. Darwin.

1857] LARGE GENERA VARYING. 10 / 

P.S. — Do you know whether any one has ever published 
any remarks on the geographical range of varieties of plants 
in comparison with the species to which they are supposed to 
belong? I have in vain tried to get some vague idea, and 
with the exception of a little information on this head given 
me by Mr. Watson in a paper on Land Shells in U. States, 
I have quite failed ; but perhaps it would be difficult for you 
to give me even a brief answer on this head, and if so I am 
not so unreasonable, / assure you, as to expect it 

If you are writing to England soon, you could enclose other 
Jotters [for] me to forward. 

Please observe, the question is not whether there are more 
or fewer varieties in larger or smaller genera, but whether 
there is a stronger or weaker tendency in the minds of 
botanists to record such in large or small genera. 



C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker, 

Down, May 6th [1858]. 

... I send by this post my MS. on the “ commonness,” 
““ range,” and “ variation ” of species in large and small genera. 
You have undertaken a horrid job in so very kindly offering 
to read it, and I thank you warmly. I have just corrected 
the copy, and am disappointed in finding how tough and 
obscure it is ; but I cannot make it clearer, and at present I 
loathe the very sight of it. The style of course requires 
further correction, and if published I must try, but as yet see 
not how, to make it clearer. 

If you have much to say and can have patience to consider 
the whole subject, I would meet you in London on the Phil. Club 
day, so as to save you the trouble of writing. For Heaven’s 
sake, you stem and awful judge and sceptic, remember that 
my conclusions may be true, notwithstanding that Botanists 
may have recorded more varieties in large than in small

Again I thank you most sincerely, but I fear you will find it 
a horrid job.

and 1858.] 

C. Darwin to A. R. Wallace. 

Down, Dec. 22nd, 1857. 

My dear Sir, — I thank you for your letter of Sept 27th. 

I am extremely glad to hear that you are attending to distri- 
bution in accordance with theoretical ideas. I am a firm 
believer that without speculation there is no good and original 
observation. Few travellers have attended to such points as 
you are now at work on ; and, indeed, the whole subject of , 
distribution of animals is dreadfully behind that of plants. 
You say that you have been somewhat surprised at no notice 
having been taken of your paper in the Annals.* I cannot say 
that I am, for so very few naturalists care for anything beyond 
the mere description of species. But you must not suppose 
that your paper has not been attended to : two very good 
men. Sir C. Lyell, and Mr. E. Blyth at Calcutta, specially 
called my attention to it Though agreeing with you on your 
conclusions in that paper, I believe I go much further than 
you ; but it is too long a subject to enter on my speculative 
notions. I have not yet seen your paper on the distribution 
of animals in the Aru Islands. I shall read it with the 
utmost interest ; for I think that the most interesting quarter 
of the whole globe in respect to distribution, and I have long 
been very imperfectly trying to collect data for the Malay 
Archipelago. I shall be quite prepared to subscribe to your

doctrine of subsidence ; indeed, from the quite independent 
evidence of the Coral Reefs I coloured my original map (in my 
Coral volume) of the Aru Islands as one of subsidence, but 
got frightened and left it uncoloured. But I can see that you 
are inclined to go much further than I am in regard to the 
former connection of oceanic islands with continents. Ever 
since poor E. Forbes propounded this doctrine, it has been 
eagerly followed ; and Hooker elaborately discusses the 
former connection of all the Antarctic Islands and New Zea- 
land and South America. About a year ago I discussed this 
subject much with Lyell and Hooker (for I shall have to treat 
of it), and wrote out my arguments in opposition ; but you 
will be glad to hear that neither Lyell nor Hooker thought 
much of my arguments. Nevertheless, for once in my life, 
I dare withstand the almost preternatural sagacity of Lyell. 

You ask about land-shells on islands far distant from con- 
tinents : Madeira has a few identical with those of Europe, 
and here the evidence is really good, as some of them are sub- 
fossil. In the Pacific Islands there are cases of identity, which 
I cannot at present persuade myself to account for by intro- 
duction through man’s agency ; although Dr. Aug. Gould has 
conclusively shown that many land-shells have thus been 
distributed over the Pacific by man’s agency. These cases of 
introduction are most plaguing. Have you not found it so in 
the Malay Archipelago? It has seemed to me in the lists of 
mammals of Timor and other islands, that several in all pro- 
bability have been naturalised. . . . 

You ask whether I shall discuss “man.” I think I shall 
avoid the whole subject, as so surrounded with prejudices ; 
though I fully admit that it is the highest and most interesting 
problem for the naturalist. My work, on which I have now 
been at work more or less for twenty years, will not fix or 
settle anything ; but I hope it will aid by giving a large col- 
lection of facts, with one definite end. I get on very slowly, 
partly from ill-health, partly from being a very slow worker.

C. Darwin to W. D. Fox. 

Down, April i6th [185S]. 

My dear Fox, — I want you to observe one point for me, 
on which I am extremely much interested, and which will give 
you no trouble beyond keeping your eyes open, and that is a 
habit I know full well that you have. 

I find horses of various colours often have a spinal band or 
stripe of different and darker tint than the rest of the body ; 
rarely transverse bars on the legs, generally on the under-side 
of the front legs, still more rarely a very faint transverse 
shoulder-stripe like an ass. 

Is there any breed of Delamere forest ponies? I have 
found out little about ponies in these respects. Sir P. Egerton 
has, I believe, some quite thoroughbred chestnut horses ; have 
any of them the spinal stripe? Mouse-coloured ponies, or 
rather small horses, often have spinal and leg bars. So have 
dun horses (by dun I mean real colour of cream mixed with 
brown, bay, or chestnut). So have sometimes chestnuts, but I 
have not yet got a case of spinal stripe in chestnut, race horse, 
or in quite heavy cart-horse. Any fact of this nature of such 
stripes in horses would be most useful to me. There is a

parallel case in the legs of the donkey, and I have collected 
some most curious cases of stripes appearing in various 
crossed equine animals. I have also a large mass of parallel 
facts in the breeds of pigeons about the wing bars. I suspect 
it will throw light on the colour of the primeval horse. So 
do help me if occasion turns up. . . . My health has been 
lately very bad from ovei^vork, and on Tuesday I go for a

... I have just had the innermost cockles of my heart 
rejoiced by a letter from Lyell. I said to him (or he to me) 
that I believed from the character of the flora of the Azores, 
that icebergs must have been stranded there ; and that I ex- 
pected erratic boulders would be detected embedded between 
the upheaved lava-beds ; and I got Lyell to write to Hartung 
to ask, and now H. says my question explains what had 
astounded him, viz. large boulders (and some polished) of 
mica-schist, quartz, sandstone, &c., some embedded, and some 
40 and 50 feet above the level of the sea, so that he had 
inferred that they had not been brought as ballast. Is this 
not beautiful ?

horrid state. I am extremely much obliged to you for send- 
ing me Hartung’s interesting letter. The erratic boulders are 
splendid. It is a grand case of floating ice versus glaciers. 
He ought to have compared the northern and southern shores 
of the islands. It is eminently interesting to me, for I have 
written a very long chapter on the subject, collecting briefly 
all the geological evidence of glacial action in different parts 
of the world, and then at great length (on the theory of species 
changing) I have discussed the migration and modification of 
plants and animals, in sea and land, over a large part of the 
world. To my mind, it throws a flood of light on the whole 
subject of distribution, if combined with the modification of 
species. Indeed, I venture to speak with some little con- 
fidence on this, for Hooker, about a year ago, kindly read 
over my chapter, and though he then demurred gravely to 
the general conclusion, I was delighted to hear a week or two 
ago that he was inclined to come round pretty strongly to my 
views of distribution and change during the glacial period. I 
had a letter from Thompson, of Calcutta, the other day, which 
helps me much, as he is making out for me what heat our 
temperate plants can endure. But it is too long a subject for 
a note ; and I have written thus only because Hartung’s note 
has set the whole subject afloat in my mind again. But I 
will write no more, for my object here is to think about 
nothing, bathe much, walk much, eat much, and read much 
novels. Farewell, with many thanks, and very kind remem- 
brance to Lady Lyell. 

Ever yours,

and enjoyed myself — the fresh yet dark-green of the grand 
Scotch firs, the brown of the catkins of the old birches, with 
their white stems, and a fringe of distant green from the 
larches, made an excessively pretty view. At last I fell fast 
asleep on the grass, and awoke with a chorus of birds singing 
around me, and squirrels running up the trees, and some 
woodpeckers laughing, and it was as pleasant and rural a 
scene as ever I saw, and I did not care one penny how any of 
the beasts or birds had been formed. I sat in the drawing- 
room till after eight, and then went and read the Chief 
Justice’s summing up, and thought Bernard * guilty, and then 
read a bit of my novel, which is feminine, virtuous, clerical, 
philanthropical, and all that sort of thing, but very decidedly 
flat. I say feminine, for the author is ignorant about money 
matters, and not much of a lady — for she makes her men say, 
“ My Lady.” I like Miss Craik very much, though we have 
some battles, and differ on every subject I like also the 
Hungarian ; a thorough gentleman, formerly attache at Paris, 
and then in the Austrian cavalry, and now a pardoned exile, 
with broken health. He does not seem to like Kossuth, but

THE WRITING OF THE ‘ORIGIN OF SPECIES. 

JUNE l8, 1858, TO NOVEMBER 1859. 

'[The letters given in the present chapter tell their story with 
sufficient clearness, and need but a few words of explanation. 
Mr. Wallace’s Essay, referred to in the first letter, bore the 
title, ‘ On the Tendency of Varieties to depart indefinitely 
from the Original Type,’ and was published in the Linnean 
Society’s ‘Journal’ (1858, vol. iii. p. 53) as part of the joint 
paper of “ Messrs. C. Darwin and A. Wallace,” of which the 
full title was ‘ On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties ; 
and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural 
Means of Selection.’ 

My father’s contribution of the paper consisted of (i) Ex- 
tracts from the sketch of 1844; (2) part of a letter addressed 
to Dr. Asa Gray, dated September 5, 1857, and which is 
given at p. 1 20. The paper was “ communicated ” to the 
Society by Sir Charles Lyell and Sir Joseph Hooker, in 
whose prefatory letter, a clear account of the circumstances 
■of the case is given. 

Referring to Mr. Wallace’s Essay, they wrote ; — 

“So highly did Mr. Darwin appreciate the value of the 
views therein set forth, that he proposed, in a letter to Sir 
Charles Lyell, to obtain Mr. Wallace’s consent to allow the 
Essay to be published as soon as possible. Of this step we 
highly approved, provided Mr. Danvin did not withhold from 
the public, as he was strongly inclined to do (in favour of

Mr. Wallace), the memoir which he had himself written on 
the same subject, and which, as before stated, one of us had 
perused in 1844, and the contents of which we had both of 
us been privy to for many years. On representing this to 
Mr. Darwin, he gave us permission to make what use we 
thought proper of his memoir, &c. ; and in adopting our 
present course, of presenting it to the Linnean Society, we 
have explained to him that we are not solely considering the 
relative claims to priority of himself and his friend, but the 
interests of science generally.”] 



LETTERS. 

C. Darwin to C. Lyell. 

Down, 18th [June 1858]. 

My DEAR Lyell, — Some year or so ago you recommended 
me to read a paper by Wallace in the ‘Annals,’ * which had 
interested you, and, as I was writing to him, I knew this 
would please him much, so I told him. He has to-day sent 
me the enclosed, and asked me to forward it to you. It seems 
to me well worth reading. Your words have come true with a 
vengeance — that I should be forestalled. You said this, when 
I explained to you here very briefly my views of ‘ Natural 
Selection ’ depending on the struggle for existence. I never 
saw a more striking coincidence ; if Wallace had my MS. 
sketch written out in 1842, he could not have made a better 
short abstract I Even his terms now stand as heads of my 
chapters. Please return me the MS., which he does not say 
he wishes me to publish, but I shall, of course, at once write 
and offer to send to any journal. So all my originality, what- 
ever it may amount to, will be smashed, though my book,

if it will ever have any value, will not be deteriorated ; as all 
the labour consists in the application of the theory, 

I hope you will approve of Wallace’s sketch, that I may 
tell him what you say. 

My dear Lyell, yours most truly, 

C. Darwin. 



C. Darwin to C. Lyell. 

Down, Friday [June 25, 1858]. 

My dear Lyell, — I am very sorry to trouble you, busy 
as you are, in so merely personal an aHair ; but if you will 
give me your deliberate opinion, you will do me as great a 
service as ever man did, for I have entire confidence in your 
judgment and honour. . . . 

There is nothing in Wallace’s sketch which is not written 
out much fuller in my sketch, copied out in 1844, and leAd by 
Hooker some dozen years ago. About a year «^o I sent a 
short sketch, of which I have a copy, of my views (owing to 
correspondence on several points) to Asa Gray, so that I could 
most truly say and prove that I take nothing from Wallace. 
I should be extremely glad now to publish a sketch of my 
general views in about a dozen pages or so ; but I cannot 
persuade myself that I can do so honourably. Wallace says 
nothing about publication, and I enclose his letter. But as I 
had not intended to publish any sketch, can I do so honourably, 
because Wallace has sent me an outline of his doctrine ? I 
would far rather bum my whole book, than that he or any 
other man should think that I had behaved in a paltry spirit 
Do you not think his having sent me this sketch ties my 
hands? .... If I could honourably publish, I would state 
that I was induced now to publish a sketch (and I should be 
very glad to be permitted to say, to follow your advice long 
ago given) from Wallace having sent me an outline of my 
general conclusions. We differ only, [in] that I was led to my

views from what artificial selection has done for domestic 
animals. I would send Wallace a copy of my letter to Asa 
Gray, to show him that I had not stolen his doctrine. But 1 
cannot tell whether to publish now would not be base and 
paltry. This was my first impression, and I should have 
certainly acted on it had it not been for your letter. 

This is a trumpery affair to trouble you with, but you 
cannot tell how much obliged I should be for your advice. 

By the way, would you object to send this and your answer 
to Hooker to be fortvarded to me, for then I shall have the 
opinion of my two best and kindest friends. This letter 
is miserably written, and I write it now, that I may for 
a time banish the whole subject ; and I am worn out with 
musing . . . 

My good dear friend, forgive me. This is a trumpery letter,, 
influenced by trumpery feelings. 

Yours most truly, 

C. Darwin. 

I will never trouble you or Hooker on the subject again. 



C. Darwin to C. Lyell. 

Down, 26th [June 1858]. 

Mv DEAR Lyell, — Forgive me for adding a P.S. to make 
the case as strong as possible against myself. 

Wallace might say, “You did not intend publishing an 
abstract of your views till you received my communication. 
Is it fair to take advantage of my having freely, though 
unasked, communicated to you my ideas, and thus prevent 
me forestalling you ? ’’ The advantage which I should take 
being that I am induced to publish from privately knowing 
that Wallace is in the field. It seems hard on me that I 
should be thus compelled to lose my priority of many years’ 
standing, but I cannot feel at all sure that this alters the

justice of the case. First impressions are generally right, and 
I at first thought it would be dishonourable in me now to 
publish. 

Yours most truly, 

C. Darwin.

Lord Chancellor ; and I now appeal to you as a Lord 
Chancellor.

had not strongly enhanced this feeling. But I did not feel in

that you would think me worth no more notice or assistance. 
To give one example : the last time I saw my dear old friend 
Falconer, he attacked me most vigorously, but quite kindly, 
and told me, “You will do more harm than any ten Naturalists 
will do good. I can see that you have already corrupted and 
half-spoiled Hooker 1 ! ’’ Now when I see such strong feeling 
in my oldest friends, you need not wonder that I always ex- 
pect my views to be received with contempt But enough and 
too much of thi.s. 

I thank you most truly for the kind spirit of your last letter. 
I agree to every word in it, and think I go as far as almost 
any one in seeing the grave difficulties against my doctrine. 
With respect to the extent to which I go, all the arguments 
in favour of my notions fall rapidly away, the greater the scope 
of forms considered. But in animals, embryology leads me to 
an enormous and frightful range. The facts which kept me 
longest scientifically orthodox are those of adaptation — the 
pollen-masses in asclcpias — the mistletoe, with its pollen 
carried by insects, and seed by birds — the woodpecker, with 
its feet and tail, beak and tongue, to climb the tree and secure 
insects. To talk of climate or Lamarckian habit producing 
such adaptations to other organic beings is futile. This diffi- 
culty I believe I have surmounted. As you seem interested 
in the subject, and as it is an immense advantage to me to 
write to you and to hear, ever so briefly, what you think, 
I will enclose (copied, so as to save you trouble in reading) 
the briefest abstract of my notions on the means by which 
Nature makes her species. Why I think that species have 
really changed, depends on general facts in the affinities, 
embryology, rudimentary organs, geological history, and geo-

graphical distribution of organic beings. In regard to my 
Abstract, you must take immensely on trust, each paragraph 
occupying one or two chapters in my book. You will, 
perhaps, think it paltry in me, when I ask you not to mention 
my doctrine ; the reason is, if any one, like the author of the 
‘ Vestiges,’ were to hear of them, he might easily work them 
in, and then I should have to quote from a work perhaps 
despised by naturalists, and this would greatly injure any 
chance of my views being received by those alone whose 
opinions I value. [Here follows a discussion on “large 
genera varying,” which has no direct connection with the 
remainder of the letter.] 

I. It is wonderful what the principle of Selection by Man, 
that is the picking out of individuals with any desired quality, 
and breeding from them, and again picking out, can do. 
Even breeders have been astonished at their own results. 
They can act on differences inappreciable to an uneducated 
eye. Selection has been metlwdically followed in Europe for 
only the last half century. But it has occasionally, and even 
in some degree methodically, been followed in the most 
ancient times. There must have been also a kind of uncon- 
scious selection from the most ancient times, namely, in the 
preservation of the individual animals (without any thought of 
their offspring) most useful to each race of man in his par- 
ticular circumstances. The “ roguing,” as nursery-men call the 
destroying of varieties, which depart from their type, is a kind 
of selection. I am convinced that intentional and occasional 
selection has been the main agent in making our domestic 
races. But, however this may be, its great power of modifi- 
cation has been indisputably shown in late times. Selection 
acts only by the accumulation of very slight or greater 
variations, caused by external conditions, or by the mere 
fact that in generation the child is not absolutely similar to 
its parent. Man, by this power of accumulating variations, 
adapts living beings to his wants — he may be said to make

GRAY.

the wool of one sheep good for carpets, and another for 
cloth, &c. 

II. Now, suppose there was a being, who did not judge by- 
mere external appearance, but could study the whole internal 
organisation — who never was capricious — who should go on 
selecting for one end during millions of generations, who will 
say what he might not effect 1 In nature we have some slight 
variations, occasionally in all parts ; and I think it can be 
shown that a change in the conditions of existence is the 
main cause of the child not exactly resembling its parents ; 
and in nature, geology shows us what changes have taken 
place, and are taking place. We have almost unlimited time ; 
no one but a practical geologist can fully appreciate this : 
think of the Glacial period, during the whole of which the 
same species of shells at least have existed ; there must 
have been during this period, millions on millions of 
generations. 

III. I think it can be shown that there is such an unerring 
power at work, or Natural Selection (the title of my book), 
which selects exclusively for the good of each organic being. 
The elder De Candolle, W. Herbert, and Lyell, have written 
strongly on the struggle for life; but even they have not 
written strongly enough. Reflect that every being (even the 
elephant) breeds at such a rate that, in a few years, or at most 
a few centuries or thousands of years, the surface of the earth 
would not hold the progeny of any one species. I have found 
it hard constantly to bear in mind that the increase of every 
single species is checked during some part of its life, or during 
some shortly recurrent generation. Only a few of those 
annually born can live to propagate their kind. What a 
trifling difference must often determine which shall survive 
and which perish 1 

IV. Now take the case of a country undergoing some 
change ; this will tend to cause some of its inhabitants to vary 
slightly ; not but what I believe most beings vary at all times 



© The Comolete Work of Charles Darwin Online 



124 the writing of the ‘origin of species.’ [1858. 

enough for selection to act on. Some of its inhabitants will 
be exterminated, and the remainder will be exposed to the 
mutual action of a different set of inhabitants, which I believe 
to be more important to the life of each being than mere 
climate. Considering the infinitely various ways beings have 
to obtain food by struggling with other beings, to escape 
danger at various times of life, to have their eggs or seeds 
disseminated, &c. &c., I cannot doubt that during millions of 
generations individuals of a species will be born with some 
slight variation profitable to some part of its economy ; such 
will have a better chance of surviving, propagating this varia- 
tion, which again will be slowly increased by the accumulative 
action of natural selection ; and the variety thus formed will 
either coexist with, or more commonly will exterminate its 
parent form. An organic being like the woodpecker, or 

the mistletoe, may thus come to be adapted to a score of 
contingencies ; natural selection, accumulating those slight 
variations in all parts of its structure which are in any way 
useful to it, during any part of its life. 

V. Multiform difficulties will occur to every one on this 
theory. Most can, I think, be satisfactorily answered. — 

Natura non facit saltum ” answer some of the most obvi- 
ous. The slowness of the change, and only a very few under- 
going change at any one time answers others. The extreme 
imperfections of our geological records answer others. 

VI. One other principle, which maybe called the principle 
of divergence, plays, I believe, an important part in the origin 
of species. The same spot will support more life if occupied 
by very diverse forms : we see this in the many generic forms 
in a square yard of turf (I have counted twenty species 
belonging to eighteen genera), or in the plants and insects, 
on any little uniform islet, belonging to almost as many 
genera and families as to species. We can understand this 
with the higher animals, whose habits we best understand. 
We know that it has been experimentally shown that a plot 



1858.] THE LETTER TO DR. GRAY. 12$ 

of land will yield a greater weight, if cropped with several 
species of grasses, than with two or three species. Now every 
single organic being, by propagating rapidly, may be said to 
be striving its utmost to increase in numbers. So it will be 
with the offspring of any species after it has broken into 
varieties, or sub-species, or true species. And it follows, I 
think, from the foregoing facts, that the varying offspring of 
each species will try (only few will succeed) to seize on as 
many and as diverse places in the economy of nature as 
possible. Each new variety or species when formed will 
generally take the place of, and so exterminate its less well- 
fitted parent This, I believe, to be the origin of the classifi- 
cation or arrangement of all organic beings at all times. 
These always seem to branch and sub-branch like a tree 
from a common trunk ; the flourishing twigs destroying the 
less vigorous — the dead and lost branches rudely representing 
extinct genera and families. 

This sketch is most imperfect ; but in so short a space I 
cannot make it better. Your imagination must fill up many 
wide blanks. Without some reflection, it will appear all 
rubbish ; perhaps it will appear so after reflection. 

C. D. 

P.S. — This little abstract touches only the accumulative 
power of natural selection, which I look at as by far the most 
important element in the production of new forms. The laws 
governing the incipient or primordial variation (unimportant 
except as the groundwork for selection to act on, in which 
respect it is all important), I shall discuss under several 
heads, but I can come, as you may well believe, only to very 
partial and imperfect conclusions. 

[The joint paper of Mr. Wallace and my father was read at 
the Linnean Society on the evening of July ist Sir Charles 
Lyell and Sir J. D. Hooker were present, and both, I believe, 
made a few remarks, chiefly with a view of impressing on those

present the necessity of giving the most careful consideration 
to what they had heard. There was, however, no semblance 
of a discussion. Sir Joseph Hooker writes to me: “The 
interest excited was intense, but the subject was too novel 
and too ominous for the old school to enter the lists, before 
armouring. After the meeting it was talked over with bated 
breath : Lyell’s approval, and perhaps in a small way mine, 
as his lieutenant in the affair, rather overawed the Fellows, 
who would otherwise have flown out against the doctrine. 
We had, too, the vantage ground of being familiar with the 
authors and their theme.”] 

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, July 5th [1858]. 

My dear Hooker, — ^We are become more happy and 
less panic-struck, now that we have sent out of the house 
every child, and shall remove H., as soon as she can move. 
The first nurse became ill with ulcerated throat and quinsy, 
and the second is now ill with the scarlet fever, but, thank 
God, is recovering. You may imagine how frightened we 
have been. It has been a most miserable fortnight. Thank- 
you much for your note, telling me that all had gone on 
prosperously at the Linnean Society. You must let me once 
again tell you how deeply I feel your generous kindness and 
Lyell’s on this occasion. But in truth it shames me that 
you should have lost time on a mere point of priority. I 
shall be curious to see the proofs. I do not in the least 
understand whether my letter to A. Gray is to be printed ; 
I suppose not, only your note ; but I am quite indifferent, 
and place myself absolutely in your and Lyell’s hands. 

1 can easily prepare an abstract of my whole work, but I 
can hardly see how it can be made scientific for a Journal, 
without giving facts, which would be impossible. Indeed, a 
mere abstract cannot be very short Could you give mo any

idea how many pages of the Journal could probably bo spared 

Directly after my return home, I would begin and cut my 
cloth to my measure. If the Referees were to reject it as not 
strictly scientific, I could, perhaps, publish it as a pamphlet. 

With respect to my big interleaved abstract,* would you 
send it any time before you leave England, to the enclosed 
address? If you do not go till August yth-ioth, I should 
prefer it left with you. I hope you have jotted criticisms on 
my MS. on big Genera, &c., sufficient to make you remember 
your remarks, as I should be infinitely sorry to lose them. 
And I see no chance of our meeting if you go soon abroad. 
We thank you heartily for your invitation to join you : I can 
fancy nothing which I should enjoy more ; but our children 
are too delicate for us to leave; I should be mere living 
lumber. 

Lastly, you said you would write to Wallace ; I certainly 
should much like this, as it would quite exonerate me : if you 
would send me your note, sealed up, I would fonvard it with 
my own, as I know the address, &c. 

Will you answer me some time about your notions of the 
length of my abstract. 

If you see Lyell, will you tell him how truly grateful I feel 
for his kind interest in this affair of mine. You must know that 
I look at it, as very important, for the reception of the view 
of species not being immutable, the fact of the greatest 
Geologist and Botanist in England taking any sort of interest 
in the subject: I am sure it will do much to break down 
prejudices. 

Yours affectionately, 

C. Darwin.

Miss Wedgwood’s, Hartfield, Tunbridge Wells, 

[July 13th, 1858]. 

My dear Hooker, — ^Your letter to Wallace seems to me 
perfect, quite clear and most courteous. I do not think it 
could possibly be improved, and I have to-day forwarded it 
with a letter of my own. I always thought it very possible 
that I might be forestalled, but I fancied that I had a grand 
enough soul not to care ; but I found myself mistaken and 
punished ; I had, however, quite resigned myself, and had 
written half a letter to Wallace to give up all priority to him, 
and should certainly not have changed had it not been for 
Lyell’s and your quite extraordinary kindness. I assure you 
I feel it, and shall not forget it I am more than satisfied at 
what took place at the Linnean Society. 1 had thought 
that your letter and mine to Asa Gray were to be only an 
appendix to Wallace’s paper. 

We go from here in a few days to the sea-side, probably 
to the Isle of Wight, and on my return (after a battle with 
pigeon skeletons) I will set to work at the abstract, though 
how on earth I shall make anything of an abstract in thirty 
pages of the Journal, I know not, but will try my best. I shall 
order Bentham ; is it not a pity that you should waste time 
in tabulating varieties ? for I can get the Down schoolmaster 
to do it on my return, and can tell you all the results. 

I must try and see you before your journey ; but do not 
think I am fishing to ask you to come to Down, for you will 
have no time for that. 

You cannot imagine how pleased I am that the notion of 
Natural Selection has acted as a purgative on your bowels of 
immutability. Whenever naturalists can look at species 
changing as certain, what a magnificent field will be open, — 
on all the laws of variation, — on the genealogy of all living 
beings, — on their lines of migration, &c. &c. Pray thank

Mrs. Hooker for her very kind little note, and pray say how 
truly obliged I am, and in truth ashamed to think that she 
should have had the trouble of copying my ugly MS. It was 
extraordinarily kind in her. Farewell, my dear kind friend.

C. Darwin. 

P.S. — I have had some fun here in watching a slave-making 
ant; for I could not help rather doubting the wonderful 
stories, but I have now seen a defeated marauding party, 
and I have seen a migration from one nest to another of the 
slave-makers, carrying their slaves (who are house, and not 
field niggers) in their mouths 1 

I am inclined to think that it is a true generalisation that, 
when honey is secreted at one point of the circle of the corolla, 
if the pistil bends, it always bends into the line of the gangway 
to the honey. The Larkspur is a good instance, in contrast 
to Columbine, — if you think of it, just attend to this little 
point.

not otherwise. 

I have never half thanked you for all the extraordinary 
trouble and kindness you showed me about Wallace’s affair. 
Hooker told me what was done at the Linnean Society, and I 
am far more than satisfied, and I do not think that Wallace can 
think my conduct unfair in allowing you and Hooker to do 
whatever you thought fair. 1 certainly was a little annoyed 
to lose all priority, but had resigned myself to my fate. I am

to do justice to the subject, except by giving the facts on 
which each conclusion is grounded, and that will, of course, 
be absolutely impossible. Your name and- Hooker’s name 
appearing as in any way the least interested in my work 
will, I am certain, have the most important bearing in leading 
people to consider the subject without prejudice. I look at 
this as so very important, that I am almost glad of Wallace’s

I am disgusted with my bad writing. I could not improve 
it, without rewriting all, which would not be fair or worth 
while, as I have begun on a better abstract for the Linnean 
Society. My excuse is that it never was intended for publica- 
tion. I have made only a few corrections in the style ; but I 
cannot make it decent, but I hope moderately intelligible. I 
suppose some one will correct the revise. (Shall I ?) 

Could I have a clean proof to send to Wallace ? 

I have not yet fully considered your remarks on big genera 
(but your general concurrence is of the highest possible interest 
to me) ; nor shall I be able till I re-read my MS. ; but you 
may rely on it that you never make a remark to me which is

lost from inattention. I am particularly glad you do not 
object to my stating your objections in a modified form, for 
they always struck me as very important, and as having 
much inherent value, whether or no they were fatal to my 
notions. I will consider and reconsider all your remarks. . . . 

I have ordered Bentham, for, as says, it will be very 

curious to see a Flora written by a man who knows nothing 
of British plants ! ! 

I am very glad at what you say about my Abstract, but 
you may rely on it that I will condense to the utmost. I 
would aid in money if it is too long.* In how many ways 
you have aided me !

[The ‘ Abstract ’ mentioned in the last sentence of the pre- 
ceding letter was in fact the ‘ Origin of Species,’ on which he 
now set to work. In his ‘Autobiography’ (p. 85) he speaks 
of beginning to write in September, but in his Diary he 
wrote, “July 20 to Aug. 12, at Sandown, began Abstract of 
Species book.” “Sep. 16, Recommenced Abstract” The 
book was begun with the idea that it would be published as

must take the form of an independent volume.]

This is a very charming place, and we have got a very 
comfortable house. But, alas, I cannot say that the sea has 
done H. or L. much good. Nor has my stomach recovered 
from all our troubles. I am very glad we left home, for si.>c 
children have now died of scarlet fever in Down. We return 
on the 14th of August. 

I have got Bentham,* and am charmed with it, and 
William (who has just started for a tour abroad) has been 
making out all sorts of new (to me) plants capitally. The 
little scraps of information are so capital . . . The English 
names in the analytical keys drive us mad ; give them by 
all means, but why on earth [not] make them subordinate 
to the Latin ; it puts me in a passion. W. charged into the 
Composite and Umbelliferse like a hero, and demolished 
ever so many in grand style. 

I pass my time by doing daily a couple of hours of my 
Abstract, and I find it amusing and improving work. I am 
now most heartily obliged to you and Lyell for having set 
me on this ; for I shall, when it is done, be able to finish my 
work with greater ease and leisure. I confess I hated the 
thought of the job ; and now I find it very unsatisfactory in 
not being able to give my reasons for each conclusion. 

It will be longer than I expected ; it will take thirty-five 
of my MS. folio pages to give an abstract on variation 
under domestication alone ; but I will try to put in nothing 
which does not seem to me of some interest, and which was 
once new to me. It seems a queer plan to give an abstract 
of an unpublished work ; nevertheless, I repeat, I am extremely 
glad I have begun in earnest on it. 

I hope you and Mrs. Hooker will have a very very pleasant 
tour. Farewell, my dear Hooker. 

Yours affectionately,

NorfoUc House, SliankUn, Isle of Wight. 

Thursday [Aug. 5, 1858]. 

My dear Hooker, — I should think the note apologetical 
about the style of the Abstract was best as a note .... But 
I write now to ask you to send me by return of post the MS. 
on big genera, that I may make an abstract of a couple of 
pages in length. I presume that you have quite done with it, 
otherwise I would not for anything have it back. If you tie 
it with string, and mark it MS. for printing, it will not cost, 
I should think, more than 4//. I shall wish much to say that 
you have read this MS. and concur ; but you shall, before I 
read it to the Society, hear the sentence. 

What you tell me after speaking with Busk about the length 
of the Abstract is an immense relief to me ; it will make the 
labour far less, not having to shorten so much every single 
subject ; but I will try not to be too diffusive. I fear it will 
spoil all interest in my book,* whenever published. The 
Abstract, will do very well to divide into several parts : thus I 
have just finished “ Variation under Domestication,” in forty- 
four MS. pages, and that would do for one evening ; but I 
should be extremely sorry if all could not be published 
together. 

What else you say about my Abstract pleases me highly, 
but frightens me, for I fear I shall never be able to make 
it good enough. But how I do run on about my own affairs 

I was astonished to see Sir W. Hooker’s card here two or 
three days ago : I was unfortunately out walking. Henslow, 
also, has written to me, proposing to come to Down on the

clearly. When we meet I must talk over a few points on the 

You speak of going to the sea-side somewhere ; we think 
this the nicest sea-side place which we have ever seen, 
and we like Shanklin better than other spots on the south 
coast of the island, though many are charming and prettier, 
so that I would suggest your thinking of this place. We are 
on the actual coast ; but tastes differ so much about places. 

If you go to Broadstairs, when there is a strong wind from 
the coast of France and in fine, dry, warm weather, look out 
and you will probably (1) see thistle-seeds blown across the 
Channel. The other day I saw one blown right inland, and 
then in a few minutes a second one and then a third ; and I 
said to myself, God bless me, how many thistles there must be 
in France ; and I wrote a letter in imagination to you. But 
I then looked at the low clouds, and noticed that they were 
not coming inland, so I feared a screw was loose, I then walked 
beyond a headland and found the wind parallel to the coast, 
and on this very headland a noble bed of thistles, which by 
every wide eddy were blown far out to sea, and then came 
right in at right angles to the shore 1 One day such a number 
of insects were washed up by the tide, and I brought to life 
thirteen species of Coleoptera ; not that I suppose these came 
from France. But do you watch for thistle-seed as you saunter

CLIMATE AND MIGRATION. 



C. Darwin to Asa Gray. 

Aug. mh [1858]. 

My dear Gray, — Your note of July 27th has just reached 
me in the Isle of Wight. It is a real and great pleasure to me 
to write to you about my notions ; and even if it were not so, 
I should be a most ungrateful dog, after all the invalu- 
able assistance which you have rendered me, if I did not do 
anything which you asked. 

I have discussed in my long MS. the later changes of 
climate and the effect on migration, and I will here give you 
an abstract of an abstract (which latter I am preparing of 
my whole work for the Linnean Society). I cannot give 
you facts, and I must write dogmatically, though I do not 
feel so on any point. I may just mention, in order that you 
may believe that I have some foundation for my views, that 
Hooker has read my MS., and though he at first demurred to 
my main point, he has since told me that further reflection 
and new facts have made him a convert. 

In the older, or perhaps newer, Pliocene age (a little 
before the Glacial epoch) the temperature was higher ; of 
this there can be little doubt ; the land, on a large scale, 
held much its present disposition ; the species were mainly, 
judging from shells, what they are now. At this period 
when all animals and plants ranged 10° or 15° nearer the 
poles, I believe the northern part of Siberia and of North 
America, being almost continuous, were peopled (it is quite 
possible, considering the shallow water, that Behring Straits 
were united, perhaps a little southward) by a nearly uniform 
fauna and flora, just as the Arctic regions now are. The 
climate then became gradually colder till it became what 
it now is ; and then the temperate parts of Europe and 
America would be separated, as far as migration is concerned, 
just as they now are. Then came on the Glacial period, 
driving far south all living things ; middle or even southern

136 THE WRITING OF THE 'ORIGIN OF SPECIES.’ [1858. 

Europe being peopled with Arctic productions ; as the warmth 
returned, the Arctic productions slowly crawled up the moun- 
tains as they became denuded of snow ; and we now see on 
their summits the remnants of a once continuous flora and 
fauna. This is E. Forbes’s theory, which, however, I may 
add, I had written out four years before he published. 

Some facts have made me vaguely suspect that between 
the glacial and the present temperature there was a period 
of slightly greater warmth. According to my modification- 
doctrines, I look at many of the species of North America 
which closely represent those of Europe, as having become 
modified since the Pliocene period, when in the northern part 
of the world there was nearly free communication between 
the old and new worlds. But now comes a more important 
consideration ; there is a considerable body of geological 
evidence that during the Glacial epoch the whole world was 
colder ; I inferred that, many years ago, from erratic boulder 
phenomena carefully observed by me on both the east and 
west coast of South America. Now I am so bold as to 
believe that at the height of the Glacial epoch, and when all 
Tropical productions must have been considerably distressed, 
several temperate forms slowly travelled into the heart of the 
Tropics, and even reached the southern hemisphere ; and some 
few southern forms penetrated in a reverse direction north- 
ward. (Heights of Borneo with Australian forms, Abyssinia 
with Cape forms.) Wherever there was nearly continuous high 
land, this migration would have been immensely facilitated ; 
hence the European character of the plants of Tierra del Fuego 
and summits of Cordilleras ; hence ditto on Himalaya. As the 
temperature rose, all the temperate intruders would crawl up 
the mountains. Hence the European forms on Nilgherries, 
Ceylon, summit of Java, Organ Mountains of Brazil. But 
these intruders being surrounded with new forms would be 
very liable to be improved or modified by natural selection, 
to adapt them to the new forms with which they had to

compete ; hence most of the forms on the mountains of the 
Tropics are not identical, but representative forms of North 
temperate plants. 

There are similar classes of facts in marine productions. 
All this will appear very rash to you, and rash it may be ; 
but I am sure not so rash as it will at first appear to you : 
Hooker could not stomach it at all at first, but has become 
largely a convert. From mammalia and shallow sea, I believe 
Japan to have been joined to main land of China within no 
remote period ; and then the migration north and south 
before, during, and after the Glacial epoch would act on 
Japan, as on the corresponding latitude of China and the 
United States. 

I should beyond anything like to know whether you have 
any Alpine collections from Japan, and what is their character. 
This letter is miserably expressed, but perhaps it will suffice 
to show what I believe have been the later main migrations 
and changes of temperature. . . .

grows to an inordinate length ; yet fully to make my view 
clear (and never giving briefly more than a fact or two, and 
slurring over difficulties), I cannot make it shorter. It will 
yet take me three or four months ; so slow do I work, though 
never idle. You cannot ■ imagine what a service you have

thought I had got all clear, it has clarified my brains very 
much, by making me weigh the relative importance of the 
several elements.

it to be) capital memoir of R. Brown in the Gardener^

I pray you not to pronounce too strongly against Natural

you will strike out many difficulties, which have never occurred

I am sorry to have bothered you, though I have been much

the moment that you are the one living soui from whom I have 
constantiy received sympathy. Beiieve [me] that I never forget 
for even a minute how much assistance I have received from 
you. You are quite correct that I never even suspected that 
my specuiations were a "jam-pot" to you ; indeed, I thought, 
untii quite iateiy, that my MS. had produced no effect on 
you, and this has often staggered me. Nor did I know that 
you had spoken in generai terms about my work to our 
friends, excepting to dear oid Faiconer, who some few years 
ago once told me that I should do more mischief than any ten 
other naturalists would do good, [and] that I had half-spoiled 
you already ! All this is stupid egotistical stuff, and I write 
it only because you may think me ungrateful for not having 
valued and understood your sympathy ; which God knows is 
not the case. It is an accursed evil to a man to become so 
absorbed in any subject as I am in mine. 

I was in London yesterday for a few hours with Falconer, 
and he gave me a magnificent lecture on the age of man. We 
arc not upstarts ; we can boast of a pedigree going far back 
in time coeval with extinct species. He has a grand fact of 
some large molar tooth in the Trias.

and Affinities, being less worked up, I dare say each of these 
will take me three weeks, so that I shall not have done at 
soonest till April, and then my Abstract will in bulk make 
a small volume. I never give more than one or two instances, 
and I pass over briefly all difficulties, and yet I cannot make 
my Abstract shorter, to be satisfactory, than I am now doing, 
and yet it will expand to a small volume. . . . 

[About this time my father revived his old knowledge of 
beetles in helping his boys in their collecting. He sent a 
short notice to the ‘ Entomologist’s Weekly Intelligencer,’ June 
25th, 1859, recording the capture of Licinus silphoides, Clytus 
mystiais, Panagceus ^-pustulatus. The notice begins with 
the words, “We three very young collectors having lately 
taken in the parish of Down,” 8:c., and is signed by three 
of his boys, but was clearly not written by them. I have 
a vivid recollection of the pleasure of turning out my bottle 
of dead beetles for my father to name, and the excitement, 
in which he fully shared, when any of them proved to 
be uncommon ones. The following letters to Mr. Fox 
(November 13, 1858), and to Sir John Lubbock, illustrate 
this point :]

when I used to come and drink coffee with you daily! I 
am reminded of old days by my third boy having just begun 
collecting beetles, and he caught the other day Brac/iinus

Thursday [before 1857]. 

Dear Lubbock, — I do not know whether you care about 
beetles, but for the chance I send this in a bottle, which I 
never remember having seen ; though it is excessively rash 
to speak from a twenty-five-year old remembrance. When- 
ever we meet you can tell me whether you know it. . . . 

I feel like an old war-horse at the sound of the trumpet, 
when I read about the capturing of rare beetles — is not this a 
magnanimous simile for a decayed entomologist ? — It really 
almost makes me long to begin collecting again. Adios.

your very kind present of your Essays.* I have already read 
several of them with much interest. Your remarks on the 
general argument of the so-called development theory seems 
to me admirable. I am at present preparing an Abstract of a 
larger work on the changes of species ; but I treat the subject 
simply as a naturalist, and not from a general point of view, 
otherwise, in my opinion, your argument could not have been 
improved on, and might have been quoted by me with great 
advantage. Your article on Music has also interested me 
much, for I had often thought on the subject, and had come

to nearly the same conclusion with you, though unable to 
support the notion in any detail. Furthermore, by a curious 
coincidence, expression has been for years a persistent subject 
with me for loose speculation, and I must entirely agree with 
you that all expression has some biological meaning. I hope 
to profit by your criticism on style, and with very best thanks, 
I beg leave to remain, dear Sir, 

Yours truly obliged,

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, Dec. 24th [1858]. 

My dear Hooker, — Your news about your unsolicited 
salary and house is jolly, and creditable to the Government. 
My room (28 x 19), with divided room above, with all 
fixtures (and painted), not furniture, and plastered outside, 
cost about ;£'500. I am heartily glad of this news. 

Your facts about distribution arc, indeed, very striking. 
I remember well that none of your many wonderful facts 
in your several works, perplexed me, for years, more than 
the migration having been mainly from north to south, and not 
in the reverse direction. I have now at last satisfied myself 
(but that is very different from satisfying others) on this 
head ; but it would take a little volume to fully explain 
myself. I did not for long see the bearing of a conclusion, 
at which I had arrived, with respect to this subject It is, 
that species inhabiting a very large area, and therefore exist- 
ing in large numbers, and which have been subjected to the 
severest competition with many other forms, will have 
arrived, through natural selection, at a higher stage of per- 
fection than the inhabitants of a small area. Thus I ex- 
plain the fact of so many anomalies, or what may be called 
“ living fossils,” inhabiting now only fresh water, having been 
beaten out, and exterminated in the sea, by more im-

proved forms ; thus all existing Ganoid fishes are fresh water, 
as [are] Lepidosiren and Omithorhynchus, &c. The plants of 
Europe with Asia, as being the largest territory, I look at as 
the most “ improved,” and therefore as being able to with- 
stand the less-perfected Australian plants ; though these could 
not resist the Indian. See how all the productions of New 
Zealand yield to those of Europe. I dare say you will think 
all this utter bosh, but I believe it to be solid truth. 

You will, I think, admit that Australian plants, flourishing 
so in India, is no argument that they could hold their own 
against the ten thousand natural contingencies of other plants, 
insects, animals, &c. &c. With respect to South-West Australia 
and the Cape, I am shut up, and can only d — n the whole 
case. 

. . . You say you should like to see my MS., but you did 
read and approved of my long Glacial chapter, and I have 
not yet written my Abstract on the whole of the Geographical 
Distribution, nor shall I begin it for two or three weeks. 
But either Abstract or the old MS. I should be delighted to 
send you, especially the Abstract chapter. . . . 

I have now written 330 folio pages of my Abstract, and it 
will require 150-200; so that it will make a printed volume 
of 400 pages, and must be printed separately, which I think 
will be better in many respects. The subject really seems to 
me too large for discussion at any Society, and I believe 
religion would be brought in by men whom I know. 

I am thinking of a l2mo. volume, like Lyell’s fourth or fifth 
edition of the ‘ Principles.’ ... 

I have written you a scandalously long note. So now 
good bye, my dear Hooker, 

Ever yours, 

C. Darwin.

144 the writing of the ‘origin of species.’ [1859. 

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, Jan. 20th, 1859. 

My dear Hooker, — I should very much like to borrow 
Heer at some future time, for I want to read nothing per- 
plexing at present till my Abstract is done. Your last very 
instructive letter shall make me very cautious on the hyper- 
speculative points we have been discussing. 

When you say you cannot master the train of thoughts, 
I know well enough that they are too doubtful and obscure to 
be mastered. I have often experienced what you call the 
humiliating feeling of getting more and more involved in 
doubt, the more one thinks of the facts and reasoning on 
doubtful points. But I always comfort myself with thinking 
of the future, and in the full belief that the problems which we 
are just entering on, will some day be solved ; and if we just 
break the ground we shall have done some service, even if we 
reap no harvest 

I quite agree that we only differ in degree about the means 
of dispersal, and that I think a satisfactory amount of accord- 
ance. You put in a very striking manner the mutation of our 
continents, and I quite agree ; I doubt only about our oceans. 

I also agree (I am in a very agreeing frame of mind) with 
your argumentum ad hominem, about the highness of the 
Australian Flora from the number of species and genera ; but 
here comes in a superlative bothering element of doubt, viz. 
the effects of isolation. 

The only point in which I presumptuously rather demur 
is about the status of the naturalised plants in Australia. 1 
think Muller speaks of their having spread largely beyond 
cultivated ground ; and I can hardly believe that our Euro- 
pean plants would occupy stations so barren that the native 
plants could not live there. I should require much evidence 
to make me believe this. I have written this note merely to 
thank you, as you will see it requires no answer.

very sure what he would say. He must be an amiable man. 
Please return that to me, and Lyell ought to be told how 
well satisfied he is. These letters have vividly brought before 
me how much I owe to your and Lyell’s most kind and 
generous conduct in all this affair.

and I can rest ! . . . 

C. Danvin to A. R, Wallace.

My dear Sir, — I was extremely much pleased at receiving 
three days ago your letter to me and that to Dr. Hooker. 
Permit me to say how heartily I admire the spirit in which 
they are written. Though I had absolutely nothing whatever 
to do in leading Lyell and Hooker to what they thought a 
fair course of action, yet I naturally could not but feel anxious 
to hear what your impression would be. I owe indirectly 
much to you and them ; for I almost think that Lyell would 
have proved right, and I should never have completed my 
larger work, for I have found my Abstract hard enough with 
ray poor health, but now, thank God, I am in my last chapter 
but one. My Abstract will make a small volume of 400 or 
500 pages. Whenever published, I will, of course, send you a 
copy, and then you will see what I mean about the part 
which I believe selection has played with domestic produc-

tions. It is a very different part, as you suppose, from that 
played by “ Natural Selection.” I sent off by the same address 
as this note, a copy of the ‘Journal of the Linnean Society,’ 
and subsequently I have sent some half-dozen copies of the 
paper. I have many other copies at your disposal. . . . 

I am glad to hear that you have been attending to birds’ 
nests. I have done so, though almost exclusively under one 
point of view, viz. to show that instincts vary, so that selec- 
tion could work on and improve them. Few other instincts, 
so to speak, can be preserved in a Museum. 

Many thanks for your offer to look after horses’ stripes ; if 
there are any donkeys, pray add them. I am delighted 

to hear that you have collected bees’ combs This is 

an especial hobby of mine, and I think I can throw a light 
on the subject If you can collect duplicates, at no very 
great expense, I should be glad of some specimens for myself 
with some bees of each kind. Young, growing, and irregular 
combs, and those which have not had pupae, are most valuable 
for measurements and examination. Their edges should be 
well protected against abrasion. 

Every one whom I have seen has thought your paper very 
well written and interesting. It puts my extracts (written in 
1839, now just twenty years ago !), which I must say in apo- 
logy were never for an instant intended for publication, into 
the shade. 

You cisk about Lyell’s frame of mind. I think he is some- 
what staggered, but does not give in, and speaks with horror, 
often to me, of what a thing it would be, and what a job it 
would be for the next edition of ‘ The Principles,’ if he were 
" perverted.” But he is most candid and honest, and I think 
will end by being perverted. Dr. Hooker has become almost 
as heterodox as you or I, and I look at Hooker as by far the 
most capable judge in Europe. 

Most cordially do I wish you health and entire success in 
all your pursuits, and, God knows, if admirable zeal and 
energy deserve success, most amply do you deserve it I look

at my own career as nearly run out. If I can publish my 
Abstract and perhaps my greater work on the same subject, 
I shall look at my course as done. 

Believe me, my dear sir, yours very sincerely, 

C. Darwin. 



C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, March and [1859]. 

My dear Hooker, — Here is an odd, though very little, 
fact. I think it would be hardly possible to name a bird 
which apparently could have less to do with distribution than 
a Petrel. Sir W. Milner, at St. Kilda, cut open some young 
nestling Petrels, and he found large, curious nuts in their crops ; 
I suspect picked up by parent birds from the Gulf stream. 
He seems to value these nuts excessively. I have asked him 
(but I doubt whether he will) to send a nut to Sir William 
Hooker (I gave this address for grandeur’s sake) to see if any 
of you can name it and its native country. Will you please 
mention this to Sir William Hooker, and if the nut does ar- 
rive, will you oblige me by returning it to “Sir W. 
Milner, Bart., Nunappleton, Tadcaster,” in a registered 
letter, and I will repay you postage. Enclose slip of paper 
with the name and country if you can, and let me hereafter 
know. Forgive me asking you to take this much trouble ; for 
it is a funny little fact after my own heart. 

Now for another subject. I have finished my Abstract of 
the chapter on Geographical Distribution, as bearing on my 
subject. I should like you much to read it ; but I say this, 
believing that you will not do so, if, as I believe to be the 
case, you arc extra busy. On my honour, I shall not be 
mortified, and I earnestly beg you not to do it, if it will 
bother you. I want it, because I here feel especially unsafe, 
and errors may have crept in. Also, I should much like to 
know what parts you will most vehemently object to. I know

we do, and must, differ widely on several heads. Lastly, I 
should like particularly to know whether I have taken any- 
thing from you, which you would like to retain for first publi- 
cation ; but I think I have chiefly taken from your published 
works, and, though I have several times, in this chapter and 
elsewhere, acknowledged your assistance, I am aware that it 
is not possible for me in the Abstract to do it sufficiently.* 
But again let me say that you must not offer to read it if very 
irksome. It is long — about ninety pages, I expect, when 
fully copied out. 

I hope you are all well. Moor Park has done me some good. 

Yours affectionately, 

C. Darwin. 

P.S. — Heaven forgive me, here is another question : How 
far am I right in supposing that with plants, the most import- 
ant characters for main divisions are embryological } The 
seed itself cannot be considered as such, I suppose, nor the 
albumen, &c. But I suppose the cotyledons and their posi- 
tion, and the position of the plumule and the radicle, and the 
position and form of the whole embryo in the seed are 
embryological, and how far are these very important ? I wish 
to instance plants as a case of high importance of embryo- 
logical characters in classification. In the Animal Kingdom 
there is, of course, no doubt of this.

I only want one sentence ; if facts are at all, as 1 suppose,

doubt whether I shall ever get my little volume done, though 
so nearly completed. . . . 

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, March 15th [1859]. 

My dear Hooker, — I am pleased at what you say of my 
chapter. You have not attacked it nearly so much as I 
feared you would. You do not seem to have detected many 
errors. It was nearly all written from memory, and hence I 
was particularly fearful ; it would have been better if the 
whole had first been carefully written out, and abstracted 
afterwards. I look at it as morally certain that it must 
include much error in some of its general views. I will just 
run over a few points in your note, but do not trouble yourself 
to reply without you have something important to say. . . . 

... I should like to know whether the case of endemic 
bats in islands struck you ; it has me especially ; perhaps too 
strongly. 

With hearty thanks, ever yours, 

C. Darwin. 

P.S. — You cannot tell what a relief it has been to me 
your looking over this chapter, as I felt very shaky on it. 

I shall to-morrow finish my last chapter (except a re-

capitulation) on Affinities, Homologies, Embryology, &c., 
and the facts seem to me to come out very strong for 
mutability of species. 

I have been much interested in working out the chapter. 

I shall now, thank God, begin looking over old first chapters 
for press. 

But my health is now so very poor, that even this will take 
me long. 



C. Darwin to W. D. Fox. 

Down, [March] 24th [1859]. 

My dear Fox, — It was very good of you to write to me 
in the midst of all your troubles, though you seem to have 
got over some of them, in the recovery of your wife’s and 
your own health. I had not heard lately of your mother’s 
health, and am sorry to hear so poor an account. But as 
she does not suffer much, that is the great thing ; for mere 
life I do not think is much valued by the old. What a time 
you must have had of it, when you had to go backwards 
and forwards. 

We are all pretty well, and our eldest daughter is improving. 
I can see daylight through my work, and am now finally 
correcting my chapters for the press ; and I hope in a month 
or six weeks to have proof-sheets. I am weary of my work. 
It is a very odd thing that I have no sensation that I over- 
work my brain ; but facts compel me to conclude that my 
brain was never formed for much thinking. We are resolved 
to go for two or three months, when I have finished, to Ilkley, 
or some such place, to see if I can anyhow give my health 
a good start, for it certainly has been wretched of late, and 
has incapacitated me for everything. You do me injustice 
when you think that I work for fame ; I value it to a certain 
extent ; but, if I know myself, I work from a sort of instinct 
to try to make out truth. How glad I should be if you could 
sometime come to Down ; especially when I get a little better.

Down, March 28th [1859]. 

My dear Lyell, — If I keep decently well, I hope to be 
able to go to press with my volume early in May. This being 
so, I want much to beg a little advice from you. From an 
expression in Lady Lyell’s note, I fancy that you have 
spoken to Murray. Is it so ? And is he willing to publish 
my Abstract? If you will tell me whether anything, and 
what has passed, I will then write to him. Does he know at 
all of the subject of the book ? Secondly, can you advise me, 
whether I had better state what terms of publication I should 
prefer, or first ask him to propose terms ? And what do you 
think would be fair terms for an edition ? Share profits, or 
what? 

Lastly, will you be so very kind as to look at the enclosed 
title and give me your opinion and any criticisms ; you must 
remember that, if I have health and it appears worth doing, I 
have a much larger and full book on the same subject nearly 
ready. 

My Abstract will be about five hundred pages of the size of 
your first edition of the ‘ Elements of Geology.’ 

Pray forgive me troubling you with the above queries ; and 
you shall have no more trouble on the subject. I hope the 
world goes well with you, and that you are getting on with 
your various works. 

I am working very hard for me, and long to finish and be 
free and try to recover some health. 

My dear Lyell, ever yours, 

C. Darwin.

152 THE WRITING OF THE ‘ORIGIN OF SPECIES.’ [1859. 

Very sincere thanks to you for standing my proxy for the 
Wollaston Medal. 

P.S. — Would you advise me to tell Murray that my book 
is not more «n-orthodox than the subject makes inevitable. 
That I do not discuss the origin of man. That I do not bring 
in any discussion about Genesis, &c. &c., and only give facts, 
and such conclusions from them as seem to me fair. 

Or had I better say nothing to Murray, and assume that 
he cannot object to this much unorthodoxy, which in fact 
is not more than any Geological Treatise which runs slap 
counter to Genesis. 

Enclosure. 

AN ABSTRACT OF AN ESSAY

SPECIES AND VARIETIES 

THROUGH NATURAL SELECTION 



Charles Darwin, M.A. 



C. Darwin to C. Lyell. 

Down, March 30th [1859]. 

My DEAR Lyell, — ^You have been uncommonly kind in 
all you have done. You not only have saved me much 
trouble and some anxiety, but have done all incomparably 
better than I could have done it I am much pleased at 
all you say about Murray. I will write either to-day or 
to-morrow to him, and will send shortly a large bundle of

MS., but unfortunately I cannot for a week, as the first three 
chapters are in the copyists’ hands. 

I am sorry about Murray objecting to the term Abstract, 
as I look at it as the only possible apology for not giving 
references and facts in full, but I will defer to him and you. 
I am also sorry about the term “ natural selection.” I hope 
to retain it with explanation somewhat as thus : — 

“ Through natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races.” 
Why I like the term is that it is constantly used in all 
works on breeding, and I am surprised that it is not familiar 
to Murray ; but I have so long studied such works that I 
have ceased to be a competent judge. 

I again most truly and cordially thank you for your 
really valuable assistance. 

Yours most truly, 

C. Darwin. 



C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, April and [1859]. 

.... I wrote to him [Mr. Murray] and gave him the 
headings of the chapters, and told him he could not have the 
MS. for ten days or so ; and this morning I received a letter, 
offering me handsome terms, and agreeing to publish with- 
out seeing the MS. ! So he is eager enough ; I think I 
should have been cautious, anyhow, but, owing to your letter, 
I told him most explicitly that I accept his offer solely on con- 
dition that, after he has seen part or all the MS., he has full 
power of retracting. You will think me presumptuous, but 
I think my book will be popular to a certain extent (enough 
to ensure [against] heavy loss) amongst scientific and semi- 
scientific men ; why I think so is, because I have, found in 
conversation so great and surprising an interest amongst such 
men, and some 0-scientific [non-scientific] men on this subject.

and all my chapters are not nearly so dry and dull as that 
which you have read on geographical distribution. Anyhow, 
Murray ought to be the best judge, and if he chooses to publish 
it, I think I may wash my hands of all responsibility. I am 
sure my friends, »>. Lyell and you, have been extraordinarily 
kind in troubling yourselves on the matter. 

I shall be delighted to see you the day before Good 
Friday ; there would be one advantage for you in any other 
day — as I believe both my boys come home on that day — 
and it would be almost impossible that I could send the 
carriage for you. There will, I believe, be some relations in 
the house — ^but I hope you will not care for that, as we shall 
easily get as much talking as my imbecile state allows. I 
shall deeply enjoy seeing you. 

.... I am tired, so no more. 

My dear Hooker, your affectionate, 

C. Darwin. 

P.S. — Please to send, well tied up with strong string, my 
Geographical MS., towards the latter half of next week — 
i.e. 7th or 8th — that I may send it with more to Murray; 
and God help him if he tries to read it 

.... I cannot help a little doubting whether Lyell would 
take much pains to induce Murray to publish my book ; this 
was not done at my request, and it rather grates against my 
pride. 

I know that Lyell has been infinitely kind about my affair, 
but your dashed [i.e. underlined] “induce” gives the idea that 
Lyell had unfairly urged Murray. 

C. Darwin to Asa Gray. 

April 4th [1859].

you that it will be the highest satisfaction to me to do so : I 
look at the request as a high compliment I shall not, you

may depend, forget a request which I look at as a favour. But 
(and it is a heavy “ but ” to me) it will be long before I go to 
press ; I can truly say I am //ever idle ; indeed, I work too 
hard for my much weakened health ; yet I can do only three 
hours of work daily, and I cannot at all see when I shall have 
finished : I have done eleven long chapters, but I have got 
some other very difficult ones : as paleontology, classifica- 
tions, and embryology, &c., and I have to correct and add 
largely to all those done. I find, alas ! each chapter takes me 
on an average three months, so slow I am. There is no end 
to the necessary digressions. I have just finished a chapter 
on instinct, and here I found grappling with such a subject as 
bees’ cells, and comparing all my notes made during twenty 
years, took up a despairing length of time. 

But I am running on about myself in a most egotistical 
style Yet I must just say how useful I have again and again 
found your letters, which I have lately been looking over and 
quoting ! but you need not fear that I shall quote anything 
you would dislike, for I try to be very cautious on this 
head. I most heartily hope you may succeed in getting your 
" incubus ” of old work off your hands, and be in some degree 
a free maa .... 

Again let me say that I do indeed feel grateful to you . . . 



C. Da/rwin to J. Murray. 

Do«-n, April Jtb [1859]. 

My dear Sir, — I send by this post, the Title (with some 
remarks on a separate page), and the first three chapters. 
If you have patience to read all Chapter I., I honestly think 
you will have a fair notion of the interest of the whole book. 
It may be conceit, but I believe the subject will interest 
the public, and I am sure that the views arc original If you 
think otherwise, I must repeat my request that you will freely

reject my work ; and though I shall be a little disappointed, 
I shall be in no way injured. 

If you choose to read Chapters II. and III., you will have 
a dull and rather abstruse chapter, and a plain and interesting 
one, in my opinion. 

As soon as you have done with the MS., please to send it 
by cartful messenger, and plainly directed, to Miss G. Tollett, 
14, Queen Anne Street, Cavendish Square. 

This lady, being an excellent judge of style, is going to 
look out for errors for me. 

You must take your own time, but the sooner you finish, 
the sooner she will, and the sooner I shall get to press, which 
I so earnestly wish. 

I presume you will wish to see Chapter IV., the key-stone 
of my arch, and Chapters X. and XL, but please to inform 
me on this head. 

My dear Sir, yours sincerely, 

C. Darwin. 

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, April nth [1859]. 

... I write one line to say that I heard from Murray 
•yesterday, and he says he has read the first three chapters of 
one MS. (and this includes a very dull one, and he abides by 
his offer). Hence he does not want more MS., and you can 
send my Geographical chapter when it pleases you. . . . 

[Part of the MS. seems to have been lost on its way back 
to my father, he wrote (April 14) to Sir J. D. Hooker : 

“ I have the old MS., otherwise, the loss would have killed 
me ! The worst is now that it will cause delay in getting to 
press, and far worst of all, I lose all advantage of your having 
looked over my chapter, except the third part returned. I 
am very sorry Mrs. Hooker took the trouble of copying the 
two pages.”] ,

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

[April or May, 1859.] 

. . . Please do not say to any one that I thought my 
book on Species would be fairly popular, and have a fairly 
remunerative sale (which was the height of my ambition), 
for if it prove a dead failure, it would make me the more 
ridiculous. 

I enclose a criticism, a taste of the future — 

Rev. S. Haughtoris Address to the Geological Society, Dublin.* 

“This speculation of Messrs. Darwin and Wallace would 
not be worthy of notice were it not for the weight of authority 
of the names (i.e. Lyell’s and yours), under whose auspices it 
has been brought forward. If it means what it says, it is a 
truism ; if it means anything more, it is contrary to fact” 

Q. E. D. 

C. Darwin to f. D. Hooker. 

Down, May nth [1859]. 

My dear Hooker, — Thank you for telling me about 
obscurity of style. But on my life no nigger with lash over 
him could have worked harder at clearness than I have done. 
But the very difficulty to me, of itself leads to the probability 
that I fail. Yet one lady who has read all my MS. has 
found only two or three obscure sentences, but Mrs. Hooker 
having so found it, makes me tremble. I will do my best in 
proofs. You are a good man to take the trouble to write

thought we could not make our ideas clear to each other by 
talk, or if either of us had time to write in extenso. 

I imagine from some expressions (but if you ask me what, 
I could not answer) that you look at variability as some 
necessary contingency with organisms, and further that there 
is some necessary tendency in the variability to go on 
diverging in character or degree. If you do, I do not agree. 
" Reversion ” again (a form of inheritance), I look at as in 
no way directly connected with Variation, though of course 
inheritance is of fundamental importance to us, for if a 
variation be not inherited, it- is of no signification to us. It 
was on such points as these I fancied that we perhaps started 
differently. 

I fear that my book will not deserve at all the pleasant 
things you say about it ; and Good Lord, how I do long to 
have done with it ! 

Since the above was written, I have received and have 
been much interested by A. Gray. I am delighted at his 
note about my and Wallace’s paper. He will go round, for 
it is futile to give up very many species, and stop at an 
arbitrary line at others. It is what my grandfather called 
Unitarianism, “a feather bed to catch a falling Christian.” . . . 

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Do«t), May i8th [1859]. 

My sear Hooker, — My health has quite failed. I am 
off to-morrow for a week of Hydropathy. I am very very 
sorry to say that I cannot look over any proofs * in the week, 
as my object is to drive the subject out of my head. I shall 
return to-morrow week. If it be worth while, which probably 
it is not, you could keep back any proofs till my return home. 

In haste, ever yours, 

C. Darwin.

C. Darwin to J. Murray. 

Down, June 14th [1859]. 

My dear Sir, — The diagram will do very well, and I 
will send- it shortly to Mr. West to have a few trifling 
corrections made. 

I get on very slowly with proofs. I remember writing to 
you that I thought there would be not much correction. I 
honestly wrote what I thought, but was most grievously 
mistaken. I find the style incredibly bad, and most difficult 
to make clear and smooth. I am extremely sorry to say, on 
account of expense, and loss of time for me, that the cor- 
rections are very heavy, as heavy as possible. But from 
casual glances, I still hope that later chapters are not so 
badly written. How I could have svritten so badly is quite 
inconceivable, but I suppose it was owing to my whole 
attention being fixed on the general line of argument, and 
not on details. All 1 can say is, that I am very sorry. 

Yours very sincerely, 

■ C. Darwin. 

P.S. — I have been looking at the corrections, and consider- 
ing them. It seems to me that I shall put you to a quite unfair 
expense If you please I should like to enter into some 
such arrangement as the following : When work completed, 
you to allow in the account a fairly moderately heavy charge 
for corrections, and all excess over that to be deducted from 
my profits, or paid by me individually.

C. Darwin to C. Lydl. 

Down, June 21st [1859]. 

... I am working very hard, but get on slowly, for I find 
that my corrections are terrifically heavy, and the work most 
difficult to me. I have corrected 130 pages, and the volume 
will be about 500. I have tried my best to make it clear and 
striking, but very much fear that I have failed — so many dis- 
cussions are and must be very perplexing. I have done my 
best. If you had all my materials, I am sure you would have 
made a splendid book. I long to finish, for I am nearly 
worn out. 

My dear Lyell, ever yours most truly, 

C. Darwin. 



C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, 22nd [June, 1859]. 

My dear Hooker, — I did not answer your pleasant note, 
with a good deal of news to me, of May 30th, as I have 
been expecting proofs from you. But now, having nothing 
particular to do, I will fly a note, though I have nothing 
particular to say or ask. Indeed, how can a man have any- 
thing to say, who spends every day in correcting accursed 
proofs ; and such proofs ! I have fairly to blacken them, and 
fasten slips of paper on, so miserable have I found the style. 
You say that you dreamt that my book was entertaining; that 
dream is pretty well over with me, and I begin to fear that 
the public will find it intolerably dry and perplexing. But I 
will never give up that a better man could have made a 
splendid book out of the materials. I was glad to hear about 
Prestwich’s paper.* My doubt has been (and I see Wright

of flint are really tools ; their numbers make me doubt, and 
when I formerly looked at Boucher de Perthe’s drawings, I 
came to the conclusion that they were angular fragments 
broken by ice action. 

Did crossing the Acacia do any good ? I am so hard 
worked, that I can make no experiments. I have got only 
to 1 50 pages in first proof. 

Adios, my dear Hooker, ever yours, 

C. Darwin. 



C. Darwin to J. Murray. 

Down, July 25th [1859]. 

My dear Sir, — I write to say that five sheets are returned 
to the printers ready to strike off; and two more sheets require 
only a revise ; so that I presume you will soon have to decide 
what number of copies to print off. 

I am quite incapable of forming any opinion. I think I 
have got the style fairly good and clear, with infinite trouble. 
But whether the book will be successful to a degree to satisfy 
you, I really cannot conjecture. I heartily hope it may. 

My dear Sir, yours very sincerely, 

C. Darwin.

My dear Mr. Wallace, — I received your letter and

you for allowing me to read it. Had I read it some months- 
ago, I should have profited by it for my forthcoming volume. 
But my two chapters on this subject are in type, and, though 
not yet corrected, I am so wearied out and weak in health, 
that I am fully resolved not to add one word, and merely 
improve the style. So you will see that my views are nearly 
the same with yours, and you may rely on it that not one 
word shall be altered owing to my having read your ideas. 
Are you aware that Mr. W. Earl * [«c] published several years 
ago the view of distribution of animals in the Malay Archi- 
pelago, in relation to the depth of the sea between the islands > 
I was much struck with this, and have been in the habit of 
noting all facts in distribution in that archipelago, and else- 
where, in this relation. I have been led to conclude that 
there has been a good deal of naturalisation in the different 
Malay islands, and which I have thought, to a certain extent, 
would account for anomalies. Timor has been my greatest 
puzzle. What do you say to the peculiar Felis there? I 
wish that you had visited Timor ; it has been asserted that a 
fossil mastodon’s or elephant’s tooth (I forget which) has been 
found there, which would be a grand fact I was aware that 
Celebes was very peculiar ; but the relation to Africa is quite 
new to mo, and marvellous, and almost passes belief. It is as- 
anomaious as the relation of filan/s in S.W. Australia to the. 
Cape of Good Hope. I differ wholly from you on the colonisa- 
tion of oceanic islands, but you will have every one else 
on your side. I quite agree with respect to all islands not 
situated far in the ocean. I quite agree on the little occa- 
sional intermigration between lands [islands?] when once 
pretty well stocked with inhabitants, but think this does not 
apply to rising and ill-stocked islands. Are you aware that 
annually birds are blown to Madeira, the Azores (and to 
Bermuda from America) ? I wish I had given a fuller abstract 
of my reasons for not believing in Forbes’s great continental

... I am not surprised at your finding your Introduction 
very difficult. But do not grudge the labour, and do not say 
you “ have burnt your fingers,” and are “ deep in the mud ” ; 
for I feel sure that the result will be well worth the labour. 
Unless I am a fool, I must be a judge to some extent of the 
value of such general essays, and I am fully convinced that 
yours are the most valuable ever published. 

I have corrected all but the last two chapters of my book, 
and hope to have done revises and all in about three weeks, 
and then I (or we all) shall start for some months’ hydropathy ; 
ray health has been very bad, and I am becoming as weak as a 
child, and incapable of doing anything whatever, except my 
three hours daily work at proof-sheets. God knows whether 
I shall ever be good for anything again, perhaps a long rest 
and hydropathy may do something. 

I have not had A. Gray’s Essay, and should not feel up to 
criticise it, even if I had the impertinence and courage. You 
will believe me that I speak strictly the truth when I say 
that your Australian Essay is extremely interesting to me, 
rather too much so. I enjoy reading it over, and if you think 
my criticisms are worth anything to you, I beg you to send 
the sheets (if you can give me time for good days) ; but

wish it for your own sake. 

I had a terribly long fit of sickness yesterday, which makes 
the world rather extra gloomy to-day, and I have an insanely 
strong wish to finish my accursed book, such corrections every 
page has required as I never saw before. It is so weariful,

... I am very glad you wish to see my clean sheets : I should 
have offered them, but did not know whether it would bore 
you ; I wrote by this morning’s post to Murray to send them. 
Unfortunately I have not got to the part which will interest 
you, I think most, and which tells most in favour of the view, 
viz. Geological Succession, Geographical Distribution, and espe- 
cially Morphology, Embryology and Rudimentary Oi^ans. I 
will see that the remaining sheets, when printed off, are sent to 
you. But would you like for me to send the last and perfect 
revises of the sheets as I correct them ? if so, send me your 
address in a blank envelope. I hope that you will read all, 
whether dull (especially latter part of Chapter II.) or not, for 
I am convinced there is not a sentence which has not a 
bearing on the whole argument. You will find Chapter IV. 
perplexing and unintelligible, without the aid of the enclosed 
queer diagram,* of which I send an old and useless proof. I 
have, as Murray says, corrected so heavily, as almost to have 
re-written it ; but yet I fear it is poorly written. Parts are

intricate ; and I do not think that even you could make them 
quite clear. Do not, I beg, be in a hurry in committing 
yourself (like so many naturalists) to go a certain length and 
no further ; for I am deeply convinced that it is absolutely 
necessary to go the whole vast length, or stick to the creation 
of each separate species ; I argue this point briefly in the last 
chapter. Remember that your verdict will probably have 
more influence than my book in deciding whether such 
views as I hold will be admitted or rejected at present ; in 
the future I cannot doubt about their admittance, and our 
posterity will marvel as much about the current belief as we 
do about fossil shells having been thought to have been 
created as we now see them. But forgive me for running 
on about my hobby-horse. . . . 

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, [Sept] nth [1859]. 

My dear Hooker, — I corrected the last proof yesterday, 
and I have now my revises, index, &c, which will take me 
near to the end of the month. So that the neck of my 
work, thank God, is broken. 

I write now to say that I am uneasy in my conscience 
about hesitating to look over your proofs, but I was feeling 
miserably unwell and shattered when I wrote. I do not 
suppose I could be of hardly any use, but if I could, pray 
send me any proofs. I should be (and fear I was) the most 
ungrateful man to hesitate to do anything for you after some 
fifteen or more years’ help from you. 

As soon as ever I have fairly finished I shall be off to Ilkley, 
or some other Hydropathic establishment. But I shall be some 
time yet, as my proofs have been so utterly obscured with 
corrections, that I have to correct heavily on revises. 

Murray proposes to publish the first week in November. 
Oh, good heavens, the relief to my head and body to banish 
the whole subject from my mind !

you have again given me similar pleasure by the manner

satisfactory to me, and I thank .you for myself, and even 
more for the subject’s sake, as I know well that the sentence 
will make many fairly consider the subject, instead of ridiculing 
it. Although your previously felt doubts on the immutability 
of species, may have more influence in converting you (if you 
be converted) than my book ; yet as I regard your verdict 
as far more important in my own eyes, and I believe in the 
eyes of the world than of any other dozen men, I am 
naturally very anxious about it. Therefore let me beg you 
to keep your mind open till you receive (in perhaps a 
fortnight’s time) my latter chapters, which are the most 



* Sir Charles was President of 
the Geological section at the meet- 
ing of the British Association at 
Aberdeen in 1859. The follorving 
passage occurs in the address : 
" On this difficult and mysterious 
subject a work will very shortly 
appear by Mr. Charles Darwin, the 
result of twenty years of observa- 
tions and experiments in Zoology, 
Botany, and Geology, by which he 
has been led to the conclusion that 
those powers of nature which give 
rise to races and permanent varieties 



in animals and plants, are the same 
as those which in much longer 
periods produce species, and in a 
still longer series of ages give rise 
to differences of generic rank. He 
appears to me to have succeeded 
by his investigations and reasonings 
in throwing a flood of light on 
many classes of phenomena con- 
nected with the affinities, geographi- 
cal distribution, and geological suc-

important of all on the favourable side. The last chapter, 
which sums up, and balances in a mass, all the arguments 
contra and pro, will, I think, be useful to you. I cannot too 
strongly express my conviction of the general truth of my 
■doctrines, and God knows I have never shirked a difficulty. 
I am foolishly anxious for your verdict, not that I shall be 
disappointed if you are not converted ; for I remember the 
long years it took me to come round ; but I shall be most 
deeply delighted if you do come round, especially if I have a 
fair share in the conversion, 1 shall then feel that my career 
is run, and care little whether I ever am good for anything 
again in this life. 

Thank you much for allowing me to put in the sentence 
about your grave doubt.* So much and too much about 
myself. 

I have read with extreme interest in the Aberdeen paper 
about the flint tools ; you have made the whole case far 
clearer to me ; I suppose that you did not think the evidence 
sufficient about the Glacial period. 

With cordial thanks for your splendid notice of my book. 

Believe me, my dear Lyell, your affectionate disciple, 
Charles Darwin. 

C. Darwin to W. D. Fox. 

Down, Sept. 23rd [1859]. 

My dear Fox, — I was very glad to get your letter a few 
days ago. I was wishing to hear about you, but have been 
in such an absorbed, slavish, overworked state, that I had not 
heart without compulsion to write to any one or do anything 
beyond my daily work. Though your account of yourself is 
better, I cannot think it at all satisfactory, and I wish you 
would soon go to Malvern again. My father used to believe 
largely in an old saying that, if a man grew thinner between

fifty and sixty years of age, his chance of long life was poor, and- 
that on the contrary it was k very good sign if he grew fatter 
so that your stoutness, I look at as a very good omen. My 
health has been as bad as it well could be all this summer ; and 
I have kept on my legs, only by going at short intervals to 
Moor Park ; but I have been better lately, and, thank Heaven, 
I have at last as good as done my book, having only the 
index and two or three revises to do. It will be published 
in the first week in November, and a copy shall be sent you. 
Remember it is only an Abstract (but has cost me above 
thirteen months to write ! 1), and facts and authorities are far 
from given in full. I shall be curious to hear what you think 
of it, but I am not so silly as to expect to convert you. 
Lyell has read about half of the volume in clean sheets, and 
gives me very great kudos. He is wavering so much about 
the immutability of species, that I expect he will come round. 
Hooker has come round, and will publish his belief soon. So 
much for my abominable volume, which has cost me so much 
labour that I almost hate it. On October 3rd I start for 
Ilkley, but shall take three days for the journey! It is so 
late that we shall not take a house ; but I go there alone for 
three or four weeks ; then return home for a week and go to 
Moor Park for three or four weeks, and then I shall get a 
moderate spell of hydropathy ; and I intend, if I can keep to 
my resolution, of being idle this winter. But I fear ennui 
will be as bad as a bad stomach. . . . 

C. Darwin to C. Lyell. 

Down, Sept. 25 th [1859]. 

My dear Lyell, — I send by this post four corrected sheets. 
I have altered the sentence about the Eocene fauna being beaten 
by recent, thanks to your remark. But I imagined that it 
would have been clear that I supposed the climate to be 
nearly similar ; you do not doubt, I imagine, that the climate

of the Eocene and recent periods in different parts of the 
world could be matched. Not that I think climate nearly so 
important as most naturalists seem to think. In my opinion 
no error is more mischievous than this. 

I was very glad to find that Hooker, who read over, in 
MS., my Geographical chapters, quite agreed in the view of 
the greater importance of organic relations. I should like 
you to consider p. 77 and reflect on the case of any organism 
in the midst of its range. 

I shall be curious hereafter to hear what you think of dis- 
tribution during the glacial and preceding warmer periods. 
I am so glad you do not think the Chapter on the Imperfec- 
tion of the Geological Record exaggerated ; I was more 
fearful about this chapter than about any part 

Embryology in Chapter VIII. is one of my strongest points 
I think. But I must not bore you by running on. My mind 
is so wearisomely full of the subject 

I do thank you for your eulogy at Aberdeen. I have 
been so wearied and exhausted of late that I have for months 
doubted whether I have not been throwing away time and 
labour for nothing. But now I care not what the universal 
world says ; I have always found you right, and certainly on 
this occasion I am not going to doubt for the first time. 
Whether you go far, or but a very short way with me and others 
who believe as I do, I am contented, for my work cannot be 
in vain. You would laugh if you knew how often I have read 
your paragraph, and it has acted like a little dram. . . . 

Farewell, 

C. Darwin. 

C. Darwin to C. Lyell. 

Down, Sept 30th [1859]. 

My dear Lyell, — I sent off this morning the last sheets, 
but without index, which is not in type. I look at you as my 
Lord High Chancellor in Natural Science, and therefore 



370 THE WRITIXG OF THE ‘ORIGIN OF SPECIES.’ [1859. 



I request you, after you have finished, just to re-run over the 
heads in the recapitulation -part of last chapter. I shall be 
deeply anxious to hear what you decide (if you are able to 
decide) on the balance of the pros and contras given in my 
volume, and of such other pros and contras as may occur 
to you. I hope that you will think that I have given the 
difficulties fairly. I feel an entire conviction that if you 
are now staggered to any moderate extent, you will come 
more and more round, the longer you keep the subject 
at all before your mind. I remember well how many long 
years it was before I could look into the face of some of the 
difficulties and not feel quite abashed. I fairly struck my 
colours before the case of neuter insects. 

I suppose that I am a very slow thinker, for you would be 
surprised at the number of years it took me to see clearly what 
some of the problems were which had to be solved, such as 
the necessity of the principle of divergence of character, the 
extinction of intermediate varieties, on a continuous area, with 
graduated conditions ; the double problem of sterile first 
crosses and sterile hybrids, &c. &c. 

Looking back, I think it was more difficult to see what 
the problems were than to solve them, so far as I have suc- 
ceeded in doing, and this seems to me rather curious. Well, 
good or bad, my work, thank God, is over ; and hard work, I 
can assure you, I have had, and much work which has never 
borne fruit. You can see, by the way I am scribbling, that 
I have an idle and rainy afternoon. I was not able to start 
for Ilkley yesterday as I was too unwell ; but I hope to get 
there on Tuesday or Wednesday. Do, I beg you, when you 
have finished my book and thought a little over it, let me 
hear from you. Never mind and pitch into me, if you think 
it requisite ; some future day, in London possibly, you may 
give me a few criticisms in detail, that is, if you have 
scribbled any remarks on the margin, for the chance of a 
second edition.

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Ilkley, Yorkshire, Oct. 15th [1859]. 

My dear Hooker, — Be a good man and screw out time 
■enough to write me a note and tell me a little about yourself, 
your doings, and belongings. 

Is your Introduction fairly finished ? I know you will abuse 
it, and I know well how much I shall like it I have been 
here nearly a fortnight, and it has done me very much good, 
though I sprained my ankle last Sunday, which has quite 
stopped walking. All my family come here on Monday to 
stop three or four v/eeks, and then I shall go back to the great 
establishment, and stay a fortnight ; so that if I can keep my 
spirits, I shall stay eight weeks here, and thus give hydro- 
pathy a fair chance. Before starting here I was in an awful 
state of stomach, strength, temper, and spirits. My book has 
been completely finished some little time ; as soon as copies 
are ready, of course one will be sent you. I hope you will 
mark your copy with scores, so that I may profit by any 
criticisms. I should like to hear your general impression. 
From Lyell’s letters, he thinks favourably of it, but seems 
staggered by the lengths to which I go. But if you go any 
considerable length in the admission of modification, I can see 
no possible means of drawing the line, and saying here you 
must stop. Lyell is going to reread my book, and I yet enter- 
tain hopes that he will be converted, or perverted, as he calls 
it. Lyell has been extremely kind in writing me three volume- 
like letters ; but he says nothing about dispersal during the

Glacial period. I should like to know what he thinks on this 
head. I have one question to ask : Would it be any good to 
send a copy of my book to Decaisnc ? and do you know any 
philosophical botanists on the Continent, who read English 
and care for such subjects? if so, give me their addresses. 
How about Andersson in Sweden ? You cannot think how 
refreshing it is to idle away the whole day, and hardly ever 
think in the least about my confounded book which half- 
killed me. I much wish I could hear of your taking a real 
rest. I know how very strong you are mentally, but I never 
will believe you can go on working as you have worked of 
late with impunity. You will some day stretch the string 
too tight Farewell, my good, and kind, and dear friend. 
Yours affectionately, 

C. Darwin. 



C. Darwin to T, H. Huxley. 

Ilkley, Yorkshire, Oct. 15th [1859]. 

My DEAR Huxley, — I am here hydropathising and 
coming to life again, after having finished my accursed book, 
which would have been easy work to any one else, but half- 
killed me. I have thought you would give me one bit of 
information, and I know not to whom else to apply ; viz., the 
addresses of Barrande, Von Siebold, Keyserling (I dare say 
Sir Roderick would know the latter). 

Can you tell me of any good and speadative foreigners to 
whom it would be worth while to send copies of my book, on 
the ‘ Origin of Species ’ ? I doubt whether it is worth sending 
to Siebold. I should like to send a few copies about, but 
how many I can afford I know not yet till I hear what price 
Murray affixes. 

I need not say that I will send, of course, one to you, in 
the first week of November. I hope to send copies abroad 
immediately. I shall be intensely curious to hear what effect

the book produces on you. I know that there will be much 
in it which you will object to, and I do not doubt many 
.errors. I am very far from expecting to convert you to 
many of my heresies ; but if, on the whole, you and two or 
three others think I am on the right road, I shall not care 
what the mob of naturalists think. The penultimate chapter,* 
though I believe it includes the truth, will, I much fear, make 
you savage. Do not act and say, like Macleay versus 
Fleming, “ I write with aqua fortis to bite into brass.” 

Ever yours, 

C. Darwin. 



C. Darwin to C. Lyell. 

Ilkley, Yorkshire. 

Oct. 2oth [1859]. 

My dear Lyell, — I have been reading over all your let- 
ters consecutively, and I do not feel that I have thanked you 
half enough for the extreme pleasure which they have given 
me, and for their utility. I see in them evidence of fluctua- 
tion in the degree of credence you give to the theory ; nor am 
I at all surprised at this, for many and many fluctuations I 
have undergone. 

There is one point in your letter which I did not notice, 
about the animals (and many plants) naturalised in Australia, 
which you think could not endure without man’s aid. I can- 
not see how man does aid the feral cattle. But, letting that 
pass, you seem to think, that because they suffer prodigious 
destruction during droughts, they would all be destroyed. In 
the " grandes secos " of La Plata, the indigenous animals, such 
as the American deer, die by thousands, and suffer apparently 
as much as the cattle. In parts of India, after a drought, it 
takes ten or more years before the indigenous mammals get

up to their full number again. Your argument would, I think,, 
apply to the aborigines as well as to the feral. 

An animal or plant which becomes feral in one small ter- 
ritory might be destroyed by climate, but I can hardly 
believe so, when once feral over several large territories. 
Again, I feel inclined to swear at climate : do not think me 
impudent for attacking you about climate. You say you 
doubt whether man could have existed under the Eocene 
climate, but man can now withstand the climate of Esqui- 
maux-land and West Equatorial Africa; and surely you do 
not think the Eocene climate differed from the present 
throughout all Europe, as much as the Arctic regions differ 
from Equatorial Africa ? 

With respect to organisms being created on the American 
type in America, it might, I think, be said that they were 
so created to prevent them being too well created, so as 
to beat the aborigines ; but this seems to me, somehow, a 
monstrous doctrine. 

I have reflected a good deal on what you say on the neces- 
sity of continued intervention of creative power. I cannot see 
this necessity ; and its admission, I think, would make the 
theory of Natural Selection valueless. Grant a simple Arche- 
typal creature, like the Mud-fish or Lepidosiren, with the five 
senses and some vestige of mind, and I believe natural selection 
will account for the production of every vertebrate animal. 

Farewell ; forgive me for indulging in this prose, and 
believe me, with cordial thanks. 

Your ever attached disciple, 

C. Darwin. 

P.S. — When, and if, you reread, I supplicate you to write on 
the margin the word “ expand,” when too condensed, or “ not 
clear,” or “ ? ”. Such marks would cost you little trouble, and 
I could copy them and reflect on them, and their value 
would be infinite to me.

My larger book will have to be wholly re-written, and not 
merely the present volume expanded ; so that I want to waste 
as little time over this volume as possible, if another edition 
be called for ; but I fear the subject will be too perplexing, as- 
I have treated it, for general public. 



C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Ilklcy, Yorkshire. 

Sunday [Oct. 23rd, 1859]. 

My dear Hooker, — I congratulate you on your ‘ Intro- 
duction ’ * being in fact finished. I am sure from what I read 
of it (and deeply I shall be interested in reading it straight 
through), that it must have cost you a prodigious amount of 
labour and thought I shall like very much to see the sheet, 
which you wish me to look at Now I am so completely a 
gentleman, that I have sometimes a little difficulty to pass the 
day ; but it is astonishing how idle a three weeks I have 
passed. If it is any comfort to you, pray delude yourself by 
saying that you intend “ sticking to humdrum science.” But 
I believe it just as much as if a plant were to say that, “ I have 
been growing all my life, and, by Jove, I will stop growing.” 
You cannot help yourself ; you are not clever enough for that. 
You could not even remain idle, as I have done, for three 
weeks I What you say about Lyell pleases me exceedingly ; 
I had not at all inferred from his letters that he had come so 
much round. I remember thinking, above a year ago, that if 
ever I lived to see Lyell, yourself, and Huxley come round,, 
partly by my book, and partly by their own reflections, I 
should feel that the subject is safe, and all the world might 
rail, but that ultimately the theory of Natural Selection 
(though, no doubt, imperfect in its present condition, and 
embracing many errors) would prevail. Nothing will ever 
convince me that three such men, with so much diversified.

knowledge, and so well accustomed to search for truth, could 
err greatly. I have spoken of you here as a convert made 
by me ; but I know well how much larger the share has been 
of your own self-thought. I am intensely curious to hear 
Huxley’s opinion of my book. I fear my long discussion 
on Classification will disgust him ; for it is much opposed 
to what he once said to me. 

But, how I am running on ! You see how idle I am ; but 1 
have so enjoyed your letter that you must forgive me. With 
respect to migration during the Glacial period : I think Lyell 
quite comprehends, for he has given me a supporting fact. 
But, perhaps, he unconsciously hates (do not say so to him) 
the view, as slightly staggering him on his favourite theory of 
all changes of climate being due to changes in the relative 
position of land and water. 

I will send copies of my book to all the men specified by 
you ; . . . would you be so kind as to add title, as Doctor, 
or Professor, or Monsieur, or Von, and initials (when wanted), 
and addresses to the names on the enclosed list, and let 
me have it pretty soon, as towards the close of this week 
Murray says the copies to go abroad will be ready. I am 
anxious to get my view generally known, and not, I hope and 
think, for mere personal conceit

. . . Our difference on “principle of improvement” and 
"power of adaptation” is too profound for discussion by 
letter. If I am wrong, I am quite blind to my error. If 
I am right, our difference will be got over only by your 
re-reading carefully and reflecting on my first four chapters. 
I supplicate you to read these again carefully. The so-called 
improvement of our Shorthorn cattle, pigeons, &c., does not 
presuppose or require any aboriginal “ power of adaptation,” 
or “ principle of improvement ; ” it requires only diversified

variability, and man to select or take advantage of those 
modifications which are useful to him ; so under nature any 
slight modification which chances to arise, and is useful to any 
creature, is selected or preserved in the struggle for life ; any 
modification which is injurious is destroyed or rejected ; any 
which is neither useful nor injurious will be left a fluctuating 
clement When you contrast natural selection and “ improve- 
ment,” you seem always to overlook (for I do not see how 
you can deny) that every step in the natural selection of each 
species implies improvement in that species in relation to its 
conditions of life. No modification can be selected without 
it be an improvement or advantage. Improvement implies, 
I suppose, each form obtaining many parts or organs, all 
excellently adapted for their functions. As each species is 
improved, and as the number of forms will have increased, if 
we look to the whole course of time, the organic condition of 
life for other forms will become more complex, and there will 
be a necessity for other forms to become improved, or they 
will be exterminated ; and I can see no limit to this process 
of improvement, without the intervention of any other and 
direct principle of improvement. All this seems to me quite 
compatible with certain forms fitted for simple conditions, 
remaining unaltered, or being degraded. 

If I have a second edition, I will reiterate “ N.itural Selec- 
tion, and as a general consequence. Natural Improvement”

judging from myself, that you will go much further. How

I quite agree to all you propose about price. But you are 
really too generous about the, to me, scandalously heavy

CHAPTER V. 



BY PROFESSOR HUXLEY. 



ON THE RECEPTION OF THE ‘ORIGIN OF SPECIES.’ 

To the present generation, that is to say, the people a few 
years on the hither and thither side of thirty, the name of 
Charles Darwin stands alongside of those of Isaac Newton and 
Michael Faraday ; and, like them, calls up the grand ideal of 
a searcher after truth and interpreter of Nature. They think 
■of him who bore it as a rare combination of genius, industry, 
and unswerving veracity, who earned his place among the 
most famous men of the age by sheer native power, in the 
teeth of a gale of popular prejudice, and uncheered by a 
sign of favour or appreciation from the official fountains of 
honour ; as one who, in spite of an acute sensitiveness to 
praise and blame, and notwithstanding provocations which 
might have excused any outbreak, kept himself clear of all 
envy, hatred, and malice, nor dealt otherwise than fairly and 
justly with the unfairness and injustice which was showered 
upon him ; while, to the end of his days, he was ready to 
listen with patience and respect to the most insignificant of 
reasonable objectors. 

And with respect to that theory of the origin of the forms of 
life peopling our globe, with which Dan,vin’s name is bound up 
as closely as that of Newton with the theory of gravitation, 
nothing seems to be further from the mind of the present 
generation than any attempt to smother it with ridicule or 
to crush it by vehemence of denunciation. “ The struggle for 
N 2

existence," and " Natural selection,” have become household 
words and every-day conceptions. The reality and the im- 
portance of the natural processes on which Darwin founds 
his deductions are no more doubted than those of growth 
and multiplication ; and, whether the full potency attributed 
to them is admitted or not, no one doubts their vast and far- 
reaching significance. Wherever the biological sciences are 
studied, the ‘ Origin of Species ’ lights the path of the in- 
vestigator ; wherever they are taught it permeates the course 
of instruction. Nor has the influence of Darwinian ideas 
been less profound, beyond the realms of Biology. The 
oldest of all philosophies, that of Evolution, was bound hand 
and foot and cast into utter darkness during the millennium 
of theological scholasticism. But Darwin poured new life- 
blood into the ancient frame ; the bonds burst, and the 
revivified thought of ancient Greece has proved itself to be 
a more adequate expression of the universal order of things 
than any of the schemes which have been accepted by the 
credulity and welcomed by the superstition of seventy later 
generations of men. 

To any one who studies the signs of the times, the 
emergence of the philosophy of Evolution, in the attitude of 
claimant to the throne of the world of thought, from the 
limbo of hated and, as many hoped, forgotten things, is the 
most portentous event of the nineteenth century. But the 
most effective weapons of the modem champions of Evolution 
were fabricated by Darwin ; and the ‘ Origin of Species ' has 
enlisted a formidable body of combatants, trained in the se- 
vere school of Physical Science, whose ears might have long 
remained deaf to the speculations of a priori philosophers. 

I do not think that any candid or instructed person will 
deny the truth of that which has just been asserted. He may 
hate the very name of Evolution, and may deny its pretensions 
as vehemently as a Jacobite denied those of George the Second. 
But there it is — not only as solidly seated as the Hanoverian 



• ORIGIN OF SPECIES.’ 



l8l 

dynasty, but happily independent of Parliamentary sanction — 
and the dullest antagonists have come to see that they have 
to deal with an adversary whose bones are to be broken by 
no amount of bad words. 

Even the theologians have almost ceased to pit the plain 
meaning of Genesis against the no less plain meaning of 
Nature. Their more candid, or more cautious, representatives 
have given up dealing with Evolution as if it were a damnable 
heresy, and have taken refuge in one of two courses. Either 
they deny that Genesis was meant to teach scientific truth, 
and thus save the veracity of the record at the expense of its 
authority ; or they expend their energies in devising the cruel 
ingenuities of the reconciler, and torture texts in the vain 
hope of making them confess the creed of Science. But when 
the peine forte et dure is over, the antique sincerity of the vener- 
able sufferer always reasserts itself. Genesis is honest to the 
core, and professes to be no more than it is, a repository of 
venerable traditions of unknown origin, claiming no scientific 
authority and possessing none. 

As my pen finishes these passages, I can but be 
amused to think what a terrible hubbub would have been 
made (in truth was made) about any similar expressions of 
opinion a quarter of a century ago. In fact, the contrast 
between the present condition of public opinion upon the 
Darwinian question ; between the estimation in which 
Darwin’s views are now held in the scientific world ; between 
the acquiescence, or at least quiescence, of the theologians of 
the self-respecting order at the present day and the out- 
burst of antagonism on all sides in 1858-9, when the new 
theory respecting the origin of species first became known to 
the older generation to which I belong, is so startling that, 
except for documentary evidence, I should be sometimes 
inclined to think my memories dreams. I have a great 
respect for the younger generation myself (they can write our 
lives, and ravel out all our follies, if they choose to take the

trouble, by and by), and I should be glad to be assured that 
the feeling is reciprocal ; but I am afraid that the story of our 
dealings with Darwin may prove a great hindrance to that 
veneration for our wisdom which 1 should like them to dis- 
play. We have not even the excuse that, thirty years ago, 
Mr. Danvin was an obscure novice, who had no claims on our 
attention. On the contrary, his remarkable zoological and 
geological investigations had long given him an assured posi- 
tion among the most eminent and original investigators of 
the day ; while his charming ‘ Voyage of a Naturalist ’ had 
justly earned him a wide-spread reputation among the general 
public. I doubt if there was any man then living who had a 
better right to expect that anything he might choose to say 
on such a question as the Origin of Species would be listened 
to with profound attention, and discussed w'ith respect ; and 
there was certainly no man whose personal character should 
have afforded a better safeguard against attacks, instinct with 
malignity and spiced with shameless impertinences. 

Yet such was the portion of one of the kindest and truest 
men that it was ever my good fortune to know ; and years 
had to pass away before misrepresentation, ridicule, and 
denunciation, ceased to be the most notable constituents of 
the majority of the multitudinous criticisms of his work which 
poured from the press. I am loth to rake any of these ancient 
scandals from their well-deserved oblivion ; but I must make 
good a statement which may seem overcharged to the present 
generation, and there is no pike justificative more apt for the 
purpose, or more worthy of such dishonour, than the articie in

assailed Dr. Young, the world has seen no such specimen of 
the insolence of a shallow pretender to a Master in Science as 
this remarkable production, in which one of the most exact 
of observers, most cautious of rcasoners, and most candid of 
expositors, of this or any other age, is held up to scorn 
as a “ flighty " person, who endeavours “ to prop up his utterly 
rotten fabric of guess and speculation,” and whose “ mode of 
dealing with nature ” is reprobated as “ utterly dishonourable 
to Natural Science.” And all this high and mighty talk, which 
would have been indecent in one of Mr. Darwin’s equals, 
proceeds from a writer whose want of intelligence, or of con- 
science, or of both, is so great, that, by way of an objection to 
Mr. Darwin’s views, he can ask, “ Is it credible that all favour- 
able varieties of turnips are tending to become men ; ” who is 
so ignorant of paleontology, that he can talk of the “ flowers 
and fruits ” of the plants of the carboniferous epoch ; of com- 
parative anatomy, that he can gravely affirm the poison appa- 
ratus of the venomous snakes to be “ entirely separate from 
the ordinary laws of animal life, and peculiar to themselves 
of the rudiments of physiology, that he can ask, “ what 
advantage of life could alter the shape of the corpuscles into 
which the blood can be evaporated ? ” Nor does the reviewer 
fail to flavour this outpouring of preposterous incapacity with 
a little stimulation of the odium tlmlogicum. Some inkling 
of the history of the conflicts between Astronomy, Geology, 
and Theology, leads him to keep a retreat open by the 
proviso that he cannot “consent to test the truth of Natural 
Science by the word of Revelation ; ” but, for all that, he 
devotes pages to the exposition of his conviction that Mr. 
Darwin’s theory “contradicts the revealed relation of the 
creation to its Creator,” and is “ inconsistent with the fulness 
of his glory.” 

If I confine my retrospect of the reception of the ‘ Origin 
of Species ’ to a twelvemonth, or thereabouts, from the time

of its publication, I do not recollect anything quite so foolish 
and unmannerly as the ‘Quarterly Review’ article, unless, 
perhaps, the address of a Reverend Professor to the Dublin 
Geological Society might enter into competition with it But 
a large proportion of Mr. Darwin’s critics had a lamentable 
resemblance to the ‘Quarterly’ reviewer, in so far as they 
lacked either the will, or the wit, to make themselves masters 
of his doctrine ; hardly any possessed the knowledge required 
to follow him through the immense range of biological and 
geological science which the ‘ Origin ’ covered ; while, too 
commonly, they had prejudged the case on theological 
grounds, and, as seems to be inevitable when this happens, 
eked out lack of reason by superfluity of railing. 

But it will be more pleasant and more profitable to consider 
those criticisms, which were acknowledged by writers of 
scientific authority, or which bore internal evidence of the 
greater or less competency and, often, of the good faith, of 
their authors. Restricting my survey to a twelvemonth, or 
thereabouts, after the publication of the ‘ Origin,’ I find 
among such critics Louis Agassiz;* Murray, an excellent 
entomologist ; Harvey, a botanist of considerable repute ; 
and the author of an article in the * Edinburgh Review,’ all 
strongly adverse to Darwin. Pictet, the distinguished and 
widely learned paleontologist of Geneva, treats Mr. Darwin 
with a respect which forms a grateful contrast to the tone of

only a very little way.* On the other hand, Lyell, up to 
that time a pillar of the anti-transmutationists (who regarded 
him, ever afterwards, as Pallas Athene may have looked 
at Dian, after the Endymion affair), declared himself a 
Danvinian, though not without putting in a serious caveat. 
Nevertheless, he was a tower of strength, and his courageous 
stand for truth as against consistency, did him infinite 
honour. As evolutionists, sans phrase, I do not call to mind 
among the biologists more than Asa Gray, who fought the 
battle splendidly in the United States ; Hooker, who was no 
less vigorous here ; the present Sir John Lubbock and my- 
self. Wallace was far away in the Malay Archipelago ; but, 
apart' from his direct share in the promulgation of the 
theory of natural selection, no enumeration of the influences 
at work, at the time I am speaking of, would be com- 
plete without the mention of his powerful essay ‘ On the 
Law which has regulated the Introduction of New Species,' 
which was published in 1855. On reading it afresh, I have 
been astonished to recollect how small was the impression 
it made.

long time the effect of a conspiracy of silence ; and many 
years passed before the Academy redeemed itself from the 
reproach that the name of Darwin was not to be found on the 
list of its members. However, an accomplished writer, out of 
the range of academical influences, M. Laugel, gave an excel- 
lent and appreciative notice of the ‘Origin’ in the ‘Revue 
des Deux Mondes.’ Germany took time to consider ; Bronn 
produced a slightly Bowdlerized translation of the ‘ Origin ’ ; 
and ‘ Kladderadatsch ’ cut his jokes upon the ape origin of 
man ; but I do not call to mind that any scientific notability 
declared himself publicly in i86o.* None of us dreamed that, 
in the course of a few years, the strength (and perhaps I may add 
the weakness) of “ Darwinismus ” would have its most exten- 
sive and most brilliant illustrations in the land of learning. 
If a foreigner may presume to speculate on the cause of this 
curious interval of silence, I fancy it was that one moiety of 
the German biologists were orthodox at any price, and the 
other moiety as distinctly heterodox. The latter were evo- 
lutionists, a priori, already, and they must have felt the dis- 
gust natural to deductive philosophers at being offered an

they had reached by a shorter cut It is undoubtedly trying

demned by an overwhelming majority. And there is as little 
doubt that if such a council gathered now, the decree would

of sense, as well as of modesty, to ascribe to the men of that 
generation less capacity or less honesty than their successors 
possess. What, then, are the causes which led instructed and 
fair-judging men of that day to arrive at a judgment so 
different from that which seems just and fair to those who 
follow them ? That is really one of the most interesting of all 
questions connected with the history of science, and I shall 
try to answer it. I am afraid that in order to do so I must 
run the risk of appearing egotistical. However, if I tell my 
own story it is only because I know it better than that of 
other people. 

I think I must have read the ‘ Vestiges ’ before I left Eng- 
land in 1846 ; but, if I did, the book made very little impres- 
sion upon me, and I was not brought into serious contact with 
the ‘Species’ question until after 1850. At that time, I had 
long done with the Pentateuchal cosmogony, which had been 
impressed upon my childish understanding as Divine truth, 
with all the authority of parents and instructors, and from 
which it had cost me many a struggle to get free. But my 
mind was unbiassed in respect of any doctrine which presented 
itself, if it professed to be based on purely philosophical and 
scientific reasoning. It seemed to me then (as it does now) 
that “ creation,” in the ordinary sense of the word, is perfectly 
conceivable. I find no difficulty in imagining that, at some 
former period, this universe was not in existence ; and that 
it made its appearance in six days (or instantaneously, if 
that is preferred), in consequence of the volition of some pre- 
existent Being. Then, as now, the so-called a priori argu- 
ments against Theism, and, given a Deity, against the 
possibility of creative acts, appeared to me to be devoid of 
reasonable foundation. I had not then, and I have not now, 
the smallest a priori objection to raise to the account of the 
creation of animals and plants given in ‘ Paradise Lost,’ in 
which Milton so vividly embodies the natural sense of Genesis. 
Far be it from me to say that it is untrue because it is impos-

sible. I confine myself to what must be regarded as a modest 
and reasonable request for some particle of evidence that the 
existing species of animals and plants did originate in that 
way, as a condition of my belief in a statement which appears 
to me to be highly improbable. 

And, by way of being perfectly fair, I had exactly the 
same answer to give to the evolutionists of 1851-8. Within 
the ranks of the biologists, at that time, I met with nobody, 
except Dr. Grant, of University College, who had a word to say 
for Evolution — and his advocacy was not calculated to advance 
the cause. Outside these ranks, the only person known to me 
whose knowledge and capacity compelled respect, and who 
was, at the same time, a thorough-going evolutionist, was Mr. 
Herbert Spencer, whose acquaintance I made, I think, in 
1852, and then entered into the bonds of a friendship which, 
I am happy to think, has known no interruption. Many and 
prolonged were the battles we fought on this topic. But 
even my friend’s rare dialectic skill and copiousness of 
apt illustration could not drive me from my agnostic position. 
I took my stand upon two grounds : firstly, that up to that 
time, the evidence in favour of transmutation was wholly 
insufficient; and, secondly, that no suggestion respecting 
the causes of the transmutation assumed, which had been 
made, was in any way adequate to explain the phenomena. 
Looking back at the state of knowledge at that time, I 
really do not see that any other conclusion was justifiable. 

In those days I had never even heard of Treviranus’ 
■ Biologic.’ However, I had studied Lamarck attentively and 
I had read the ‘ Vestiges ’ with due care ; but neither of them 
afforded me any good ground for changing my negative 
and critical attitude. As for the ‘ Vestiges,’ I confess that 
the book simply irritated me by the prodigious ignorance 
and thoroughly unscientific habit of mind manifested by the 
writer. If it had any influence on me at all, it set me 
against Evolution ; and the only review I ever have qualms

of conscience about, on the ground of needless savagery, is 
one I wrote on the ‘ Vestiges ’ while under that influence. 

With respect to the ‘Philosophie Zoologique,’ it is no 
reproach to Lamarck to say that the discussion of the Species 
question in that work, whatever might be said for it in 1809, 
was miserably below the level of the knowledge of half a 
century later. In that interval of time the elucidation of 
the structure of the lower animals and plants had given rise 
to wholly new conceptions of their relations ; histology and 
embryology, in the modern sense, had been created ; physio- 
logy had been reconstituted ; the facts of distribution, 
geological and geographical, had been prodigiously multi- 
plied and reduced to order. To any biologist whose studies 
had carried him beyond mere species-mongering in 1850, one- 
half of Lamarck’s arguments were obsolete and the other 
half erroneous, or defective, in virtue of omitting to deal with 
the various classes of evidence which had been brought to 
light since his time. Moreover his one suggestion as to the 
cause of the gradual modifleation of species — effort excited 
by change of conditions — was, on the face of it, inapplicable to 
the whole vegetable world. I do not think that any impartial 
judge who reads the ‘ Philosophie Zoologique ’ now, and who 
aftenvards takes up Lyell’s trenchant and effectual criticism 
(published as far back as 1830), will be disposed to allot 
to Lamarck a much higher place in the establishment of 
biological evolution than that which Bacon assigns to himself 
in relation to physical science generally , — buccinator tautum.' 

But, by a curious irony of fate, the same influence which 
led me to put as little faith in modem speculations on this 
subject, as in the venerable traditions recorded in the first two 
chapters of Genesis, was perhaps more potent than any other

in keeping alive a sort of pious conviction that Evolution, 
after all, would turn out true. I have recently read afresh 
the first edition of the ‘Principles of Geology’ ; and when I 
•consider that this remarkable book had been nearly thirty 
years in everybody’s hands, and that it brings home to any 
reader of ordinary intelligence a great principle and a great 
fact — the principle, that the past must be explained by the 
present, unless good cause be shown to the contrary ; and the 
fact, that, so far as our knowledge of the past history of life 
on our globe goes, no such cause can be’ shown * — I cannot 
but believe that Lycll, for others, as for myself, was the chief 
agent in smoothing the road for Danvin. For consistent 
uniformitarianism postulates evolution as much in the organic 
as in the inorganic world. The origin of a new species by 
other than ordinary agencies would be a vastly greater 
“ catastrophe ” than any of those which Lyell successfully 
eliminated from sober geological speculation. 

In fact, no one was better aware of this than Lyell himselff

on the one hand, and to the ideal quasi-progressionism of 
Agassiz, on the other, Lyell, in his own mind, was strongly- 
disposed to account for the origination of all past and present 
species of living things by natural causes. But he would have 
liked, at the same time, to keep the name of creation for a 
natural process which he imagined to be incomprehensible. 

In a letter addressed to Mantell (dated March 2, 1827), 
Lyell speaks of having just read Lamarck ; he expresses his 
delight at Lamarck’s theories, and his personal freedom from 
any objections based on theological grounds. And though he 
is evidently alarmed at the pithecoid origin of man involved 
in Lamarck’s doctrine, he observes : — 

“ But, after all, what changes species may really undergo ! 
How impossible will it bo to distinguish and lay down a line, 
beyond which some of the so-called extinct species have 
never passed into recent ones.” 

Again, the following remarkable passage occurs in the post- 
script of a letter addressed to Sir John Herschel in 1836: — 
“In regard to the origination of new species, I am very 
glad to find that you think it probable that it may be carried 
on through the intervention of intermediate causes. I left this 
rather to be inferred, not thinking it worth while to- offend a 
certain class of persons by embodying in words what would 
only be a speculation.” ’* He goes on to refer to the criticisms 
which have been directed against him on the ground that, by 
leaving species to be originated by miracle, he is inconsistent 
with his own doctrine of uniformitarianism ; and he leaves it 



* In the same sense, see the letter 
to Whewell, March 7, 1837, vol. ii., 
P-5:— 

“ In regard to this last subject 
[the changes from one set of animal 
and vegetable species to another] . . ,

as plainly as he has done the possi- 
bility of the introduction or origina- 



tion of fresh species being a natural,

process, I should have raised a host 
of prejudices against me, which are 
unfortunately opposed at every step

address the public on these mys- 
terious subjects.” Sec also letter to

to be understood that he had not replied, on the ground of his 
general objection to controversy. 

Lyell’s contemporaries were not without some inkling of 
his esoteric doctrine. Whewell’s ‘ History of the Inductive 
Sciences,’ whatever its philosophical value, is always worth 
reading and always interesting, if under no other aspect than 
that of an evidence of the speculative limits within which a 
highly-placed divine might, at that time, safely range at 
will. In the course of his discussion of uniformitarianism, the 
encyclopaedic Master of Trinity observes : — 

" Mr. Lyell, indeed, has spoken of an hypothesis that ‘ the 
successive creation of species may constitute a regular part of 
the economy of nature,’ but he has nowhere, I think, so 
described this process as to make it appear in what depart- 
ment of science we are to place the hypothesis. Are these 
new species created by the production, at long intervals, of 
an offspring different in species from the parents ? Or are 
the species so created produced without parents ? Are they 
gradually evolved from some embryo substance Or do they 
suddenly start from the ground, as in the creation of the 
poet? . . . 

“ Some selection of one of these forms of the hypothesis, 
rather than the others, with evidence for the selection, is 
requisite to entitle us to place it among the known causes of 
change, which in this chapter we are considering. The bare 
conviction that a creation of species has taken place, whether 
once or many times, so long as it is unconnected with our 
organical sciences, is a tenet of Natural Theology ratlier 
than of Physical Philosophy.” * 

The earlier part of this criticism appears perfectly just and 
appropriate ; but, from the concluding paragraph, Whewell 
evidently imagines that by “ creation ” Lyell means a preter- 
natural intervention of the Deity ; whereas the letter to 
Herschel shows that, in his own mind, Lyell meant natural

causation ; and I see no reason to doubt * that, if Sir Charles 
could have avoided the inevitable corollary of the pithecoid 
origin of man — for which, to the end of his life, he entertained 
a profound antipathy — ^he would have advocated the efficiency 
of causes now in operation to bring about the condition of the 
organic world, as stoutly as he championed that doctrine in 
reference to inorganic nature. 

The fact is, that a discerning eye might have seen that 
some form or other of the doctrine of transmutation was 
inevitable, from the time when the truth enunciated by William

Smith, that successive strata are characterised by different 
kinds of fossil remains, became a firmly established law of 
nature. No one has set forth the speculative consequences 
of this generalisation better than the historian of the ‘ Induc- 
tive Sciences ’ : — 

“But the study of geology opens to us the spectacle of 
many groups of species which have, in the course of the earth’s 
history, succeeded each other at vast intervals of time ; one 
set of animals and plants disappearing, as it would seem, 
from the face of our planet, and others, which did not before 
exist, becoming the only occupants of the globe. And the 
dilemma then presents itself to us anew either we must 
accept the doctrine of the transmutation of species, and must 
suppose that the organized species of one geological epoch 
were transmuted into those of another by some long-con- 
tinued agency of natural causes ; or else, we must believe in 
many successive acts of creation and extinction of species, 
out of the common course of nature ; acts which, therefore, 
we may properly call miraculous.” • 

Dr. Whewell decides in favour of the latter conclusion. And 
if any one had plied him with the four questions which he 
puts to Lyell in the passage already cited, all that can be said 
now is that he would certainly have rejected the first But 
would he really have had the courage to say that a Rhinoceros 
iichorhinus, for instance, “ was produced without parents ; ” or 
was “evolved from some embryo substance;” or that it 
suddenly started from the ground like Milton’s lion “pawing 
to get free his hinder parts”? I permit myself to doubt 
whether even the Master of Trinity’s well-tried courage — 
physical, intellectual, and moral — would have been equal to 
this feat. No doubt the sudden concurrence of half-a-ton of 
inorganic molecules into a live rhinoceros is conceivable, and 
therefore may be possible. But does such an event lie

•sufficiently within the bounds of probability to justify the 
belief in its occurrence on the strength of any attainable, or, 
indeed, imaginable, evidence ? 

In view of the assertion (often repeated in the early days 
of the opposition to Darwin) that he had added nothing to 
Lamarck, it is very interesting to observe that the possibility 
of a fifth alternative, in addition to the four he has stated, has 
not dawned upon Dr. Whewell’s mind. The suggestion that 
new species may result from the selective action of external 
conditions upon the variations from their specific type which 
individuals present — and which we call “spontaneous," because 
we are ignorant of their causation — is as wholly unknown to 
the historian of scientific ideas as it was to biological spe- 
cialists before 1858. But that suggestion is the central idea 
of the ‘ Origin of Species,’ and contains the quintessence of 
Darwinism. 

Thus, looking back into the past, it seems to me that my 
o^vn position of critical expectancy was Just and reasonable, 
and must have been taken up, on the same grounds, by many 
other persons. If Agassiz told me that the forms of life 
which had successively tenanted the globe were the incarna- 
tions of successive thoughts of the Deity ; and that He had 
wiped out one set of these embodiments by an appalling 
geological catastrophe as soon as His ideas took a more 
advanced shape, I found myself not only unable to admit the 
accuracy of the deductions from the facts of paleontology, 
upon which this astounding hypothesis was founded, but I 
had to confess my want of any means of testing the correctness 
of his explanation^of them. And besides that, I could by no 
means see what the explanation e.xplained. Neither did it 
help me to be told [by an eminent anatomist that species had 
succeeded one another in time, in virtue of “ a continuously 
operative creational law.” That seemed to me to be no more 
than saying that species had succeeded one another, in the 
form of a vote-catching resolution, with "law” to please the

man of science, and “ creational ” to draw the orthodox. So 
I took refuge in that “ thiitige Skepsis ” which Goethe has so 
well defined ; and, reversing the apostolic precept to be all 
things to all men, I usually defended the tenability of the 
received doctrines, when I had to do with the transmuta- 
tionists ; and stood up for the possibility of transmutation 
among the orthodox — thereby, no doubt, increasing an already 
current, but quite undeserved, reputation for needless com- 
bativeness. 

I remember, in the course of my first interview with 
Mr. Darwin, e.xpressing my belief in the sharpness of the lines 
of demarcation between natural groups and in the absence 
of transitional forms, with all the confidence of youth and 
imperfect knowledge. I was not aware, at that time, that he 
had then been many years brooding over the species-ques- 
tion ; and the humorous smile which accompanied his gentle 
answer, that such was not altogether his view, long haunted 
and puzzled me. But it would seem that four or five years’ 
hard work had enabled me to understand what it meant ; 
for Lyell,* writing to Sir Charles Bunbury (under date of 
April 30, 1856), says; — 

“ When Huxley, Hooker, and Wollaston were at Darwin’s 
last week they (all four of them) ran a tilt against species — 
further, I believe, than they are prepared to go.” 

1 recollect nothing of this beyond the fact of meeting Mr. 
Wollaston ; and except for Sir Charles’ distinct assurance 
as to " all four,” I should have thought my outrecuidance was 
probably a counterblast to Wollaston’s conservatism. With 
regard to Hooker, he was already, like Voltaire’s Habakkuk, 
"capable de tout" in the way of advocating Evolution. 

As I have already said, I imagine that most of those of my 
contemporaries who thought seriously about the matter, were 
very much in my own state of mind — inclined to say to 
both Mosaists and Evolutionists, “ a plague on both your

houses ! ” and disposed to turn aside from an interminable and 
apparently fruitless discussion, to labour in the fertile fields 
of ascertainable fact. And I may, therefore, further suppose 
that the publication of the Darwin and Wallace papers in 
1858, and still more that of the ‘ Origin ’ in 1859, had tlie 
effect upon them of the flash of light, which to a man who 
has lost himself in a dark night, suddenly reveals a road 
which, whether it takes him straight home or not, certainly 
goes his way. That which we were looking for, and could 
not find, was a hypothesis respecting the origin of known 
oiganic forms, which assumed the operation of no causes but 
such as could be proved to be actually at work. We wanted, 
not to pin our faith to that or any other speculation, but to 
get hold of clear and definite conceptions which could be 
brought face to face with facts and have their validity tested. 
The ‘Origin’ provided us with the working hypothesis we 
sought. Moreover, it did the immense service of freeing 
us for ever from the dilemma — refuse to accept the creation 
hypothesis, and what have you to propose that can be accepted 
by any cautious reasoncr? In 1857, I had no answer ready, 
and I do not think that any one else had. A year later, we 
reproached ourselves with dulness for being perplexed by 
.such an inquiry. My reflection, when I first made myself 
master of the central idea of the ‘ Origin,’ was, “ How ex- 
tremely stupid not to have thought of that ! " I suppose that 
Columbus’ companions said much the same when he made 
the egg stand on end. The facts of variability, of the struggle 
for existence, of adaptation to conditions, were notorious 
enough ; but none of us had suspected that the road to the 
heart of the species problem lay through them, until Darwin 
and Wallace dispelled the darkness, and the beacon-fire of 
the ‘ Origin ’ guided the benighted. 

Whether the particular shape which the doctrine of evolu- 
tion, as applied to the organic world, took in Darwin’s hands, 
would prove to be final or not, was, to me, a matter of indifier-

ence. In my earliest criticisms of the ‘ Origin ’ I ventured to- 
point out that its logical foundation was insecure so long as. 
experiments in selective breeding had not produced varieties 
which were more or less infertile ; and that insecurity remains 
up to the present time. But, with any and every critical doubt 
which my sceptical ingenuity could suggest, the Darwinian 
hypothesis remained incomparably more probable than the 
creation hypothesis. And if we had none of us been able ta 
discern the paramount significance of some of the most patent 
and notorious of natural facts, until they were, so to speak, 
thrust under our noses, what force remained in the dilemma — 
creation or nothing? It was obvious that, hereafter, the 
probability would be immensely greater, that the links of 
natural causation were hidden from our purblind eyes, than 
that natural causation should be incompetent to produce ail 
the phenomena of nature. The only rational course for those 
who had no other object than the attainment of truth, was to 
accept “ Darwinism ” as a working hypothesis, and see what 
could be made of it Either it would prove its capacity to 
elucidate the facts of organic life, or it would break down under 
the strain. This was surely the dictate of common sense 
and, for once, common sense carried the day. The result has 
been that complete volte-face of the whole scientific world, 
which must seem so surprising to the present generation. I 
do not mean to say that all the leaders of biological science 
have avowed themselves Dar^vinians ; but I do not think 
that there is a single zoologist, or botanist, or palmontologist, 
among the multitude of active workers of this generation, 
who is other than an evolutionist, profoundly influenced by 
Danvin’s views. Whatever may be the ultimate fate of the 
particular theory put forth by Danvin, I venture to affirm that,, 
so far as my knowledge goes, all the ingenuity and all the 
learning of hostile critics has not enabled them to adduce a 
solitary fact, of which it can be said, this is irreconcilable with 
the Darwinian theory. In the prodigious variety and com-

plexity of organic nature, there arc multitudes of phenomena 
which are not deduciblc from any generalisations we have yet 
reached. But the same may be said of every other class of 
natural objects. I believe that astronomers cannot yet get 
the moon’s motions into perfect accordance with the theory 
of gravitation. 



It would be inappropriate, even if it were possible, to dis- 
cuss the difficulties and unresolved problems which have 
hitherto met the evolutionist, and which will probably continue 
to puzzle him for many generations to come, in the course of 
this brief history of the reception of Mr. Darwin’s great work. 
But there are two or three objections of a more general 
character, based, or supposed to be based, upon philosophical 
and theological foundations, which were loudly expressed in 
the early days of the Darwinian controversy, and which, 
though they have been answered over and over again, crop 
up now and then at the present day. 

The most singular of these, perhaps immortal, fallacies, 
which live bn, Tithonus-like, when sense and force have long 
deserted them, is that which charges Mr. Darwin with having 
attempted to reinstate the old pagan goddess. Chance. It is 
said that he supposes variations to come about “ by chance,” 
and that the fittest survive the “ chances ” of the struggle for 
existence, and thus “chance” is substituted for providential 
design. 

It is not a little wonderful that such an accusation as this 
should be brought against a writer who has, over and over 
again, warned his readers that when he uses the word “ spon- 
taneous,” he merely means that he is ignorant of the cause of 
that which is so termed ; and whose whole theory crumbles 
to pieces if the uniformity and regularity of natural causation 

for illimitable past ages is denied. But prnbiiMy tlir lunl 

answer to those who talk of Darwinism mciatlngltlic 
“ chance,” is to ask them what they thems^veirfnderstand by

"chance.’’ Do they believe that anything in this universe 
happens without reason or without a cause ? Do they really 
conceive that any event has no cause, and could not have 
been predicted by any one who had a sufficient insight into 
the order of Nature? If they do, it is they who are the 
inheritors of antique superstition and ignorance, and whose 
minds have never been illumined by a ray of scientific 
thought The one act of faith in the convert to science, is 
the confession of the universality of order and of the absolute 
validity, in all times and under all circumstances, of the law 
of causation. This confession is an act of faith, because, 
by the nature of the case, the truth of such propositions is 
not susceptible of proof. But such faith is not blind, but 
reasonable ; because it is invariably confirmed by experi- 
ence, and constitutes the sole trustworthy foundation for all 

If one of these people, in whom the chance-worship of our 
remoter ancestors thus strangely survives, should be within 
reach of the sea when a heavy gale is blowing, let him betake 
himself to the shore and watch the scene. Let him note the 
infinite variety of form and size of the tossing waves out at 
sea ; or of the curves of their foam-crested breakers, as they 
dash against the rocks ; let him listen to the roar and scream 
of the shingle as it is cast up and torn down the beach ; or 
look at the flakes of foam as they drive hither and thither 
before the wind ; or note the play of colours, which answers 
a gleam of sunshine as it falls upon their myriad bubbles. 
Surely here, if anywhere, he will say that chance is supreme, 
and bend the knee as one who has entered the very penetralia 
of his divinity. But the man of science knows that here, as 
everywhere, perfect order is manifested ; that there is not a 
curve of the waves, not a note in the howling chorus, not a 
rainbow-glint on a bubble, which is other than a necessary 
consequence of the ascertained laws of nature ; and that with 
a sufficient knowledge of the conditions, competent physico-

mathematical skill could account for, and indeed predict, 
every one of these “ chance ” events. 

A second very common objection to Mr. Darwin’s views 
was (and is), that they abolish Teleology, and eviscerate the 
argument from design. It is nearly twenty years since I 
ventured to offer some remarks on this subject, and as my 
arguments have as yet received no refutation, 1 hope I may 
be excused for reproducing them. I observed, “ that the doc- 
trine of Evolution is the most formidable opponent of all the 
commoner and coarser forms of Teleology. But perhaps the 
most remarkable service to the philosophy of Biology ren- 
dered by Mr. Darwin is the reconciliation of Teleology and 
Morphology, and the explanation of the facts of both, which 
his views offer. The teleology which supposes that the eye, 
such as we see it in man, or one of the higher vertebrata, was 
made with the precise structure it exhibits, for the purpose of 
enabling the animal which possesses it to see, has undoubtedly 
received its death-blow. Nevertheless, it is necessary to re- 
member that there is a wider teleology which is not touched 
by the doctrine of Evolution, but is actually based upon the 
fundamental proposition of Evolution. This proposition is 
that the whole world, living and not living, is the result of the 
mutual interaction, according to definite laws, of the forces • 
possessed by the molecules of which the primitive nebulosity 
of the universe was composed. If this be true, it is no less 
certain that the existing world lay potentially in the cosmic 
vapour, and that a sufficient intelligence could, from a know- 
ledge of the properties of the molecules of that vapour, have 
predicted, say the state of the fauna of Britain in 1869, with 
as much certainty as one can say what will happen to the 
vapour of the breath on a cold winter's day. .... 

.... The teleological and the mechanical views of nature 
arc not, necessarily, mutually exclusive. On the contrary, the 
more purely a mechanist the speculator is, the more firmly 
• I should now like to substitute the word powers for “ forces.”

does he assume a primordial molecular arrangement of which 
all the phenomena of the universe arc the consequences,, 
and the more completely is he thereby at the mercy of the 
telcologist, who can always defy him to disprove that this 
primordial molecular arrangement was not intended to evolve 
the phenomena of the universe.” • 

The acute champion of Teleology, Paley, saw no difficulty 
in admitting that the “production of things” may be the 
result of trains of mechanical dispositions fixed beforehand 
by intelligent appointment and kept in action by a power at 
the centre, t that is to say, he proleptically accepted the modem 
doctrine of Evolution ; and his successors might do well to 
follow their leader, or at any rate to attend to his weighty 
reasonings, before rushing into an antagonism which has no 
reasonable foundation. 

Having got rid of the belief in chance and the disbelief in 
design, as in no sense appurtenances of Evolution, tire third 
libel upon that doctrine, that it is anti-theistic, might perhaps 
be left to shift for itself. But the persistence with which 
many people refuse to draw the plainest consequences from 
the propositions they profess to accept, renders it advisable 
to remark that the doctrine of Evolution is neither Anti- 
theistic nor Theistic. It simply has no more to do with Theism 
than the first book of Euclid has. It is quite certain that a 
normal fresh-laid egg contains neither cock nor hen ; and it 
is also as certain as any proposition in physics or morals, that 
if such an egg is kept under proper conditions for three 
weeks, a cock or hen chicken will be found in it It is also 
quite certain that if the shell were transparent we should be 
able to watch the formation of the young fowl, day by day,, 
by a process of evolution, from a microscopic cellular germ 
to its full size and complication of structure. Therefore

Evolution, in the strictest sense, is actually going on in this 
and analogous millions and millions of instances, wherever 
living creatures exist. Therefore, to borrow an argument 
from Butler, as that which now happens must be consistent 
with the attributes of the Deity, if such a Being exists. 
Evolution must be consistent with those attributes. And, if 
so, the evolution of the universe, which is neither more nor less 
explicable than that of a chicken, must also be consistent 
with them. The doctrine of Evolution, therefore, does not 
even come into contact with Theism, considered as a philo- 
sophical doctrine. That with which it does collide, and with 
which it is absolutely inconsistent, is the conception of 
creation, which theological speculators have based upon the 
history narrated in the opening of the book of Genesis. 

There is a greal deal of talk and not a little lamentation 
about the so-called religious difHcuIties which physical science 
has created. In theological science, as a matter of fact, it 
has created none. Not a solitary problem presents itself to 
the philosophical Theist, at the present day, which has not 
existed from the time that philosophers began to think out 
the logical grounds and the logical consequences of Theism. 
All the real or imaginary perplexities which flow from the 
conception of the universe as a determinate mechanism, are 
equally involved in the assumption of an Eternal, Omnipotent 
and Omniscient Deity. The theological equivalent of the 
scientific conception of order is Providence ; and the doctrine 
of determinism follows as surely from the attributes of fore- 
knowledge assumed by the theologian, as from the universality 
of natural causation assumed by the man of science. The 
angels in * Paradise Lost ’ would have found the task of en- 
lightening Adam upon the mysteries of “ Fate, Foreknow- 
ledge, and Free-will,” not a whit more difficult, if their pupil 
had been educated in a " Real-schule ” and trained in every 
laboratory of a modem university. In respect of the great 
problems of Philosophy, the post-Darwinian generation is.

in one sense, exactly where the prae-Darwinian generations 
were. They remain insoluble. But the present generation 
has the advantage of being better provided with the means 
of freeing itself from the tyranny of certain sham solutions. 

The known is finite, the unknown infinite ; intellectually 
we stand on an islet in the midst of an illimitable ocean 
of inexplicability. Our business in every generation is to 
reclaim a little more land, to add something to the extent 
and the solidity of our possessions. And even a cursory 
glance at the history of the biological sciences during the 
last quarter of a century is sufficient to justify the assertion, 
that the most potent instrument for the extension of the 
realm of natural knowledge which has come into men’s hands, 
since the publication of Newton’s ‘Principia,’ is Danvin's 
‘ Origin of Species.’ 

It was badly received by the generation to which it was 
first addressed, and the outpouring of angry nonsense to which 
it gave rise is sad to think upon. But the present generation 
will probably behave just as badly if another Danvin should 
arise, and inflict upon them that which the generality of man- 
kind most hate — the necessity of revising their convictions. 
Let them, then, be charitable to us ancients ; and if they 
behave no better than the men of my day to some new 
benefactor, let them recollect that, after all, our wrath did not 
come to much, and vented itself chiefly in the bad language 
of sanctimonious scolds. Let them as speedily perform a 
strategic right-about-face, and follow the truth wherever it 
leads. The opponents of the new truth will discover, as those 
of Darwin are doing, that, after all, theories do not alter facts, 
and that the universe remains unaffected even though texts 
crumble. Or, it may be, that, as history repeats itself, their 
happy ingenuity will also discover that the new wine is 
exactly of the same vintage as the old, and that (rightly 
viewed) the old bottles prove to have been expressly made 
for holding it.

1859. 

[Under the date of October ist, 1859, !n my father’s Diary 
occurs the entry : “ Finished proofs (thirteen months and ten 
days)of Abstract on ‘Origin of Species’; 1230 copies printed. 
The first edition was published on November 24th, and all 
copies sold first day.” 

On October 2nd he started for a water-cure establishment 
at Ilkley, near Leeds, where he remained with his family 
until December, and on the 9th of that month he was again 
at Down. The only other entry in the Diary for this year 
is as follows : “ During end of November and beginning of 
December, employed in correcting for second edition of 3000 
copies ; multitude of letters.” 

The first and a few of the subsequent letters refer to proof 
sheets, and to early copies of the ‘ Origin ’ which were sent to 
friends before the book was published.]

persuade you to publish it without waiting for a time which 
probably could never have arrived, though you lived till the 
age of a hundred, when you had prepared all your facts on 
which you ground so many grand generalizations. 

It is a splendid case of close reasoning, and long substan- 
tial argument throughout so many pages ; the condensation 
immense, too great perhaps for the uninitiated, but an effective 
and important preliminary statement, which will admit, even 
before your detailed proofs appear, of some occasional useful 
exemplification, such as your pigeons and cirripedes, of which 
you make such excellent use. 

I mean that, when, as I fully expect, a new edition is soon 
called for, you may here and there insert an actual case to 
relieve the vast number of abstract propositions. So far as 
I am concerned, I am so well prepared to take your state- 
ments of facts for granted, that I do not think the "pieces 
justificatives ” when published will make much difference, and 
1 have long seen most clearly that if any concession is made, 
all that you claim in your concluding pages will follow. It 
is this which has made me so long hesitate, always feeling 
that the case of Man and his races, and of other animals, and 
that of plants is one and the same, and that if a “ vera causa ” 
be admitted for one, instead of a purely unknown and imagin- 
ary one, such as the word “ Creation,” all the consequences 
must follow. 

I fear I have not time to-day, as I am just leaving this 
place, to indulge in a variety of comments, and to say how 
much I was delighted with Oceanic Islands — Rudimentary 
Organs — Embryology — the genealogical key to the Natural 
System, Geographical Distribution, and if I went on I should 
be copying the heads of all your chapters. But I will say a 
word of tlie Recapitulation, in case some slight alteration, 
or, at least, omission of a word or two be still possible in 
that.

the most eminent naturalists have rejected the view of the 
mutability of species ? You do not mean to ignore G. St 
Hilaire and Lamarck. As to the latter, you may say, that in 
regard to animals you substitute natural selection for volition 
to a certain considerable extent, but in his theory of the 
changes of plants he could not introduce volition ; he may, 
no doubt, have laid an undue comparative stress on changes 
in physical conditions, and too little on those of contending 
organisms. He at least was for the universal mutability of 
species and for a genealogical link between the first and the 
present. The men of his school also appealed to domestic- 
ated varieties. (Do you mean living naturalists ?) * 

The first page of this most important summary gives the 
adversary an advantage, by putting forth so abruptly and 
crudely such a startling objection as the formation of " the 
eye,” not by means analogous to man’s reason, or rather by 
some power immeasurably superior to human reason, but 
by superinduced variation like those of which a cattle-breeder 
avails himself. Pages would be required thus to state an 
objection and remove it It would be better, as you wish to 
persuade, to say nothing. Leave out several sentences, and 
in a future edition bring it out more fully. Between the 
throwing down of such a stumbling-block in the way of the 
reader, and the passage to the working ants, in p. 460, there 
are pages required ; and these ants are a bathos to him before 
he has recovered from the shock of being called upon to 
believe the eye to have been brought to perfection, from a 
state of blindness or purblindness, by such variations as we 
witness. I think a little omission would greatly lessen the 
objectionableness of these sentences if you have not time to 
recast and amplify.

much of your valuable time in writing me the long letter of

proof-sheet to Scarborough. I have adopted most thankfully 
all your minor corrections in the last chapter, and the greater

the gradations in structure of the eye) by putting merely

Madeira and Bermuda Birds not peculiar. — You arc right, 
there is a screw out here ; I thought no one would have 
detected it; I blundered in omitting a discussion, which 
I have written out in full. But once for all, let me say as an 
excuse, that it was most difficult to decide what to omit. 
Birds, which have struggled in their own homes, when settled 
in a body, nearly simultaneously in a new country, would not 
be subject to much modification, for their mutual relations 
would not be much disturbed. But I quite agree with you, 
that in time they ought to undergo some. In Bermuda and 
Madeira they have, as I believe, been kept constant by the 
frequent arrival, and the crossing with unaltered immigrants 
of the same species from the main land. In Bermuda this 
can be proved, in Madeira highly probable, as shown me by 
letters from E. V. Harcourt. Moreover, there are ample ground, 
for believing that the crossed offspring of the new immigrants 
(fresh blood as breeders would say), and old colonists of the 
same species would be extra vigorous, and would be the most 
likely to survive ; thus the effects of such crossing in keeping 
the old colonists unaltered would be much aided. 

On Galapagos productions having American type on view 
of Creation. — I cannot agree with you, that species if created 
to struggle with American forms, would have to be created on 
the American type. Facts point diametrically the other way. 
Look at the unbroken and untilled ground in La Plata, 
covered with European products, which have no near affinity 
to the indigenous products. They are not American types 
which conquer the aborigines. So in every island throughout 
the world. Alph. De Candolle’s result (though he does not 
see its full importance), that thoroughly well naturalised 
(plants] are in general very different from the aborigines 
(belonging in large proportion of cases to non-indigenous 
genera) is most important always to bear in mind. Once 
for all, I am sure, you will understand that I thus write 
dogmatically for brevity sake.

On t]ie continued Creation of Monads. — This doctrine is 
.superfluous (and groundless) on the theory of Natural Selec- 
tion, which implies no necessary tendency to progression. A 
monad, if no deviation in its structure profitable to it under 
its excessively simple conditions of life occurred, might remain 
unaltered from long before the Silurian Age to the present 
day. I grant there will generally be a tendency to advance 
in complexity of organisation, though in beings fitted for very 
simple conditions it w'ould be slight and slow. How could 
a complex organisation profit a monad ? if it did not profit 
it there would be no advance. The Secondary Infusoria differ 
but little from the living. The parent monad form might 
perfectly well survive unaltered and fitted for its simple 
conditions, whilst the offspring of this very monad might 
become fitted for more complex conditions. The one prim- 
ordial prototype of all living and extinct creatures may, 
it is possible, be now alive! Moreover, as you say, higher 
forms might be occasionally degraded, the snake Typhlops 
seems (? !) to have the habits of earth-worms. So that fresh 
creations of simple forms seem to me wholly superfluous. 

“ Must you not assume a primeval creative power which 
does not cut with uniformity, or how could man supervene /” — 
I am not sure that I understand your remarks which follow 
the above. We must, under present knowledge, assume the 
creation of one or of a few forms in the same manner as philo- 
sophers assume the existence of a power of attraction without 
any explanation. But I entirely reject, as in my judgment 
quite unnecessary, any subsequent addition “ of new powers 
and attributes and forces or of any “ principle of improve- 
ment,” except in so far as every character which is naturally 
selected or preserved is in some way an advantage or improve- 
ment, otherwise it would not have been selected. If I were 
convinced that I required such additions to the theory of 
natural selection, I would reject it as rubbish, but I have firm 
faith in it, as I cannot believe, that if false, it would explain so 



(c) The Complete Work of Charles Darwin Online 



many whole classes of facts, which, if I am in my senses, it 
seems to explain. As far as I understand your remarks and 
illustrations, you doubt the possibility, of gradations of intel- 
lectual powers. Now, it seems to me, looking to existing 
animals alone, that we have a very fine gradation in the intel- 
lectual powers of the Vertebrata, with one rather wide gap (not 
half so wide as in many cases of corporeal structure), between 
say a Hottentot and an Ourang, even if civilised as much 
mentally as the dog has been from the wolf. I suppose that 
you do not doubt that the intellectual powers are as important 
for the welfare of each being as corporeal structure ; if so, I 
can see no difficulty in the most intellectual individuals of a 
species being continually selected ; and the intellect of the 
new species thus improved, aided probably by effects of 
inherited mental exercise. I look at this process as now 
going on with the races of man ; the less intellectual races 
being exterminated. But there is not space to discuss this 
point. If I understand you, the turning-point in our difference 
must be, that you think it impossible that the intellectual 
powers of a species should be much improved by the con- 
tinued natural selection of the most intellectual individuals. 
To show how minds graduate, just reflect how impossible 
every one has yet found it, to define tlie difference in mind 
of man and the lower animals ; the latter seem to have the 
very same attributes in a much lower stage of perfection than 
the lowest savage. I would give absolutely nothing for the 
theory of Natural Selection, if it requires miraculous additions 
at any one stage of descent. 1 think Embryology, Homo- 
l°Sy> Classification, &c &c., show us that all vertebrata have 
descended from one parent ; how that parent appeared we 
know not. If you admit in ever so little a degree, the 
explanation which I have given of Embryology, Homology 
and Classification, you will find it difficult to say : thus far 
the explanation holds good, hut no further; here we must 
call in “the addition of new creative forces.” I think you

will be driven to reject all or admit all : I fear by your letter 
it will be the former alternative ; and in that case I shall feel 
sure it is my fault, and not the theory’s fault, and this will 
certainly comfort me. With regard to the descent of the 
great Kingdoms (as Vertebrata, Articulata, &c.) from one 
parent, I have said in the conclusion, that mere analogy 
makes me think it probable ; my arguments and facts are 
sound in my judgment only for each separate kingdom. 

The forms which are beaten inluriting some inferiority in 
common. — I dare say I have not been guarded enough, but 
might not the term inferiority include less perfect adaptation 
to physical conditions .> 

My remarks apply not to single species, but to groups or 
genera ; the species of most genera are adapted at least to 
rather hotter, and rather less hot, to rather damper and dryer 
climates ; and when the several species of a group are beaten 
and exterminated by the several species of another group, it 
will not, I think, generally be from each new species being 
adapted to the climate, but from all the new species having 
some common advantage in obtaining sustenance, or escaping 
enemies. As groups arc concerned, a fairer illustration than 
negro and white in Liberia would be the almost certain future 
extinction of the genus ourang by the genus man, not owing 
to man being better fitted for the climate, but owing to the 
inherited intellectual inferiority of the Ourang-genus to Man- 
genus, by his intellect, inventing fire-arms and cutting down 
forests. I believe, from reasons given in my discussion, that 
acclimatisation is readily effected under nature. It has taken 
me so many years to disabuse my mind of the too great import- 
ance of climate — its important influence being so conspicuous, 
whilst that of a struggle between creature and creature is so 
hidden — that I am inclined to swear at the North Pole, and 
as Sydney Smith said, even to speak disrespectfully .of the 
Equator. I beg you often to reflect (I have found nothing 
so instructive) on the case of thousands of plants in the

middle point of their respective ranges, and which, as we 
positively know, can perfectly well withstand a little more 
heat and cold, a little more damp and dry, but which in 
the metropolis of their range do not exist in vast numbers, 
although, if many of the other inhabitants were destroyed 
[they] would cover the ground. We thus clearly see that 
their numbers are kept down, in almost every case, not by 
climate, but by the struggle with other organisms. All this 
you will perhaps think very obvious ; but, until I repeated it 
to myself thousands of times, I took, as I believe, a wholly 
wrong view of the whole economy of nature. . . . 

Hybridism . — I am so much pleased that you approve of 
this chapter ; you would be astonished at the labour this 
cost me ; so often was I, on what I believe was, the wrong 

Rudimentary Organs . — On the theory of Natural Selection 
there is a wide distinction between Rudimentary Organs and 
what you call germs of organs, and what I call in my bigger 
book “nascent” organs. An organ should not be called rudi- 
mentary unless it be useless — as teeth which never cut through 
the gums — the papillm, representing the pistil in male flowers, 
wing of Apteryx, or better, the little wings under soldered 
elytra. These organs are now plainly useless, and <J fortiori, 
they would be useless in a less developed state. Natural Selec- 
tion acts exclusively by preserving successive slight, useful 
modifleations. Hence Natural Selection cannot possibly make 
a useless or rudimentary organ. Such organs are solely due 
to inheritance (as explained in my discussion), and plainly 
bespeak an ancestor having the organ in a useful condition. 
They may be, and often have been, worked in for other pur- 
poses, and then they are only rudimentary for the original 
function, which is sometimes plainly apparent. A nascent 
organ, though little developed, as it has to be developed must 
be useful in every stage of development. As we cannot 
prophesy, we cannot tell what organs arc now nascent ; and

nascent organs will rarely have been handed down by certain 
members of a class from a remote period to the present day, 
for beings with any important organ but little developed, will 
generally have been supplanted by their descendants with the 
organ well developed. The mammary glands in Ornitho- 
rhynchus may, perhaps, be considered as nascent compared 
with the udders of a cow — Ovigerous frena, in certain cirripedcs, 
are nascent branchiae — in [illegible] the swim bladder is almost 
rudimentary for this purpose, and is nascent as a lung. The 
small wing of penguin, used only as a fin, might be nascent 
as a wing ; not that I think so ; for the whole structure of the 
bird is adapted for flight, and a penguin so closely resembles 
other birds, that we may infer that its wings have probably 
been modified, and reduced by natural selection, in accordance 
with its sub-aquatic habits. Analogy thus often serves as a 
guide in distinguishing whether an organ is rudimentary or 
nascent I believe the Os coccyx gives attachment to certain 
muscles, but I cannot doubt that it is a rudimentary tail. 
The bastard wing of birds is a rudimentary digit ; and I 
believe that if fossil birds are found very low down in the 
series, they will be seen to have a double or bifurcated wing. 
Here is a bold prophecy 1 

To admit prophetic germs, is tantamount to rejecting the 
theory of Natural Selection. 

I am very glad you think it worth while to run through my 
book again, as much, or more, for the subject’s sake as for my 
own sake. But I look at your keeping the subject for some 
little time before your mind — raising your own difficulties 
and solving them — as far more important than reading my 
book. If you think enough, I expect you will be perverted, 
and if you ever are, I shall know that the theory of Natural 
Selection is, in the main, safe ; that it includes, as now put 
forth, many errors, is almost certain, though I cannot see 
them. Do not, of course, think of answering this ; but if you have 
other occasion to write again, just say whether I have, in ever

Down, November nth [1859]. 

My dear Sir, — I have ventured to send you a copy of my 
book (as yet only an abstract) on the ‘Origin of Species.’ 
As the conclusions at which I have arrived on several points 
differ so widely from yours, I have thought (should you at 
any time read my volume) that you might think that I had 
sent it to you out of a spirit of defiance or bravado ; but I 
assure you that I act under a wholly different frame of mind. 
I hope that you will at least give me credit, however erro- 
neous you may think my conclusions, for having earnestly 
endeavoured to arrive at the truth. With sincere respect, 
I beg leave to remain. 

Yours very faithfully, 

Charles Darwin.

He emigrated to America in 1846,

a letter to Agassiz (1850) is worth 
giving, as showing how my father 
regarded him, and it may be added 
that his cordial feelings towards the

strong to the end of his life : —

Dear Sir, — I have thought that you would permit me to 
send you (by Messrs. Williams and Norgate, booksellers) 
a copy of my work (as yet only an abstract) on the ‘ Origin 
of Species.’ I wish to do this, as the only, though quite 
inadequate manner, by which I can testify to you the extreme 
interest which I have felt, and the great advantage which I 
have derived, from studying your grand and noble work on 
Geographical Distribution. Should you be induced to read 
my volume, I venture to remark that it will be intelligible 
only by reading the whole straight through, as it is very much 
condensed. It would be a high gratification to me if any 
portion interested you. But I am perfectly well aware that 
you will entirely disagree with the conclusion at which I have

a copy of my book on the ‘ Origin of Species,’ which as yet 
is only an abstract 

If you read it, you must read it straight through, otherwise 
from its extremely condensed state it will be unintelligible.

a degree, in this case, I am fully convinced that you will 
become, year after year, less fixed in your belief in the immut- 
ability of species. With this audacious and presumptuous 
conviction, 

I remain, my dear Falconer,

C. Darwin to Asa Gray. 

Down, November nth [1859]. 

My dear Gray, — I have directed a copy of my book (as 
yet only an abstract) on the ‘ Origin of Species ’ to be sent 
you. I know how you are pressed for time ; but if you can 
read it, I shall be infinitely gratified .... If ever you 
do read it, and can screw out time to send me (as I value 
your opinion so highly), however short a note, telling me 
what you think its weakest and best parts, I should be ex- 
tremely grateful. As you are not a geologist, you will excuse 
my conceit in telling you that Lyell highly approves of the 
two Geological chapters, and thinks that on the Imperfection 
of the Geological Record not e.xaggerated. He is nearly 
a convert to my views 

Let me add I fully admit that there are very many diffi- 
culties not satisfactorily explained by my theory of descent 
with modification, but I cannot possibly believe that a false 
theory would explain so many classes of facts as I think it 
certainly does explain. On these grounds I drop my anchor, 
and believe that the difficulties will slowly disappear. . . ,

Historj' ; I fear, however, that you will not approve of your 
pupil in this case. The book in its present state does not 
show the amount of labour which I have bestowed on the 
subject. 

If you have time to read it carefully, and would take the 
trouble to point out what parts seem weakest to you and 
what best, it would be a most material aid to me in writing 
my bigger book, which I hope to commence in a few months. 
You know also how highly I value your judgment But I 
am not so unreasonable as to wish or expect you to write 
detailed and lengthy criticisms, but merely a few general 
remarks, pointing out the weakest parts. 

If you are in even so slight a degree staggered (which I 
hardly expect) on the immutability of species, then I am 
convinced with further reflection you will become more and 
more staggered^ for this has been the process through which 
my mind has gone. My dear Henslow, 

Yours affectionately and gratefully,

Saturday [November 12th, 1859]. 

. . . Thank you much for asking me to Brighton. I hope 
much that you will enjoy your holiday. I have told Murray 
to send a copy for you to Mansion House Street, and I am 
surprised that you have not received it. There are so many 
valid and weighty arguments against my notions, that you, 
or any one, if you wish on the other side, will easily persuade 
yourself that I am wholly in error, and no doubt I am in part 
in error, perhaps wholly so, though I cannot see the blindness 
of my ways. I dare say when thunder and lightning were 
first proved to be due to secondary causes, some regretted to

Ilkley, Yorkshire, 
Tuesday [November 15th, 1859]. 

My dear Lubbock, — ;! beg pardon for troubling you 
again. I do not know how I blundered in expressing myself 
in making you believe that we accepted your kind invitation 
to Brighton. I meant merely to thank you sincerely for 
wishing to see such a worn-out old.dog as myself. I hardly 
know when we leave this place, — not under a fortnight, and 
then we shall wish to rest under our own roof-tree. 

I do not think I hardly ever admired a book more than 
Paley’s ‘Natural Theology.’ I could almost formerly have 
said it by heart. 

I am glad you have got my book, but I fear that you value 
it far too highly. I should be grateful for any critieisms. I 
care not for Reviews ; but for the opinion of men like you 
and Hooker and Huxley and Lyell, &c. 

Farewell, with our joint thanks to Mrs. Lubbock and

here for another fortnight at least. Please remember that my 
book is only an abstract, and very much condensed, and, to 
be at all intelligible, must be carefully read. I shall be very 
grateful for any criticisms. But I know perfectly well that 
you will not at all agree with tlic lengths which I go. It took 
long years to convert me. I may, of course, be egregiously 
wrong ; but I cannot persuade myself that a theory which 
explains (as I think it certainly does) several large classes of 
facts, can be wholly wrong ; notwithstanding the several diffi- 
culties which have to be surmounted somehow, and which 
stagger me even to this day. 

I wish that my health had allowed me to publish in 
e.xtenso ; if ever I get strong enough I will do so, as the 
greater part is written out, and of which MS. the present 
volume is an abstract. 

I fear this note will be almost illegible ; but I am poorly, 
and can hardly sit up. Farewell ; with thanks for your kind 
note, and pleasant remembrances of good old days. 

Yours very sincerely,

My dear Sir, — I have told Murray to send you by post 
(if possible) a copy of my book, and I hope that you will 
receive it at nearly the same time with this note. (N.B. I 
have got a bad finger, which makes me write extra badly.) 
If you are so inclined, I should very much like to hear your 
general impression of the book, as you have thought so pro- 
foundly on the subject, and in so nearly the same channel 
with myself. I hope there will be some little new to you, but 
I fear not much. Remember it is only an abstract, and very 
much condensed. God knows what the public will think. No 
one has read it, except Lyell, with whom I have had much 
correspondence. Hooker thinks him a complete convert, but

he does not seem so in his letters to me ; but is evidently 
deeply interested in the subject I do not think your share 
in the theory will be overlooked by the real judges, as 
Hooker, Lyell, Asa Gray, &c.. I have heard from Mr. Sclater 
that your paper on the Malay Archipelago has been read 
at the Linnean Society, and that he was extremely much 
interested by it 

I have not seen one naturalist for six or nine months, 
owing to the state of my health, and therefore I really have 
no news to tell you. I am writing this at Ilkley Wells, where 
I have been with my family for the last six weeks, and shall 
stay for some few weeks longer. As yet I have profited 
very little. God knows when I shall have strength for my 
bigger book. 

I sincerely hope that you keep your health ; I suppose that 
you will be thinking of returning* soon with your magni- 
ficent collections, and still grander mental materials. You 
will be puzzled how to publish. The Royal Society fund will 
be worth your consideration. With every good wish, pray 
believe me.

you will not at all agree with me. Dr. Hooker, whom I con- 
sider one of the best judges in Europe, is a complete convert,, 
and he thinks Lycll is likewise; certainly, judging from Lyell’s 
letters to me on the subject, he is deeply staggered. Farewell.

C. Darwin to W. B. Carpenter. 

Ilkley, Yorkshire, 

November i8th [1859]. 

My dear Carpenter, — I must thank you for your letter 
on my own account, and, if I know myself, still more warmly 
for the subject’s sake. As you seem to have understood my 
last chapter without reading the previous chapters, you must 
have maturely and most profoundly self-thought out the sub- 
ject; for I have found the most extraordinary difficulty in 
making even able men understand at what I was driving. 
There will be strong opposition to my views. If I am in the 
main right (of course including partial errors unseen by me), 
the admission of my views will depend far more on men, like 
yourself, with well-established reputations, than on my own 
writings. Therefore, on the supposition that when you have 
read my volume you think the view in the main true, I thank 
and honour you for being willing to run the chance of unpopu- 
larity by advocating the view. I know not in the least 
whether any one will review me in any of the Reviews. I do 
not see how an author could enquire or interfere ; but if you 
are willing to review me anywhere, I am sure from the admira- 
tion which I have long felt and expressed for your ‘ Compara-

will do good service in the cause for which I think I am not 
selfishly deeply interested. I am feeling very unwell to-day, 
and this note is badly, perhaps hardly intelligibly, expressed ; 
but you must excuse me, for I could not let a post pass» 
without thanking you for your note. You will have a tough 
job even to shake in the slightest degree Sir H. Holland. I 
do not think (privately I say it) that the great man has know- 
ledge enough to enter on the subject Pray believe me with 
sincerity. 

Yours truly obliged, 

C. Darwin. 

P.S.— As you are not a practical geologist let me add that 
Lyell thinks the chapter on the Imperfection of the Geological 
Record not exaggerated. 



C. Darwin to W. B. Carpenter. 

Ilkley, Yorkshire, 

November 15th [1859]. 

My dear Carpenter, — I beg pardon for troubling you 
again. If, after reading my book, you are able to come to a 
conclusion in any degree definite, will you think me very un- 
reasonable in asking you to let me hear from you. I do not 
ask for a long discussion, but merely for a brief idea of your 
general impression. From your widely extended knowledge, 
habit of investigating the truth, and abilities, I should value 
your opinion in the very highest rank. Though I, of course, 
believe in the truth of my own doctrine, I suspect that no 
bcUef is vivid until shared by others. As yet I know only one 
believer, but I look at him as of the greatest authority, viz. 
Hooker. When I think of the many cases of men who 
have studied one subject for years, and have persuaded

themselves of the truth of the foolishest doctrines, I feel 
sometimes a little frightened, whether I may not be one of 
these monomaniacs. 

Again pray excuse this, I fear, unreasonable request. A 
short note would suffice, and I could bear a hostile verdict, and 
shall have to bear many a one. 

Yours very sincerely, 

C. Darwin.

Ilklcy, Yorkshire, 

Sunday [November, 1859]. 

My dear Hooker, — I have just read a review on my 
book in the Athenceum* and it excites my curiosity much 
who is the author. If you should hear who writes in the 
Athenteum I wish you would tell me. It seems to me well 
done, but the reviewer gives no new objections, and, being 
hostile, passes over every single argument in favour of the 
doctrine, ... I fear from the tone of the review, that I have 
written in a conceited and cocksure style,f which shames 
me a little. There is another review of which I should like 
to know the author, viz. of H. C. Watson in the Gardeners' 
Chronicle. X Some of the remarks are like yours, and he does 
deserve punishment ; but surely the review is too severe. 
Don’t you think so ? . . . . 

I have heard from Carpenter, who, I think, is likely to be a 
convert. Also from Quatrefages, who is inclined to go a 
long way with us. He says that he exhibited in his lecture

I shall stay here one fortnight more, and then go to Down, 
staying on the road at Shrewsbury a week. I have been very 
unfortunate : out of seven weeks I have been confined for five

able to help thinking to a foolish extent about my book. If 
some four or five good men came round nearly to our view, I 
shall not fear ultimate success. I long to learn what Huxley

I hate to hear you abuse your own work. I, on the con- 
trary, so sincerely value all that you have written. It is an old

benefactors of science. Those who merely accumulate facts I

Ever yours, 

C. Darwin. 

P.S. — I feel confident that for the future progress of the 
subject of the origin, and manner of formation of species, the 
assent and arguments and facts of working naturalists, like 
yourself, are far more important than my own book ; so for 
God’s sake do not abuse your Introduction. 

H. C. Watson to C. Darwuu 

Thames Ditton, November 21st [1859]. 

My dear Sir, — Once commenced to read the ‘ Origin,’ I 
could not rest till I had galloped through the whole. I shall 
now begin to re-read it more deliberately. Meantime I am 
tempted to write you the first impressions, not doubting that 
they will, in the main, be the permanent impressions : — 

1st. Your leading idea will assuredly become recognised as 
an established truth in science, ije. “Natural selection.’’ It 
has the characteristics of all great natural truths, clarifying 
what was obscure, simplifying what was intricate, adding 
greatly to previous knowledge. You are the greatest revo- 
lutionist in natural history of this century, if not of all 
centuries. 

2nd. You will perhaps need, in some degree, to limit or 
modify, possibly in some degree also to extend, your present 
applications of the principle of natural selection. Without 
going to matters of more detail, it strikes me that there is 
one considerable primary inconsistency, by one failure in the 
analogy between varieties and species ; another by a sort of 
barrier assumed for nature on insufficient grounds, and arising 
from “divergence” These may, however, be faults in my

1859.] 

own mind, attributable to yet incomplete perception of your 
views. And I had better not trouble you about them before 
again reading the volume. 

3rd. Now these novel views are brought fairly before the 
scientific public, it seems truly remarkable how so many of 
them could have failed to see their right road sooner. How 
could Sir C. Lyell, for instance, for thirty years read, write, 
and think, on the subject of species and their succession, and 
yet constantly look down the wrong road ! 

A quarter of a century ago, you and I must have been in 
something like the same state of mind on the main question. 
But you wore able to see and work out the quo modo of the 
succession, the all-important thing, while I failed to grasp it. 
I send by this post a little controversial pamphlet of old 
date — Combe and Scott. If you will take the trouble to 
glance at the passages scored on the margin, you will see 
that, a quarter of a century ago, I was also one of the few who 
then doubted the absolute distinctness of species, and special 
creations of them. Yet I, like the rest, failed to detect the 
quo modo which was reserved for your penetration to discover, 
and your discernment to apply. 

You answered my query about the hiatus behveen Satyrus 
and Homo as was expected. The obvious explanation really 
never occurred to me till some months after I had read the

7. D. Hooker to C. Darwin. 

Athcnffium, Monday [Nov. 21, 1859]. 

My dear Darwin, — I am a sinner not to have written 
you ere this, if only to thank you for your glorious book — 
what a mass of close reasoning on curious facts and fresh 
phenomena — it is capitally written, and will be very suc- 
cessful. I say this on the strength of two or three plunges 
into as many chapters, for I have not yet attempted to read 
it Lyell, with whom we are staying, is perfectly enchanted, 
and is absolutely gloating over it. I must accept your com- 
pliment to me, and acknowledgment of supposed assistance 
from me, as the warm tribute of affection from an honest 
(though deluded) man, and furthermore accept it as very 
pleasing to my vanity ; but, my dear fellow, neither my name 
nor my judgment nor my assistance deserved any such com- 
pliments, and if I am dishonest enough to be pleased with 
what I don’t deserve, it must just pass. How different the 
book reads from the MS. I see I shall have much to talk 
over with you. Those lazy printers have not finished my 
luckless Essay ; which, beside your book, will look like a 
ragged handkerchief beside a Royal Standard . . . 

All well, ever yours affectionately, 

Jos. D. Hooker.

a little chagrined by the review.* I hope it was not .

As advocate, he might think himself justified in giving the 
aigument only on one side. But the manner in which he 
drags in immortality, and sets the priests at me, and leaves 
me to their mercies, is base. He would, on no account, burn 
me, but he will get the wood ready, and tell the black beasts 
how to catch me. ... It would be unspeakably grand if 
Huxley were to lecture on the subject, but I can see this is a 
mere chance ; Faraday might think it too unorthodox. 

... I had a letter from [Huxley] with such tremendous 
praise of my book, that modesty (as I am trying to cultivate 
that difficult herb) prevents me sending it to you, which 
I should have liked to have done, as he is very modest about 
himself. 

You have cockered me up to that extent, that I now feel I 
can face a score of savage reviewers. I suppose you are still 
with the Lyells. Give my kindest remembrance to them. I 
triumph to hear that he continues to approve. 

Believe me, your would-be modest friend,

C. Darwin to C. Lyell. 

Ilkley Wells, Yorkshire, 

November 23rd [1859]. 

My dear Lyell, — You seemed to have worked admirably 
on the species question ; there could not have been a better 
plan than reading up on the opposite side. I rejoice pro- 
foundly that you intend admitting the doctrine of modifica- 
tion in your new edition ;* nothing, I am convinced, could be 
more important for its success. I honour you most sincerely. 
To have maintained in the position of a master, one side of a 
question for thirty years, and then deliberately give it up, is a 

* It appears from Sir Charles lisbed till 1865. He was, however, 
Lyell’s published letters that he in- at work on the ‘ Antiquity of Man’ 
tended to admit the doctrine of in i860, and had already deter- 
evolution in a new edition of the mined to discuss the ‘Origin’ at 
‘ Manual,’ but this was not pub- the end of the book.

fact to which I much doubt whether the records of science offer 
a parallel. For myself, also, I rejoice profoundly ; for, thinking 
of so many cases of men pursuing an illusion for years, often 
and often a cold shudder has run through me, and I have 
asked myself whether I may not have devoted my life to a 
phantasy. Now I look at it as morally impossible that in- 
vestigators of truth, like you and Hooker, can be wholly 
wrong, and therefore I rest in peace. Thank you for criti- 
cisms, which, if there be a second edition, I will attend to. 
I have been thinking that if I am much execrated as an 
atheist, &c., whether the admission of the doctrine of natural 
selection could injure your works ; but I hope and think not, 
for, as far as I can remember, the virulence of bigotry is 
expended on the first offender, and those who adopt his views 
are only pitied as deluded, by the wise and cheerful bigots. 

1 cannot help thinking that you overrate the importance of 
the multiple origin of dogs. The only difference is, that in the 
case of single origins, all difference of the races has originated 
since man domesticated the species. In the case of multiple 
origins, part of the difference was produced under natural con- 
ditions. I should infinitely prefer the theory of single origin 
in all cases, if facts would permit its reception. But there 
seems to me some a priori improbability (seeing how fond 
savages are of taming animals), that throughout all times, and 
throughout all the world, man should have domesticated one 
single species alone, of the widely distributed genus Canis. 
Besides this, the close resemblance of at least three kinds of 
American domestic dogs to wild species still inhabiting the 
countries where they are now domesticated, seems to almost 
compel admission that more than one wild Canis has been 
domesticated by man. 

I thank you cordially for all the generous zeal and interest 
you have shown about my book, and I remain, my dear Lyell, 
Your affectionate friend and disciple, 

Charles Darwin.

November 23rd, 1859. 

My dear Darwin, — I finished your book yesterday, a 
lucky examination having furnished me with a few hours of 
continuous leisure. 

Since I read Von Bar’s * essays, nine years ago, no work on 
Natural History Science I have met with has made so great 
an impression upon me, and I do most heartily thank you for 
the great store of new views you have given me. Nothing, I 
think, can be better than the tone of the book, it impresses 
those who know nothing about the subject As for your 
■doctrine, I am prepared to go to the stake, if requisite, in sup- 
port of Chapter IX., and most parts of Chapters X., XI., XII., 
and Chapter XIII. contains much that is most admirable, 
but on one or two points I enter a caveat until I can see 
further into all sides of the question. 

As to the first four chapters, I agree thoroughly and fully 
with all the principles laid down in them. I think you have 
demonstrated a true cause for the production of species, and 
have thrown the onus probandi, that species did not arise in 
the way -you suppose, on your adversaries. 

But I feel that I have not yet by any means fully 
realized the bearings of those most remarkable and original

Chapters III., IV. and V., and I will write no more about 
them just now. 

The only objections that have occurred to me are, ist that 
you have loaded yourself with an unnecessary difficulty in 
adopting Natura non facit saltuvi so unreservedly. . . . And 
2nd, it is not clear to me why, if continual physical conditions 
are of so little moment as you suppose, variation should 
occur at all. 

However, I must read the book two or three times more 
before I presume to begin picking holes. 

I trust you will not allow yourself to be in any way dis- 
gusted or annoyed by the considerable abuse and mis- 
representation which, unless I greatly mistake, is in store for 
you. Depend upon it you have earned the lasting gratitude 
of all thoughtful men. And as to the curs which will bark 
and yelp, you must recollect that some of your friends, at 
any rate, are endowed with an amount of combativeness 
which (though you have often and justly rebuked it) may 
stand you in good stead. 

I am sharpening up my claws and beak in readiness. 

Looking back over my letter, it really expresses so feebly 
all I think about you and your noble book that I am half 
ashamed of it ; but you will understand that, like the parrot 
in the story, “ I think the more.” 

Ever yours faithfully,

My dear Huxley, — Your letter has been forwarded to

extreme unction, I can now sing “ nunc dimittis.” I should 
have been more than contented with one quarter of what you 
have said. Exactly fifteen months ago, when I put pen to

paper for this volume, I had awful misgivings ; and thought 
perhaps I had deluded myself, like so many have done, 
and I then fixed in my mind three judges, on whose decision 
I determined mentally to abide. The judges were Lyell, 
Hooker, and yourself. It was this which made me so exces- 
sively anxious for your verdict. I am now contented, and 
can sing my " nunc dimittis.” What a joke it would be if I 
pat you on the back when you attack some immovable crea- 
tionists ! You have most cleverly hit on one point, which has 
greatly troubled me ; if, as I must think, external conditions 
produce little direct effect, what the devil determines each 
particular variation? What makes a tuft of feathers come 
on a cock’s head, or moss on a moss-rose ? I shall much like 
to talk over this with you. . . . 

My dear Huxley, I thank you cordially for your letter.

Dear Charles, — I am so much weaker in the head, that 
I hardly know if I can write, but at all events I will jot down 
a few things that the Dr.* has said. He has not read much 
above half, so as he says he can give no definite conclusion, 
and it is my private belief he wishes to remain in that state. 
... He is evidently in a dreadful state of indecision, and 
keeps stating that he is not tied down to either view, and that 
he has always left an escape by the way he has spoken of

varieties. I happened to speak of the eye before he had read 
that part, and it took away his breath — utterly impossible — 
structure — function, &c., &c.. See., but when he had read it he 
hummed and hawed, and perhaps it was partly conceivable, 
and then he fell back on the bones of the ear, which were 
beyond all probability or conceivability. He mentioned a 
slight blot, which I also observed, that in speaking of the 
slave-ants carrying one another, you change the species 
without giving notice first, and it makes one turn back. . . . 

. . . For myself I really think it is the most interesting 
book I ever read, and can only compare it to the first know- 
ledge of chemistry, getting into a new world or rather behind 
the scenes. To me the geographical distribution, I mean the 
relation of islands to continents is the most convincing of the 
proofs, and the relation of the oldest forms to the existing 
species. I dare say I don’t feel enough the absence of 
varieties, but then I don’t in the least know if everything 
now living were fossilized whether the palaeontologists could 
distinguish them. In fact the d priori reasoning is so entirely 
satisfactory to me that if the facts won’t fit in, why so much 
the worse for the facts is my feeling. My ague has left me 
in such a state of torpidity that I wish I had gone through 
the process of natural selection.

not attempt much. Will you send me one line to say whether

Madame Belloc wants to translate my book into French ; 
I have offered to look over proofs for scientific errors. Did 
you ever hear of her ? I believe Murray has agreed at my 
urgent advice, but I fear I have been rash and premature. 
Quatrefages has written to me, saying he agrees largely with 
my views. He is an excellent naturalist. I am pressed for 
time. Will you give us one line about the whales ? Again 
I thank you for never-tiring advice and assistance ; I do in

[With regard to a French translation, he wrote to Mr.

my book translated ; and indirectly its being known abroad 
will do good to the English sale. If it depended on me, 
I shouid agree without payment, and instantly send a copy, 
and only beg that she [Mme. Belloc] would get some scientific 
man to look over the translation. . . . You might say that, 
though I am a very poor French scholar, I could detect any

plan fell through in the following year. He wrote to M. de

‘ Origin of Species ’ has failed in getting a publisher.

It was foolish and presumptuous in me, hoping to appear in a

had it not been suggested to me. It is a great loss. I must 
console myself with the German edition which Prof. Bronn is 
bringing out” * 

A sentence in another letter to M. de Quatrefages shows 
how anxious he was to convert one of the greatest of contemp- 
orary Zoologists : “ How I should like to know whether 
Milne-Edwards has read the copy which I sent him, and 
whether he thinks I have made a pretty good case on our 
side of the question. There is no naturalist in the world 
for whose opinion I have so profound a respect. Of course I 
am not so silly as to expect to change his opinion.”]

The edition was 1250 copies. When I was in spirits, I 
sometimes fancied that my book would be successful, but I 
never even built a castle in the air of such success as it has 
met with ; I do not mean the sale, but the impression it has 
made on you (whom I have always looked at as chief judge)

my wildest hopes.

C. Darwin to C. Lyell. 

Ilkley, Yorkshire, 
December 2nd [1859]. 

My dear Lyell, — Every note which you have sent me has 
interested me much. Pray thank Lady Lyell for her remark.. 
In the chapters she refers to, I was unable to modify the pas- 
sage in accordance to your suggestion ; but in the final 
chapter I have modified three or four. Kingsley, in a note • 
to me, had a capital paragraph on such notions as mine being 
not opposed to a high conception of the Deity. I have inserted 
it as an extract from a letter to me from a celebrated author 
and divine. I have put in about nascent organs. I had the 
greatest difficulty in partially making out Sedgwick’s letter, and 
I dare say I did greatly underrate its clearness. Do what I 
could, I fear I shall be greatly abused. In answer to Sedg- 
wick’s remark that my book would be “ mischievous," I asked 
him whether truth can be known except by being victorious 
over all attacks. But it is no use. H. C. Watson tells me 
that one zoologist says he will read my book, “ but I will never 
believe it." What a spirit to read any book in ! Crawford 
writes to me that his notice t will be hostile, but that ‘‘ he will 
not calumniate the author.” He says he has read my book, 
“ at least such parts as he could understand.” He sent me 
some notes and suggestions (quite unimportant), and they 
show me that I have unavoidably done harm to the subject, 
by publishing an abstract. He is a real Pallasian ; nearly all 
our domestic races descended from a multitude of wild species 
now commingled. I expected Murchison to be outrageous.

of denudation ! How singular so great a geologist should 
have so unphilosophical a mind ! I have had several notes 

from , very civil and less decided. Says he shall not 

pronounce against me without much reflection, perhaps will

of my life to your generous support, and that of a very few 
others. I do not think I am brave enough to have stood 
being odious without support ; now I feel as bold as a lion. 
But there‘[is one thing I can see I must learn, viz. to think 
less of myself and my book. Farewell, with cordial thanks. 
Yours most truly,

[In December there appeared in ‘ Macmillan’s Magazine ’ 
an article, “Time and Life,” by Professor Huxley. It is 
mainly occupied by an analysis of the argument of the 
‘ Origin,’ but it also gives the substance of a lecture deliver- 
ed at the Royal Institution before that book was published. 
Professor Huxley spoke strongly in favour of evolution in his 
Lecture, and explains that in so doing he was to a great 
extent resting on a knowledge of “ the general tenor of the 
researches in which Mr. Darwin had been so long engaged,” 
and was supported in so doing by his perfect confidence in 
his knowledge, perseverance, and “ high-minded love of 
truth.” He was evidently deeply pleased by Mr. Huxley’s 
words, and wrote :

book in ‘ Macmillan.’ No one could receive a more delightful

much to me from our mutual friendship. You have explained 
my leading idea with admirable clearness. What a gift you 
have of writing (or more properly thinking) clearly.”] 



C. Darwin to W. B. Carpenter. 

Illdey, Yorkshire, 

December 3rd [1859]. 

My dear Carpenter,— I am perfectly delighted at your 
letter. It is a great thing to have got a great physiologist on. 
our side. I say “our” for we are now a good and compact 
body of really good men, and mostly not old men. In the 
long-run we shall conquer. I do not like being abused, but I 
feel that I can now bear it ; and, as I told Lyell, I am well 
convinced that it is the first offender who reaps the rich 
harvest of abuse. You have done an essential kindness in 
checking the odium theologicum in the [?].* It much pains 
ail one’s female relations and injures the cause. 

I look at it as immaterial whether we go quite the same 
lengths ; and I suspect. Judging from myself, that you will go 
further, by thinking of a population of forms like Ornitho- 
rhynchus, and by thinking of the common homological and 
cmbryological structure of the several vertebrate orders. But 
this is immaterial. I quite agree that the principle is every- 
thing. In my fuller MS. I have discussed a good many 
instincts ; but there will surely be more unfilled gaps here 
than with corporeal structure, for we have no fossil instincts, 
and know scarcely any except of European animals. When 
I reflect how very slowly I came round myself, I am in truth 
astonished at the candour shown by Lyell, Hooker, Huxley, 

• This must refer to Carpenter’s number of the ‘ National Review,’ 
critique, which would now have i860, and in which the odium theo~ 
been ready to appear in the January logicum is referred to.

dially for taking the trouble of writing a review for the 
‘National.’ God knows I shall have few enough in any 
degree favourable.*

Saturday [December 5th, 1859]. 

... I have had a letter from Carpenter this morning. He 
reviews me in the ‘ National.’ He is a convert, but does not 
go quite so far as I, but quite far enough, for he admits that 
all birds are from one progenitor, and probably all fishes and 
reptiles from another parent But the last mouthful chokes 
him. He can hardly admit all vertebrates from one parent. 
He will surely come to this from Homology and Embryology. 
I look at it as grand having brought round a great physio- 
logist, for great I think he certainly is in that line. How 
curious I shall be to know what line Owen will take: dead 
against us, I fear ; but he wrote me a most liberal note on the 
reception of my book, and said he was quite prepared to 
consider fairly and without prejudice my line of argument.

nearly all points, than that I should toss up a penny and get 
heads twenty times running. I asked him what he thought 
the weakest part He said he had no particular objection to 
any part He added : — 

“ If I must criticise, I should say, we do not want to know 
what Darwin believes and is convinced of, but what he can 
prove.” I agreed most fully and truly that I have probably 
greatly sinned in this line, and defended my general line of 
argument of Inventing a theory and seeing how many classes 
of facts the theory would explain. I added that I would en- 
deavour to modify the “ believes ” and “ convinceds.” He took 
me up short : "You will then spoil your book, the charm of (I) 
it is that it is Darwin himself." He added another objec- 
tion, that the book was too teres atque rotundus — that it ex- 
plained everything, and that it was improbable in the highest 
degree that I should succeed in this. I quite agree with this 
rather queer objection, and it comes to this that my book 
must be very bad or very good. . . . 

I have heard, by a roundabout channel, that Herschel says 
my book " is the law of higgledy-piggledy.” What this

J. D. Hooker to C. Darwin. 

Kew [1859]. 

Dear Darwin, — ^You have, I know, been drenched with 
letters since the publication of your book, and I have hence 
forborne to add my mite.* I hope now that you are well 
through Edition II., and I have heard that you were 
flourishing in London. I have not yet got half-through the 
book, not from want of will, but of time — for it is the very 
hardest book to read, to full profits, that I ever tried — it is so 
cram-full of matter and reasoning. I am all the more glad 
that you have published in this form, for the three volumes, 
unprefaced by this, would have choked any Naturalist of the 
nineteenth century, and certainly have softened my brain in 
the operation of assimilating their contents. I am perfectly 
tired of marvelling at the wonderful amount of facts you have 
brought to bear, and your skill in marshalling them and 
throwing them on the enemy ; it is also extremely clear as 
far as I have gone, but very hard to fully appreciate. Some- 
how it reads very different from the MS., and I often fancy that 
I must have been very stupid not to have more fully followed 
it in MS. Lyell told me of his criticisms. I did not appre- 
ciate them all, and there are many little matters I hope one 
day to talk over with you. I saw a highly flattering notice

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, December 14th [1859]. 

My dear Hooker, — Your approval of my book, for many 
reasons, gives me intense satisfaction ; but I must make some 
allowance for your kindness and sympathy. Any one with 
ordinary faculties, if he had patience enough and plenty of 
time, could have written my book. You do not know how I 
admire your and Lyell’s generous and unselfish sympathy ; I 
do not believe either of you would have cared so much about 
your own work. My book, as yet, has been far more suc- 
cessful than I ever even formerly ventured in the wildest day- 
dreams to anticipate. We shall soon be a good body of 
working men, and shall have, I am convinced, all young and 
rising naturalists on our side. I shall be intensely interested 
to hear whether my book produces any effect on A. Gray ; 
from what I heard at Lyell’s, I fancy your correspondence has 
brought him some way already. I fear that there is no 
chance of Bentham being staggered. Will he read my book ? 
Has he a copy ? I would send him one of the reprints if he 
has not. Old J. E. Gray,* at the British Museum, attacked 
me in fine style: “You have just reproduced Lamarck’s doc- 



• John Edward Gray (bom 1800,

Natural Arrangement of British 
Plants,’ one of the earliest works in 
English on the natural method. In

attacking him for twenty years, and because j/w (with a sneer 
and laugh) say the very same thing, they are all coming 
round ; it is the most ridiculous inconsistency, &c. &c.” 

You must be very glad to be settled in your house, and I 
hope all the improvements satisfy you. As far as my expe- 
rience goes, improvements are never perfection. I am very 
sorry to hear that you are still so very busy, and have so much 
work. And now for the main purport of my note, which is to 
ask and beg you and Mrs. Hooker (whom it is really an age 
since I have seen), and all your children, if you like, to come 
and spend a week here. It would be a great pleasure to me 
and to my wife. ... As far as we can see, we shall be at 
home all the winter ; and all times probably would be equally 
convenient ; but if you can, do not put it off very late, as it 
may slip through. Think of this and persuade Mrs. Hooker, 
and be a good man and come 

Farewell, my kind and dear friend. 

Yours affectionately, 

C. Darwin. 

P.S. — I shall be very curious to hear what you think of my 
discussion on Classification in Chap. Xlll. ; I believe Huxley 
demurs to the whole, and says he has nailed his colours to 
the mast, and I would sooner die than give up ; so that 
we are in as fine a frame of mind to discuss the point as any 
two religionists. 

Embryology is my pet bit in my book, and, confound my 
friends, not one has noticed this to me.

to-day’s note is merely personal. I should, for several reasons, 
be very glad of an American Edition. I have made up my 
mind to be well abused ; but I think it of importance that my 
notions should be read by intelligent men, accustomed to 
scientific argument, though not naturalists. It may seem 
absurd, but I think such men will drag after them those 
naturalists who have too firmly fixed in their heads that a 
species is an entity. The first edition of 1250 copies was sold 
on the first day, and now my publisher is printing off, as 
rapidly as possible, 3000 more copies. I mention this solely 
because it renders probable a remunerative sale in America. 
I should be infinitely obliged if you could aid an American 
reprint ; and could make, for my sake and the publisher’s, any 
arrangement for any profit The new edition is only a reprint, 
yet I have made a few important corrections. I will have 
the clean sheets sent over in a few days of as many sheets as 
are printed off, and the remainder afterwards, and you can do 
anything you like, — if nothing, there is no harm done. I 
should be glad for the new edition to be reprinted and not the 
old. — In great haste, and with hearty thanks. 

Yours very sincerely, 

C. Darwin.

me grand, especially the generalization about the Australian 
flora itself. How superior to Robert Brown’s celebrated 
essay! I have not seen Naudin’s paper,* and shall not be 
able till I hunt the libraries. I am very anxious to see it 
Decaisne seems to think he gives my whole theory. I do 
not know when I shall have time and strength to grapple 
with Hooker. . . . 

P.S.— I have heard from Sir W. Jardinc :t his criticisms are 
quite unimportant ; some of the Galapagos so-called species 
ought to be called varieties, which I fully expected ; some of 
the sub-genera, thought to be wholly endemic, have been found 
on the Continent (not that he gives his authority), but I do 
not make out that the species are the same. His letter is 
brief and vague, but he says he will write again.

how big it is : I shall not be able to read it very soon. It 
was very good of you to send Naudin, for I was very curious 
to see it I am surprised that Decaisne should say it was 
the same as mine. Naudin gives artificial selection, as well 
as a score of English writers, and when he says species were 
formed in the same manner, I thought the paper would cer- 
tainly prove exactly the same as mine. But I cannot find 
one word like the struggle for existence and natural selection. 
On the contrary, he brings in his principle (p. 103) of finality 
(which I do not understand), which, he says, with some authors 
is fatality, with others providence, and which adapts the forms 
of every being, and harmonises them all throughout nature. 

He assumes like old geologists (who assumed that the forces 
of nature were formerly greater), that species were at first 
more plastic. His simile of tree and classification is like 
mine (and others), but he cannot, I think, have reflected 
much on the subject, otherwise he would see that genealogy 
by itself does not give classification ; I declare I cannot see a 
much closer approach to Wallace and me in Naudin than 
in Lamarck — ^we all agree in modification and descent. If 
I do not hear from you I will return the ‘ Revue ’ in a few 
days (with the cover). I dare say Lyell would be glad to see 
it. By the way, I will retain the volume till I hear whether 
I shall or not send it to Lyell. I should rather like Lyell 
to see this note, though it is foolish work sticking up for 
independence or priority. 

Ever yours,

of last week ; but it may have come a few days sooner, and 
been overlooked among my book-parcels, which often remain 
unopened when I am lazy or busy with any work before me. 
So soon as I opened it I began to read it, and I finished it, 
after many interruptions, on Tuesday. Yesterday I was em- 
ployed — 1st, in preparing for my lecture ; 2ndly, in attending 
a meeting of my brother Fellows to discuss the final proposi- 
tions of the Parliamentary Commissioners ; srdly, in lecturing ; 
4thly, in hearing the conclusion of the discussion and the 
College reply, whereby, in conformity with my own wishes, we 
accepted the scheme of the Commissioners ; 5thly, in dining 
with an old friend at Clare College ; 6thly, in adjourning to 
the weekly meeting of the Ray Club, from which I returned 
at 10 P.M., dog-tired, and hardly able to climb my staircase. 
Lastly, in looking through the Times to see what was going 
on in the busy world. 

I do not state this to fill space (though I believe that 
Nature does abhor a vacuum), but to prove that my reply and 
my thanks are sent to you by the earliest leisure I have, though 
that is but a very contracted opportunity. If I did not think 
you a good-tempered and truth-loving man, I should not tell 
you that (spite of the great knowledge, store of facts, capital 
views of the correlation of the various parts of organic nature, 
admirable hints about the diffusion, through wide regions, of 
many related organic beings, &c. &c.) I have read your book 
with more pain than pleasure. Parts of it I admired greatly, 
parts I laughed at till my sides were almost sore ; other parts 
I read with absolute sorrow, because I think them utterly 
false and grievously mischievous. You have deserted — after 
a start in that tram-road of all solid physical truth — the true 
method of induction, and started us in machinery as wild, 
I think, as Bishop Wilkins’s locomotive that was to sail with 
us to the moon. Many of your wide conclusions are based 
upon assumptions which can neither be proved nor disproved, 
why then express them in the language and arrangement

of philosophical induction ? As to your grand principle — 
natural selection — what is it but a secondary consequence of 
supposed, or known, primary facts ? Development is a better 
word, because more close to the cause of the fact ? For you 
do not deny causation. I call (in the abstract) causation the 
will of God ; and I can prove that He acts for the good of 
His creatures. He also acts by laws which we can study 
and comprehend. Acting by law, and under what is called 
final causes, comprehends, I think, your whole principle. 
You write of “ natural selection ” as if it were done consciously 
by the selecting agent ’Tis but a consequence of the pre- 
supposed development, and the subsequent battle for life. 
This view of nature you have stated admirably, though 
admitted by all naturalists and denied by no one of common 
sense. We all admit development as a fact of history : but 
how came it about ? Here, in language, and still more in 
logic, we are point-blank at issue. There is a moral or meta- 
physical part of nature as well as a physical. A man who 
denies this is deep in the mire of folly. ’Tis the crown and 
glory of organic science that it does through final cause, link 
material and moral ; and yet does not allow us to mingle 
them in our first conception of laws, and our classification 
of such laws, whether we consider one side of nature or the 
other. You have ignored this link ; and, if I do not mistake 
your meaning, you have done your best in one or two preg- 
nant cases to break it. Were it possible (which, thank God, it is 
not) to break it, humanity, in my mind, would suffer a damage 
that might brutalize it, and sink the human race into a lower 
grade of degradation than any into which it has fallen since 
its written records tell us of its history. Take the case of the 
bee-cells. If your development produced the successive 
modification of the bee and its cells (which no mortal can 
prove), final cause would stand good as the directing cause 
under which the successive generations acted and gradually 
improved. Passages in your book, like that to which I have

alluded (and there are others almost as bad), greatly shocked 
my moral taste. I think, in speculating on organic descent, 
you over-stsX^ the evidence of geology ; and that you under- 
state it while you are talking of the broken links of your 
natural pedigree : but my paper is nearly done, and I must 
go to my lecture-room. Lastly, then, I greatly dislike the con- 
cluding chapter— not as a summary, for in that light it appears 
good — but I dislike it from the tone of triumphant confidence 
in which you appeal to the rising generation (in a tone I con- 
demned in the author of the ‘ Vestiges ’) and prophecy of things 
not yet in the womb of time, nor (if we are to trust the accumu- 
lated experience of human sense and the inferences of its 
logic) ever likely to be found anywhere but in the fertile womb 
of man’s imagination. And now to say a word about a son of 
a monkey and an old friend of yours : I am better, far better, 
than I was last year. I have been lecturing three days 
a week (formerly I gave six a week) without much fatigue, 
but I find by the loss of activity and memory, and of all pro- 
ductive powers, that my bodily frame is sinking slowly towards 
the earth. But I have visions of the future. They are as 
much a part of myself as my stomach and my heart, and these 
visions are to have their antitype in solid fruition of what is 
best and greatest. But on one condition only — that I humbly 
accept God’s revelation of Himself both in His works and in 
His word, and do my best to act in conformity with that 
knowledge which He only can give me, and He only can 
sustain me in doing. If you and 1 do all this, we shall meet 
in heaven. 

I have written in a hurry, and in a spirit of brotherly love,, 
therefore forgive any sentence you happen to dislike; and 
believe me, spite of any disagreement in some points of the 
deepest moral interest, your true-hearted old friend,

C. Darwin to T. H. Huxley. 

Down, Dec. 25th [1859]. 

My dear Huxley, — One part of your note has pleased 
me so much that I must thank you for it Not only Sir 
H. H. [Holland], but several others, have attacked me about 
analogy leading to belief in one primordial created form.* 
(By which I mean only that we know nothing as yet [of] how 
life originates.) I thought I was universally condemned on 
this head. But I answered that though perhaps it would 
have been more prudent not to have put it in, I would not 
strike it out, as it seemed to me probable, and I give it on 
no other grounds. You will see in your mind the kind of 
arguments which made me think it probable, and no one 
fact had so great an effect on me as your most curious remarks 
on the apparent homologies of the head of Vertebrata and 
Articulata. 

You have done a real good turn in the Agency business t 
(I never before heard of a hard-working, unpaid agent besides 
yourself), in talking with Sir H. H., for he will have great 
influence over many. He floored me from my ignorance 
about the bones of the ear, and I made a mental note to ask 
you what the facts were. 

With hearty thanks and real admiration for your generous 
zeal for the subject. 

Yours most truly,

a strong feeling that no one had better defend his own 
priority. I cannot say that I am as indifferent to the subject 
as I ought to be, but one can avoid doing anything in 
consequence. 

I do not believe one iota about your having assimilated any 
of my notions unconsciously. You have always done me more 
than justice. But I do think I did you a bad turn by getting 
you to read the old MS., as it must have checked your own 
original thoughts. There is one thing I am fully convinced 
of, that the future progress (which is the really important 
point) of the subject will have depended on really good and 
w'ell-known workers, like yourself, Lyell, and Huxley, having 
taken up the subject, than on my own work. I see plainly it 
is this that strikes my non-scientific friends.

THE ‘TIMES’ REVIEW. 



253 



C. Darwin to T. H. Huxley. 



Down, Dec. 28th [1859]. 

My dear Huxley, — Yesterday evening, when I read the 
Times of a previous day, I was amazed to find a splendid 
essay and review of me. Who can the author be? I am 
intensely curious. It included an eulogium of me which quite 
touched me, though I am not vain enough to think it all 
deserved. The author is a literary man, and German scholar. 
He has read my book very attentively ; but, what is very 
remarkable, it seems that he is a profound naturalist. He 
knows my Barnacle-book, and appreciates it too highly. 
Lastly, he writes and thinks with quite uncommon force and 
clearness ; and what is even still rarer, his writing is seasoned 
with most pleasant wit We all laughed heartily over some 
of the sentences. I was charmed with those unreasonable 
mortals, who know anything, all thinking fit to range them- 
selves on one side.* Who can it be? Certainly I should 
have said that there was only one man in England who could 
have written this essay, and that you were the man. But I 
suppose I am wrong, and that there is some hidden genius of 
great calibre. For how could you influence Jupiter Olympius 
and make him give three and a half columns to pure science ? 
The old fogies will think the world will come to an end. 
Well, whoever the man is, he has done great service to the 
cause, far more than by a dozen reviews in common peri- 
odicals. The grand way he soars above common religious 



• The reviewer proposes to pass 
by the orthodox view, according to 
which the phenomena of the organic 
world are “ the immediate product 
of a creative fiat, and consequently 
are out of the domain of science 
altogether." And he does so “ with 
less hesitation, as it so happens 
that those persons who arc prac- 



tically conversant with the facts of 
the case (plainly a considerable 
advantage) have always thought 
fit to range themselves” in the 
category of those holding “views 
which profess to rest on a scientific 
basis only, and therefore admit 
of being argued to their conse- 
quences.”

prejudices, and the admission of such views into the Times, 
I look at as of the highest importance, quite independently of 
the mere question of species. If you should happen to be 
acquainted with the author, for Heaven-sake tell me who 
he is? 

My dear Huxley, yours most sincerely, 

C. Darwin. 

[It is impossible to give in a short space an adequate idea 
of Mr. Huxley’s article in the Times of December 26. It is 
admirably planned, so as to claim for the ‘ Origin ’ a respectful 
hearing, and it abstains from anything like dogmatism in 
asserting the truth of the doctrines therein upheld. A few pas- 
sages may be quoted : — “ That this most ingenious hypothesis 
enables us to give a reason for many apparent anomalies in the 
distribution of living beings in time and space, and that it is not 
contradicted by the main phenomena of life and organisation, 
appear to us to be unquestionable.” Mr. Huxley goes on to 
recommend to the readers of the ‘ Origin ’ a condition of 
"thdtige Skepsis " — a state of “doubt which so loves truth 
that it neither dares rest in doubting, nor extinguish itself 
by unjustified belief.” The final paragraph is in a strong 
contrast to Professor Sedgwick and his “ ropes of bubbles ” 
(see p. 298). Mr. Huxley writes : “ Mr. Darwin abhors mere 
speculation as nature abhors a vacuum. He is as greedy of 
cases and precedents as any constitutional lawyer, and all the 
principles he lays down are capable of being brought to the 
test of observation and experiment. The path he bids us 
follow professes to be not a mere airy track, fabricated of 
ideal cobwebs, but a solid and broad bridge of facts. If it be 
so, it will carry us safely over many a chasm in our know- 
ledge, and lead us to a region free from the snares of those 
fascinating but barren virgins, the Final Causes, against whom 
a high authority has so justly warned us.” 

There can be no doubt that this powerful essay, appearing

•as it did in the leading daily Journal, must have had a strong 
influence on the reading public. Mr. Huxley allows me to 
quote from a letter an account of the happy chance that threw 
into his hands the opportunity of writing it. 

“ The ‘ Origin ’ was sent to Mr. Lucas, one of the staff of 
the Times writers at that day, in what I suppose was the 
ordinary course of business. Mr. Lucas, though an excellent 
journalist, and, at a later period, editor of ‘ Once a Week,’ 
was as innocent of any knowledge of science as a babe, and 
bewailed himself to an acquaintance on having to deal with 
such a book. Whereupon he was recommended to ask me to 
get him out of his difficulty, and he applied to me accordingly, 
explaining, however, that it would be necessary for him 
formally to adopt anything 'I might be disposed to write, by 
prefacing it with two or three paragraphs of his own. 

“ I was too anxious to seize upon the opportunity thus 
offered of giving the book a fair chance with the multitudinous 
readers of the Times to make any difficulty about condi- 
tions ; and being then very full of the subject, I wrote the 
article faster, I think, than I ever wrote anything in my life, 
and sent it to Mr. Lucas, who duly prefixed his opening 
sentences. 

" When the article appeared, there was much speculation as 
to its authorship. The secret leaked out in time, as all secrets 
will, but not by my aid ; and then I used to derive a good 
deal of innocent amusement from the vehement assertions of 
Some of my more acute friends, that they knew it was mine 
from the first paragraph I 

“As the Times some years since, referred to my connection 
with the review, I suppose there will be no breach of con- 
fidence in the publication of this little history, if you think it 
worth the space it will occupy.”]

C. Danvin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, January 3rd [i860]. 

My dear Hooker,— I have finished your Essay.* As 
probably you would like to hear my opinion, though a non- 
botanist, I will give it without any exaggeration. To my 
judgment it is by far the grandest and most interesting essay, 
on subjects of the nature discussed, I have ever read. You 
know how I admired your former essays, but this seems to 
me far grander. I like all the part after p. xxvi better than 
the first part, probably because newer to me. I dare say you 
will demur to this, for I think every author likes the most 
speculative parts of his own productions. How superior your 
essay is to the famous one of Brown (here will be sneer 1st 
from you). You have made all your conclusions so admirably 
clear, that it would be no use at all to be a botanist (sneer 
No. 2). By Jove, it would do harm to affix any idea to the 
long names of outlandish orders. One can look at your con- 
clusions with the philosophic abstraction with which a mathe- 
matician looks a.thh a X x + &c. &c. I hardly know 

which parts have interested me most ; for over and over again 
I exclaimed, “ this beats all.” The general comparison of the 
Flora of Australia with the rest of the world, strikes me (as 
before) as extremely original, good, and suggestive of many 
reflections. 

.... The invading Indian Flora is very interesting, but I 
think the fact you mention towards the close of the essay — 
that the Indian vegetation, in contradistinction to the Ma-

conquering those of lesser ; of course the Indian forms would 
have a greater difficulty in seizing on the cool parts of Aus- 
tralia. I demur to your remarks (page 1), as not “ conceiving 
anything in soil, climate, or vegetation of India," which could 
stop the introduction of Australian plants. Towards the close 
of the essay (page civ), you have admirable remarks on our 
profound ignorance of the cause of possible naturalisation 
or introduction ; I would answer p. 1, by a later page, viz. 
p. civ. 

Your contrast of the south-west and south-east corners is 
one of the most wonderful cases I ever heard of. . . . You 
show the case with wonderful force. Your discussion on 
mixed invaders of the south-east eomer (and of New Zealand) 
is as curious and intricate a problem as of the races of men in 
Britain. Your remark on a mixed invading Flora keeping 
down or destroying an original Flora, which was richer in 
number of species, strikes me as eminently new and important. 
I am not sure whether to me the discussion on the New Zea- 
land Flora is not even more instructive. I cannot too much 
admire both. But it will require a long time to suck in all 
the facts. Your case of the largest Australian orders having 
none, or very few, species in New Zealand, is truly mar- 
vellous. Anyhow, you have now demonstrated (together 
with no mammals in New Zealand) (bitter sneer No. 3), that 
New Zealand has never been continuously, or even nearly 
eontinuously, united by land to Australia 1 ! At p. Lxxxi.x, 
is the only sentence (on this subject) in the whole essay at 
which I am much inclined to quarrel, viz. that no theory 
of trans-oceanic migration ean explain, &c. &c. Now I 
maintain against all the world, that no man knows anything 
about the trans-oceanic power of migration. You do not 
know whether or not the absent orders have seeds which 
arc killed by sea-water, like almost all Leguminosae, and 
like another order which I forget. Birds do not migrate

from Australia to New Zealand, and therefore floatation seems 
the only possible means ; but yet I maintain that we do not 
know enough to argue on the question, especially as we do 
not know the main fact whether the seeds of Australian 
orders are killed by sea- water. 

The discussion on European Genera is profoundly interest- 
ing ; but here alone I earnestly beg for more information, viz. 
to know which of these genera are absent in the Tropics of 
the world, confined to temperate regions. I excessively 
wish to know, on the notion of Glacial Migration, how much 
modification has taken place in Australia. I had better 
explain when we meet, and get you to go over and mark 
the list. 

.... The list of naturalised plants is extremely interest- 
ing, but why at the end, in the name of all that is good and 
bad, do you not sum up and comment on your facts } Come, I 
will have a sneer at you in return for the many which you will 
have launched at this letter. Should you [not] have remarked 
on the number of plants naturalised in Australia and the 
United States under extremely different climates, as showing 
that climate is so important, and [on] the considerable 
sprinkling of plants from India, North America, and South 
Africa, as showing that the frequent introduction of seeds is 
so important ? With respect to “ abundance of unoccupied 
ground in Australia,” do you believe that European plants 
introduced by man now grow on spots in Australia which 
were absolutely bare ? But I am an impudent dog, one must 
defend one's own fancy theories against such cruel men as 
you. I dare say this letter will appear very conceited, but 
one must form an opinion on what one reads with attention, 
and in simple truth, I cannot find words strong enough to 
express my admiration of your essay. 

My dear old friend, yours affectionately, 

C. Darwin.

P.S. — I differ about the Saturday Reviexv.* One cannot 
expect fairness in a reviewer, so I do not complain of all 
the other arguments besides the ‘Geological Record’ being 
omitted. Some of the remarks about the lapse of years are 
very good, and the reviewer gives me some good and well- 
deserved raps — confound it. I am sorry to confess the truth : 
but it does not at all concern the main argument. That was 
a nice notice in the Gardeners' Chronicle. I hope and imagine 
that Lindley is almost a convert Do not forget to tell me 
if Bentham gets at all more staggered. 

With respect to tropical plants during the Glacial period, 
I throw in your teeth your own facts, at the base of the 
Himalaya, on the possibility of the co-existence of at least 
forms of the tropical and temperate regions. I can give a 
parallel case for animals in Mexico. Oh 1 my dearly beloved 
puny child, how cruel men are to you 1 I am very glad you

for note. I am beyond measure glad that you get more 
and more roused on the subject of species, for, as I have 
always said, I am well convinced that your opinions and 
writings will do far more to convince the world than mine. 
You will make a grand discussion on man. You are very bold 
in this, and I honour you. I have been, like you, quite sur- 
prised at the want of originality in opposed arguments and 
in favour too. Gwyn Jeffreys attacks me justly in his letter

It includes speculations (which perhaps he will modify) so rash, 
and without a single fact in support, that had I advanced them 
he or other reviewers would have hit me very hard. I am 
sorry to say that I have no “ consolatory view ” on the dignity 
of man. I am content that man will probably advance, and 
care not much whether we are looked at as mere savages in a 
remotely distant future. Many thanks for your last note.

C. Darwin to W. B. Carpenter. 

Down, January 6th [i860] ? 

My dear Carpenter, — I have just read your excellent 
article in the ‘ National.’ It will do great good ; especially if it 
becomes known as your production. It seems to me to give 
an excellently clear account of Mr. Wallace’s and my views. 
How capitally you turn the flanks of the theological opposers 
by opposing to them such men as Bentham and the more 
philosophical of the systematists ! I thank you sincerely for 
the extremely honourable manner in which you mention me. 
I should have liked to have seen some criticisms or remarks 
on embryology, on which subject you are so well instructed. 
I do not think any candid person can read your article with- 
out being much impressed with it. The old doctrine of 
immutability of specific forms will surely but slowly die away. 
It is a shame to give you trouble, but I should be very much 
obliged if you could tell me where differently coloured eggs 
in individuals of the cuckoo have been described, and their 
laying in twenty-seven kinds of nests. Also do you know 
from your own observation that the limbs of sheep imported

C. Darwin to L. Jetty ns.* 

Down, January 7th, i860. 

My dear Jenyns, — I am very much obliged for your 
letter. It is of great use and interest to me to know what 
impression my book produces on philosophical and instructed 
minds. I thank you for the kind things which you say ; and 
you go with me much further than I expected. You will 
think it presumptuous, but I am convinced, if circuinstatues 
lead you to keep the subject in mind, that you will go further. 
No one has yet cast doubts on my explanation of the sub- 
ordination of group to group, on homologies, embryology, 
and rudimentary organs ; and if my explanation of these 
classes of facts be at all right, whole classes of organic beings 
must be included in one line of descent 
The imperfection of the Geological Record is one of the 

greatest difficulties During the earliest period the 

record would be most imperfect, and this seems to me 
sufficiently to account for our not finding intermediate forms 
between the classes in the same great kingdoms. It was 
certainly rash in me putting in my belief of the probability of 
all beings having descended from one primordial form ; but 
as this seems yet to me probable, I am not willing to strike 
it out. Hu.xley alone supports me in this, and something 
could be said in its favour. With respect to man, I am very 
far from wishing to obtrude my belief ; but I thought it 
dishonest to quite conceal my opinion. Of course it is

Pray accept my sincere thanks for your kind note. Your 
going some way with me gives me great confidence that I am 
not very wrong. For a very long time I halted half-way ; but 
I do not believe that any enquiring mind will rest half-way. 
People will have to reject all or admit all ; by all, I mean 
only the members of each great kingdom.

to you, and several verbal ones to you and others ; I am 
heartily glad you approve of them, as yet only two things 
have annoyed me; those confounded millions t of years (not 
that I think it is probably wrong), and my not having (by 
inadvertence) mentioned Wallace towards the close of the 
book in the summary, not that any one has noticed this to me. 
I have now put in Wallace’s name at p. 484 in a conspicuous 
place. I cannot refer you to tables of mortality of children. 
Sic. Sic. I have notes somewhere, but I have not the least 
idea where to hunt, and my notes would now be old. I shall

I suspect I shall have to return the caution a hundred fold ! 
Yours will, no doubt, be a grand discussion ; but it will 
horrify the world at first more than my whole volume ; 
although by the sentence (p. 489, new edition *) I show that 
I believe man is in the same predicament with other animals. 
It is in fact impossible to doubt it I have thought (only 
vaguely) on man. With respect to the races, one of my best 
chances of truth has broken down from the impossibility of 
getting facts. I have one good speculative line, but a man 
must have entire credence in Natural Selection before he will 
even listen to it. Psychologically, I have done scarcely any- 
thing. Unless, indeed, expression of countenance can be 
included, and on that subject I have collected a good many 
facts, and speculated, but I do not suppose I shall ever 
publish, but it is an uncommonly curious subject. By the 
way I sent off a lot of questions the day before yesterday 
to Tierra del Fuego on expression 1 I suspect (for I have 
never read it) that Spencer’s ‘ Psychology ’ has a bearing on 
Psychology as we should look at it By all means read the

Dictionary, on the first origin of Language ; Erasmus would

with not much original. . . . Andrew Murray has criticised, 
in an address to the Botanical Society of Edinburgh, the 
notice in the ‘Linnean Journal,’ and “has disposed of" the 
whole theory by an ingenious difficulty, which I was very 
stupid not to have thought of ; for I express surprise at more 
and analogous cases not being known. The difficulty is, that 
amongst the blind insects of the caves in distant parts of the 
world there are some of the same genus, and yet the genus is 
not found out of the caves or living in the free world. I have 
little doubt that, like the fish Amblyopsis, and like Proteus in 
Europe, these insects are “wrecks of ancient life,” or "living 
fossils," saved from competition and e.xtermination. But that

... I shall be much interested in reading your man dis- 
cussion, and will give my opinion carefully, whatever that 
may be worth ; but I have so long looked at you as the type 
of cautious scientific judgment (to my mind one of the 
highest and most useful qualities), that I suspect my opinion 
will be superfluous. It makes me laugh to think what a joke 
it will be if I have to caution you, after your cautions on the 
same subject to me 1

Huxley’s opinion on his classification of man ; without

by getting Murray to publish my book. I never till to-day 
realised that it was getting widely distributed ; for in a letter 
from a lady to-day to E., she says she heard a man enquiring 
for it at the Railway Station! ! ! at Waterloo Bridge ; and the 
bookseller said that he had none till the new edition was

it was a very remarkable book !!!....

and you must write a review on my book I I thought it * a

my kind and good friend, it has warmed my heart with all the 
honourable and noble things you say of me and it. I was a

discussed in relation to the ‘ Origin of Species.’ Mr. West-

against the doctrine of descent, such as the identity of the 
figures of ostriches on the ancient “ Egyptian records,” with 
the bird as we now know it. The correspondence is hardly

Cambridge, Mass., 

January 5th, i86a 

My dear Hooker, — Your last letter, which reached me 
just before Christmas, has got mislaid during the upturnings 
in my study which take place at that season, and has not yet 
been discovered. I should be very sorry to lose it, for there 
were in it some botanical mems. which I had not secured. . . 

The principal part of your letter was high laudation of 
Darwin’s book. 

Well, the book has reached me, and I finished its careful 
perusal four days ago ; and I freely say that your laudation 
is not out of place. 

It is done in a masterly manner. It might well have taken 
twenty years to produce it It is crammed full of most 
interesting matter — thoroughly digested — well expressed — 
close, cogent, and taken as a system it makes out a better 
case than I had supposed possible. . . . 

Agassiz, when I saw him last, had read but a part of it 
He says it is poor — very poor!} (entre nous). The fact [is] 
he is very much annoyed by it, ... . and I do not wonder 
at it. To bring all ideal system within the domain of science, 
and give good physical or natural explanations of all his 
capital points, is as bad as to have Forbes take the glacier 
materials . . . and give scientific explanation of all the 
phenomena. 

Tell Darwin all this. I will write to him when I get a 
chance. As I have promised, he and you shall have fair-play 
here. ... I must myself write a review of Darwin’s book for 
‘ Silliman’s Journal ’ (the more so that I suspect Agassiz means 
to come out upon it) for the next (March) No., and I am now 
setting about it (when I ought to be every moment working 
the Expl[oring] Expedition Compositae, which I know far more 
about). And really it is no ea.sy job as you may well imagine.

I doubt if I shall please you altogether. I know I shall

Press, and the book will excite much attention here, and 
some controversy. . . . 



C. Darwin to Asa Gray. 

Down, January 28th [i860]. 

My DEAR Gray, — Hooker has forwarded to me your letter 
to him ; and I cannot express how deeply it has gratified 
me. To receive the approval of a man whom one has long 
sincerely respected, and whose judgment and knowledge are 
most universally admitted, is the highest reward an author 
can possibly wish for; and I thank you heartily for your 
most kind expressions. 

I have been absent from home for a few days, and so could 
not earlier answer your letter to me of the loth of January. 
You have been extremely kind to take so much trouble and 
interest about the edition. It has been a mistake of my 
publisher not thinking of sending over the sheets. I had 
entirely and utterly forgotten your offer of receiving the 
sheets as printed off. But I must not blame my publisher, 
for had I remembered your most kind offer I feel pretty sure 
I should not have taken advantage of it ; for I never dreamed 
of my book being so successful with general readers : I believe 
I should have laughed at the idea of sending the sheets to 
America.* 

After much consideration, and on the strong advice of Lyell 
and others, I have resolved to have the present book as it is

history of the subject. These I will set about, as they must 
some day be done, and I will send them to you in a short time 
— the few corrections first, and the preface afterwards, unless 
I hear that you have given up all idea of a separate edition. 
You will then be able to judge whether it is worth having

Asa Gray to C. Darwin. 

Cambridge, January 23rd, i860. 

My DEAR Darwin, — You have my hurried letter telling 
you of the arrival of the remainder of the sheets of the reprint, 
and of the stir I had made for a reprint in Boston. Well, all 
looked pretty well, when, lo, we found that a second New 
York publishing house had announced a reprint also! I wrote 
then to both New York publishers, asking them to give way 
to the author and his reprint of a revised edition. I got 
an answer from the Harpers that they withdraw — from the 
Applctons that they had got the book out (and the next day 
I saw a copy) ; but that, “ if the work should have any con- 
siderable sale, we certainly shall be disposed to pay the 
author reasonably and liberally.” 

The Applctons being thus out with their reprint, the Boston 
house declined to go on. So I wrote to the Applctons taking

them at their word, offering to aid their reprint, to give them 
the use of the alterations in the London reprint, as soon as I 
find out what they are, &c. &c. And I sent them the first 
leaf, and asked them to insert in their future issue the addi- 
tional matter from Butler,* which tells just right. So there 
the matter stands. If you furnish any matter in advance of 
the London third edition, I will make them pay for it 

I may get something for you. All got is clear gain ; but it 
will not be very much, I suppose. 

Such little notices in the papers here as have yet appeared 
are quite handsome and considerate. 

I hope next week to get printed sheets of my review from 
New Haven, and send [them] to you, and will ask you to pass 
them on to Dr. Hooker. 

To fulfil your request, I ought to tell you what I think 
the weakest, and what the best, part of your book. But 
this is not easy, nor to be done in a word or hvo. The best 
part, I think, is the w/iole, i.e. its plan and treatment, the vast 
amount of facts and acute inferences handled as if you had a 
perfect mastery of them. I do not think twenty years too 
much time to produce such a book in. 

Style clear and good, but now and then wants revision for 
little matters (p. 97, self-fertilises itself, &c.). 

Then your candour is worth everything to your cause. It 
is refreshing to find a person with a new theory who frankly 
confesses that he finds difficulties, insurmountable, at least 
for the present. I know some people who never have any 
difficulties to speak of. 

The moment I understood your premisses, I felt sure you 
had a real foundation to hold on. Well, if one admits your 
premisses, I do not see how he is to stop short of your conclu- 
sions, as a probable hypothesis at least.

THE ‘ORIGIN OF SPECIES.’ 



[i860. 

It naturally happens that my review of your book does not 
exhibit anything like the full force of the impression the book 
has made upon me. Under the circumstances I suppose I do 
your theory more good here, by bespeaking for it a fair and 
favourable consideration, and by standing non-committed as 
to its full conclusions, than I should if I announced myself a 
convert ; nor could I say the latter, with truth. 

Well, what seems to me the weakest point in the book is 
the attempt to account for the formation of organs, the making 
of eyes, &c., by natural selection. Some of this reads quite 
Lamarckian. 

The chapter on Hybridism is not a weak, but a strong 
chapter. You have done wonders there. But still you have 
not accounted, as you may be held to account, for divergence 
up to a certain extent producing increased fertility of the 
crosses, but carried one short almost imperceptible step more, 
giving rise to sterility, or reversing the tendency. Very likely 
you are on the right track ; but you have something to do yet 
in that department. 

Enough for the present. 

I am not insensible to your compliments, the very 

high compliment which you pay me in valuing my opinion. 
You evidently think more of it than I do, though from the 
way I write [to] you, and especially [to] Hooker, this might 
not be inferred from the reading of my letters. 

I am free to say that I never learnt so much from one book 
as I have from yours. There remain a thousand things I long 
to say about it 

Ever yours, 

Asa Gray.

and I wish I could feel all was deserved by me. I quite think 
a review from a man, who is not an entire convert, if fair and 
moderately favourable, is in all respects the best kind of 
review. About the weak points I agree. The eye to this 
day gives me a cold shudder, but when I think of the fine

mind as the judges whose opinions 1 should value most of all. 

My dear Gray, yours most sincerely, 

C. Darwin. 

P.S.-.-I feel pretty sure, from my own experience, that if 
you are led by your studies to keep the subject of the origin 
of species before your mind, you will go further and further 
in your belief. It took me long years, and I assure you I am 
astonished at the impression my book has made on many 
minds. I fear twenty years ago I should not have been half 
as candid and open to conviction.

My dear Hooker, — I have resolved to publish a little 
sketch of the progress of opinion on the change of species. 
Will you or Mrs. Hooker do me the favour to copy one 
sentence out of Naudin’s paper in the ‘Revue Horticolc,’ 
1852, p. 103, namely, that on his principle of Finalit6. Can

you let me have it soon, with those confounded dashes over 
the vowels put in carefully ? Asa Gray, I believe, is going to 
get a second edition of my book, and I want to send this little 
preface over to him soon. I did not think of the necessity of 
having Naudin’s sentence on finality, otherwise I would have 
copied it 

Yours affectionately, 

C. Darwin. 

P.S. — I shall end by just alluding to your Australian 
Flora Introduction. What was the date of publication : 
December 1859, or January i860? Please answer this. 

My preface will also do for the French edition, which, I 
believe, is agreed on. 



C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

February [i860]. 

.... As the ‘ Origin ’ now stands, Harvey’s • is a good 
hit against my talking so much of the insensibly fine grada- 
tions ; and certainly it has astonished me that I should be 
pelted with the fact, that I had not allowed abrupt and great 
enough variations under nature. It would take a good deal 
more evidence to make me admit that forms have often 
changed by saltum. 



* William Henry Harvey was 
descended from a Quaker family of 
Youghal, and was bom in Feb- 
ruary, 1811, at Summerville, a 
country house on the banks of the 
Sh<innon. He died at Torquay in 
1866. In 1835, Harvey went to 
Africa (Table Bay) to pursue his 
botanical studies, the results of 
which were given in his ‘ Genera of 
South African Plants.’ In 1838, 
ill-health compelled him to obtain 
leave of absence, and return to 
England for a time ; in 1840 he 
returned to Cape Town, to be again 



compelled by illness to leave. In 
1843 he obtained the appointment 
of Botanical Professor at Trinity 
College, Dublin. In 1854, 1855, 
and 1856 he visited Australia, New 
Zealand, the Friendly and Fiji 
Islands. In 1857 Dr. Harvey 
reached home, and was appointed 
the successor of Professor Allman 
to the Chair of Botany in Dublin 
University. He was author of 
several botanical works, princi- 
pally on Algae. — (From a Memoir 
published in 1869.)

Have you seen Wollaston’s attack in the ‘ Annals ’? • The 
stones are beginning to fly. But Theology has more to do 
with these two attacks than Science. . . . 

[In the above letter a paper by Harvey in the Gardefters’ 
Chronicle, Feb. 18, i860, is alluded to. He describes a case 
of monstrosity in Begonia frigida, in which the “sport" 
differed so much from a normal Begonia that it might have 
served as the type of a distinct natural order. Harvey goes 
on to ai^e that such a case is hostile to the theory of natural 
selection, according to which changes are not supposed to 
take place per saltum, and adds that “ a few such cases would 
overthrow it [Mr. Darwin’s hypothesis] altogether." In the 
following number of the Gardenerd Chronicle Sir J. D. Hooker 
showed that Dr. Harvey had misconceived the bearing of the 
Begonia case, which he further showed to be by no means 
calculated to shake the validity of the doctrine of modification 
by means of natural selection. My father mentions the 
Begonia case in a letter to Lyell (Feb. 18, i860): — 

“ I send by this post an attack in the Gardeners’ Chronicle, 
by Harvey (a first-rate Botanist, as you probably know). It 
seems to me rather strange ; he assumes the permanence 
of monsters, whereas, monsters are generally sterile, and not 
often inheritable. But grant his case, it comes that I have 
been too cautious in not admitting great and sudden varia- 
tions. Here again comes in the mischief of my abstract. In 
the fuller MS. I have discussed a parallel case of a normal 
fish like a monstrous gold-fish.” 

With reference to Sir J. D. Hooker’s reply, my father 
wrote :] 

Down [February 26th, i860]. 

My dear Hooker, — ^Your answer to Harvey seems to me 
admirably good. You would have made a gigantic fortune as

a barrister. What an omission of Harvey’s about the 
graduated state of the flowers ! But what strikes me most is 
that surely I ought to know my own book best, yet, by Jove, 
you have brought forward ever so many arguments which 
I did not think ofl Your reference to classification (viz. I 
presume to such cases as Aspicarpa) is excellent, for the 
monstrous Begonia no doubt in all details would be a Be- 
gonia. I did not think of this, nor of the retrograde step from 
separated sexes to an hermaphrodite state ; nor of the 
lessened fertility of the monster. Proh pudor to me. 

The world would say what a lawyer has been lost in a mere 
botanist ! 

Farewell, my dear master in my own subject. 

Yours affectionately, 

C. Darwin. 

I am so heartily pleased to see that you approve of the 
chapter on Classification. 

I wonder what Harvey will say. But no one hardly, I think, 
is able at first to see when he is beaten in an argument. 

[The following letters refer to the first translation (i860) of 
the ‘ Origin of Species ’ into German, which was superintended 
by H. G. Bronn, a good zoologist and palseontologist,' who 
was at the time at Freiburg, but aftenvards Professor at 
Heidelberg. I have been told that the translation was not a 
success, it remained an obvious translation, and was cor- 
respondingly unpleasant to read. Bronn added to the trans- 
lation an appendix on the difficulties that occurred to him. 
For instance, how can natural selection account for differences 
between species, when these differences appear to be of no 
service to their possessors; e.g., the length of the ears and 
tail, or the folds in the enamel of the teeth of various species 
of rodents? Krause, in his book, ‘Charles Darwin,’ p. 91, 
criticises Bronn’s conduct in this matter, but it will be seen 
that my father actually suggested the addition of Bronn’s

remarks. A more serious charge against Bronn made by 
Krause (op. cit. p. 87) is that he left out passages of which he 
did not approve, as, for instance, the passage (‘ Origin,’ first 
edition, p. 488) “ Light will be thrown on the origin of man 
and his history.” I have no evidence as to whether my 
father did or did not know of these alterations.] 



C. Darwin to H G. Bronn. 

Down, Feb. 4 [i860]. 

Dear and much honoured Sir, — I thank you sincerely 
for your most kind letter ; I feared that you would much dis- 
approve of the ‘ Origin,’ and I sent it to you merely as a mark 
of my sincere respect. I shall read with much interest your 
work on the productions of Islands whenever I receive it I 
thank you cordially for the notice in the ‘ Neues Jahrbuch 
fur Mineralogie,’ and still more for speaking to Schweitzerbart 
about a translation ; for I am most anxious that the great and 
intellectual German people should know something about my 
book. 

1 have told my publisher to send immediately a copy of 
the new* edition to Schweitzerbart, and I have written to 
Schweitzerbart that I give up all right to profit for myself, so 
that I hope a translation will appear. I fear that the book 
will be difficult to translate, and if you could advise Schweit- 
zerbart about a good translator, it would be of very great 
service. Still more, if you would run your eye over the more 
difficult parts of the translation ; but this is too great a favour 
to expect I feel sure that it will be difficult to translate, 
from being so much condensed. 

Again I thank you for your noble and generous sympathy, 
and I remain, with entire respect. 

Yours, truly obliged, 

C. Darwin.

THE ‘ORIGIN OF SPECIES.’ 



[i 860. 



P.S. — The new edition has some few corrections, and I will 
send in MS. some additional corrections, and a short historical 
preface, to Schweitzerbart. 

How interesting you could make the work by editing (I do 
not mean translating) the work, and appending notes of 
refutation or confirmation. The book has sold so very largely 
in England, that an editor would, 1 think, make profit by the 
translation. 

C. Darwin to H. G. Bronn. 

Down, Feb. 14 [i860]. 

My dear and much honoured Sir, — I thank you 
cordially for your extreme kindness in superintending the 
translation. I have mentioned this to some eminent scientific 
men, and they all agree that you have done a noble and 
generous service. If I am proved quite wrong, yet I comfort 
myself in thinking that my book may do some good, as truth 
can only be known by rising victorious from every attack. I 
thank you also much for the review, and for the kind manner 
in which you speak of me. I send with this letter some cor- 
rections and additions to M. Schweitzerbart, and a short 
historical preface. I am not much acquainted with German 
authors, as I read German very slowly ; therefore I do not 
know whether any Germans have advocated similar views 
with mine ; if they have, would you do me the favour to insert 
a foot-note to the preface ? M. Schweitzerbart has now the 
reprint ready for a translator to begin. Several scientific men 
have thought the term “ Natural Selection” good, because its 
meaning is not obvious, and each man could not put on it his 
own interpretation, and because it at once connects variation 
under domestication and nature. Is there any analogous 
term used by German breeders of animals ? “ Adelung,” 

ennobling, would, perhaps, be too metaphorical. It is folly in 
me, but I cannot help doubting whether “Wahl der Lebens- 
weise” expresses my notion. It leaves the impression on my

mind of the Lamarckian doctrine (which I reject) of habits of 
life being all-important. Man has altered, and thus improved 
the English race-horse by selecting successive fleeter indi- 
viduals ; and I believe, owing to the struggle for existence, 
that similar slight variations in a wild horse, if advantageous 
to it, would be selected or preserved by nature ; hence Natural 
Selection. But I apologise for troubling you with these 
remarks on the importance of choosing good German terms 
for "Natural Selection.” With my heartfelt thanks, and with 
sincere respect, 

I remain, dear Sir, yours very sincerely, 

Charles Darwin. 

C. Darwin to H. G. Bronn. 

Down July 14 [i860]. 

Dear and honoured Sir, — On my return home, after an 
absence of some time, I found the translation of the third 
part • of the ‘ Origin,’ and I have been delighted to see a final 
chapter of criticisms by yourself. I have read the first few 
paragraphs and final paragraph, and am perfectly contented, 
indeed more than contented, with the generous and candid 
spirit with which you have considered my views. You speak 
with too much praise of my work. I shall, of course, care- 
fully read the whole chapter ; but though I can read descrip- 
tive books like Gaertner’s pretty easily, when any reasoning 
comes in, I find German excessively difficult to understand. 
At some future time I should very much like to hear how my 
book has been received in Germany, and I most sincerely 
hope M. Schweitzerbart will not lose money by the publica- 
tion. Most of the reviews have been bitterly opposed to me 
in England, yet I have made some converts, and several 
naturalists who would not believe in a word of it, are now

coming slightly round, and admit that natural selection may 
have done something. This gives me hope that more will 
ultimately come round to a certain extent to my views. 

I shall ever consider myself deeply indebted to you for the 
immense service and honour which you have conferred on me 
in making the excellent translation of my book. Pray believe 
me, with most sincere respect, 

Dear Sir, yours gratefully, 

Charles Darwin. 

C. Darwin to C. Lyell. 

Down [February 12th, i860]. 

... I think it was a great pity that Huxley wasted so 
much time in the lecture on the preliminary remarks ; . . . 
but his lecture seemed to me very fine and very bold. I have 
remonstrated (and he agrees) against the impression that he 
would leave, that sterility was a universal and Infallible cri- 
terion of species. 

You will, I am sure, make a grand discussion on man. I 
am so glad to hear that you and Lady Lyell will come here. 
Pray fix your own time ; and if it did not suit us we would 
say so. We could then discuss man well. . . . 

How much I owe to you and Hooker ! I do not suppose 
I should hardly ever have published had it not been for you. 

[The lecture referred to in the last letter was given at the 
Royal Institution, February 10, i860. The following letter 
was written in reply to Mr. Huxley’s request for information 
about breeding, hybridisation, &c. It is of interest as giving 
a vivid retrospect of the writer’s experience on the subject.]

had to make an abstract of the whole. Herbert’s volume on 
Amaryllidaceae very good, and two excellent papers in the 
‘Horticultural Journal.’ For animals, no rfesum^ to be trusted 
at all ; facts are to be collected from all original sources.* 
I fear my MS. for the, bigger book (twice or thrice as long 
as in present book), with all references, would be illegible, 
but it would save you infinite labour ; of course I would 
gladly lend it, but I have no copy, so care would have to be 
taken of it. But my accursed handwriting would be fatal. 

About breeding, I know of no one book. I did not think 
well of Lowe, but I can name none better. Youatt I look at 
as a far better and more practical authority ; but then his views 
and facts are scattered through three or four thick volumes. 
I have picked up most by reading really numberless special 
treatises and all agricultural and horticultural journals ; but 
it is a work of long years. The difficulty is to know what to 
trust. No one or two statements are worth a farthing; the 
facts are so complicated. I hope and think I have been 
really cautious in what I state on this subject, although all 
that I have given, as yet, is far too briefly. I have found it 
very important associating with fanciers and breeders. For 
instance, I sat one evening in a gin palace in the Borough 
amongst a set of pigeon fanciers, when it was hinted that 
Mr. Bull had crossed his Pouters with Runts to gain size ; and 



* This caution is exemplified in 
the following extract from an earlier 
letter to Professor Huxley ; — “ The 
inaccuracy of the blessed gang (of 
which 1 am one) of compilers passes 
all bounds. Monsters have fre- 
quently been described as hybrids 
without a tittle of evidence. I must 
give one other case to show how 
we jolly fellows work. A Belgian 
Baron (I forget his name at this 
moment) crossed two distinct geese 
and got seven hybrids, , which he 



proved subsequently to be quite 
sterile ; well, compiler the first, 
Chevreul, says that the hybrids were 

inter se. Compiler second (Morton) 
mistakes the French name, and 
gives latin names for two more 
distinct geese, and says Chevreul 
himself propagated them inter se 
for seven generations ; and the latter 
statement is copied from book to 
book.”

[i860. 



if you had seen the solemn, the mysterious, and awful shakes 
of the head which all the fanciers gave at this scandalous 
proceeding, you would have recognised how little crossing 
has had to do with improving breeds, and how dangerous for 
endless generations the process was. All this was brought 
home far more vividly than by pages of mere statements, &c. 
But I am scribbling foolishly. I really do not know how to 
advise about getting up facts on breeding and improving 
breeds. Go to Shows is one way. Read all treatises on any 
one domestic animal, and believe nothing without largely 
confirmed. For your lectures I can give you a few amusing 
anecdotes and sentences, if you want to make the audience 
laugh. 

I thank you particularly for telling me what naturalists 
think. If we can once make a compact set of believers we 
shall in time conquer. I am eminently glad Ramsay is on 
our side, for he is, in my opinion, a first-rate geologist I sent 
him a copy. I hope he got it I shall be very curious to 
hear whether any effect has been produced on Prestwich ; I 
sent him a copy, not as a friend, but owing to a sentence 
or two in some paper, which made me suspect he was 
doubting. 

Rev. C. Kingsley has a mind to come round. Quatrefagcs 
writes that he goes some long way with me ; says he exhibited 
diagrams like mine. With most hearty thanks. 

Yours very tired, 

C. Darwin. 

[I give the conclusion of Professor Huxley’s lecture, as 
being one of the earliest, as well as one of the most eloquent, 
of his utterances in support of the ‘ Origin of Species ’ : 

“ I have said that the man of science is the sworn inter- 
preter of nature in the high court of reason. But of what 
avail is his honest speech, if ignorance is the assessor of the 
judge, and prejudice the foreman of the jury? I hardly know

of a great physical truth, whose universal reception has not 
been preceded by an epoch in which most estimable per- 
sons have maintained that the phenomena investigated were 
directly dependent on the Divine Will, and that the attempt 
to investigate them was not only futile, but blasphemous. 
And there is a wonderful tenacity of life about this sort of 
opposition to physical science. Crushed and maimed in every 
battle, it yet seems never to be slain ; and after a hundred 
defeats it is at this day as rampant, though happily not so 
mischievous, as in the time of Galileo. 

“ But to those whose life is spent, to use Newton’s noble 
words, in picking up here a pebble and there a pebble on the 
shores of the great ocean of truth — ^who watch, day by day, 
the slow but sure advance of that mighty tide, bearing on its 
bosom the thousand treasures wherewith man ennobles and 
beautifies his life — it would be laughable, if it were not so sad, 
to see the little Canutes of the hour enthroned in solemn 
state, bidding that great wave to stay, and threatening to 
check its beneficent progress. The wave rises and they fly ; 
but, unlike the brave old Dane, they learn no lesson of 
humility : the throne is pitched at what seems a safe distance, 
and the folly is repeated. 

“ Surely it is the duty of the public to discourage anything 
of this kind, to discredit these foolish meddlers who think 
they do the Almighty a service by preventing a thorough 
study of His works. 

“ The Origin of Species is not the first, and it will not be 
the last, of the great questions bom of science, which will 
demand settlement from this generation. The general mind 
is seething strangely, and to those who watch the signs of the 
times, it seems plain that this nineteenth century will see 
revolutions of thought and practice as great as those which 
the sixteenth witnessed. Through what trials and sore con- 
tests the civilised world will have to pass in the course of this 
new reformation, who can tell ?

“ But I verily believe that come what will, the part which 
England may play in the battle is a grand and a noble one. 
She may prove to the world that, for one people, at any rate, 
despotism and demagogy are not the necessary alternatives 
of government ; that freedom and order are not incompatible ; 
that reverence is the handmaid of knowledge ; that free 
discussion is the life of truth, and of true unity in a nation.

thanks him for his kind manner of speaking about him. I 
have also told him that he would be pleased to hear that the 
Bishop of Oxford says it is the most unphilosophical * work 
he ever read. The review seems to me clever, and only mis- 
interprets me in a few places. Like all hostile men, he passes 
over the explanation given of Classification, Morphology, 
Embiyology, and Rudimentary Organs, &c. I read Wallace’s 
paper in MS.,f and thought it admirably good ; he does not 
know that he has been anticipated about the depth of inter- 
vening sea determining distribution. . . . The most curious

further confirmation. . . .

he is in much the same state as Bunbury,t and will go a very

out of it ; I wish I could quite agree with him. Baden Powell 
says he never read anything so conclusive as my statement 
about the eye 1 ! A stranger writes to me about sexual selec- 
tion, and regrets that I boggle about such a trifle as the brush 
of hair on the male turkey, and so on. As L. Jenyns has 
a really philosophical mind, and as you say you like to see 
everything, I send an old letter of his. In a later letter to 
Henslow, which I have seen, he is more candid than any

My dear Gray, — I received about a week ago two sheets 
of your Review ;f read them, and sent them to Hooker ; they 
are now returned and re-read with care, and to-morrow I 
send them to Lyell. Your Review seems to me admirable; 
by far the best which I have read. I thank you from my 
heart both for myself, but far more for the subject’s sake. 
Your contrast between the views of Agassiz and such as mine 
is very curious and instructive.^ By the way, if Agassiz 
writes anything on the subject, I hope you will tell me. I am 
charmed with your metaphor of the streamlet never running 
against the force of gravitation. Your distinction between 
an hypothesis and theory seems to me very ingenious ; but I 
do not think it is ever followed. Every one now speaks of the 
undulatory theory of light ; yet the ether is itself hypothetical, 
and the undulations are inferred only from explaining the 
phenomena of light Even in the theory of gravitation is the 
attractive power in any way known, except by explaining 
the fall of the apple, and the movements of the Planets ? It 
seems to mo that an hypothesis is developed into a theory 
solely by explaining an ample lot of facts. Again and again I

Dear Sir, — I have to thank you for the unexpected 
honour of your book. That the Naturalist whom, of all 
naturalists living, I most wish to know and to learn from, 
should have sent a scientist like me his book, encourages me 
at least to observe more carefully, and think more slowly. 

I am so poorly (in brain), that I fear I cannot read your 
book just now as I ought All I have seen of it awes me ; 
both with the heap of facts and tho prestige of your name, 
and also with the clear intuition, that if you be right, I must 
give up much that I have believed and written.

(2.) I have gradually learnt to see that it is just as noble 
a conception of Deity, to believe that He created primal 
forms capable of self development into all forms needful pro 
tempore and pro loco, as to believe that He required a fresh 
act of intervention to supply the laatnas which He Himself 
had made. I question whether the former be not the loftier 
thought. 

Be it as it may, I shall prize your book, both for itself, 
and as a proof that you are aware of the existence of such a 
person as 

Your faithful servant,

Brodie, who was for many years Vicar of Down, writes in the

study of natural history, geology, and science in general, 
should be pursued without reference to the Bible. That the

source, ran in parallel lines, and when properly understood 
would never cross 

“ His views on this subject were very much to the same effect 
from his side. Of course any conversations we may have had 
on purely religious subjects are as sacredly private now as in 
his life ; but the quaint conclusion of one may be given. We 
had been speaking of the apparent contradiction of some sup- 
posed discoveries with the Book of Genesis ; he said, ‘ you 
are (it would have been more correct to say you ought to be) 
a theologian, I am a naturalist, the lines are separate. I en- 
deavour to discover facts without considering what is said in 
the Book of Genesis. I do not attack Moses, and I think 
Moses can take care of himself.’ To the same effect he wrote 
more recently, ‘ I cannot remember that I ever published a

word directly against religion or the clergy ; but if you were 
to read a little pamphlet which I received a couple of days 
ago by a clergyman, you would laugh, and admit that I had 
some excuse for bitterness. After abusing me for two or three 
pages, in language sufficiently plain and emphatic to have 
satisfied any reasonable man, he sums up by saying that he 
has vainly searched the English language to find terms to 
express his contempt for me and all Darwinians.’ In another 
letter, after I had left Down, he writes, ‘ We often differed, 
but you are one of those rare mortals from whom one can 
differ and yet feel no shade of animosity, and that is a thing 
fof] which I should feel very proud, if any one could say [it] 
of me.’ 

“ On my last visit to Down, Mr. Darwin said, at his dinner- 
table, ‘Brodie Innes and I have been fast friends for thirty 
years, and we never thoroughly agreed on any subject but 
once, and then we stared hard at each other, and thought one 
of us must be very ill.’ ”] 

C. Darwin to C. Lyell. 

Down, February 23rd [i860]. 

My dear Lyell, — That is a splendid answer of the father 
of Judge Crampton. How curious that the Judge should have 
hit on exactly the same points as yourself. It shows me what 
a capital lawyer you would have made, how many unjust acts 
you would have made appear just I But how much grander a 
field has science been than the law, though the latter might 
have made you Lord Kinnordy. I will, if there be another 
edition, enlarge on gradation in the eye, and on all forms 
coming from one prototype, so as to tty and make both less 
glaringly improbable. . . . 

With respect to Bronn’s objection that it cannot be shown 
how life arises, and likewise to a certain extent Asa Gray’s 
remark that natural selection is not a vera causa, I was much

interested by finding accidentally in Brewster’s ‘Life of 
Newton,’ that Leibnitz objected to the law of gravity because 
Newton could not show what gravity itself is. As it has. 
chanced, I have used in letters this very same argument, 
little knowing that any one had really thus objected to the law 
of gravity. Newton answers by saying that it is philosophy 
to make out the movements of a clock, though you do not 
know why the weight descends to the ground. Leibnitz fur- 
ther objected that the law of gravity was opposed to Natural 
Religion ! Is this not curious ? I really think I shall use the 
facts for some introductory remarks for my bigger book. 

. . . You ask (I see) why we do not have monstrosities in 
higher animals ; but when they live they are almost always 
sterile (even giants and dwarfs are generally sterile), and we do 
not know that Harvey’s monster would have bred. There is 
I believe only one case on record of a peloric flower being 
fertile, and I cannot remember whether this reproduced itself.. 

To recur to the eye. I really think it would have been dis- 
honest, not to have faced the difficulty ; and worse (as Talley- 
rand would have said), it would have been impolitic I think, 
for it would have been thrown in my teeth, as H. Holland 
threw the bones of the ear, till Huxley shut him up by showing 
what a fine gradation occurred amongst living creatures. 

I thank you much for your most pleasant letter. 

Yours affectionately, 

C. Darwin. 

P.S. — I send a letter by Herbert Spencer, which you can 
read or not as you think fit. He puts, to my mind, the 
philosophy of the argument better than almost any one, 
at the close of the letter. I could make nothing of Dana’s 
idealistic notions about species ; but then, as Wollaston says, 
I have not a metaphysical head. 

By the way, I have thrown at Wollaston’s head, a paper hy

our cultivated races are God-created species.

My dear Hooker, — What a day’s work you had on that 
Thursday 1 I was not able to go to London till Monday, and 
then I was a fool for going, for, on Tuesday night, I had an 
attack of fever (with a touch of pleurisy), which came on

good bit 

I was much interested by your last note. ... I think you 
expect too much in regard to change of opinion on the sub- 
ject of Species. One large class of men, more especially I 
suspect of naturalists, never will care about any general ques- 
tion, of which old Gray, of the British Museum, may be taken 
as a type ; and secondly, nearly all men past a moderate age, 
cither in actual years or in mind, are, I am fully convinced, 
incapable of looking at facts under a new point of view.

but, with such a list, I feel convinced the subject will not. 
The outsiders, as you say, are strong. 

You say that you think that Bentham is touched, “but, 
like a wise man, holds his tongue." Perhaps you only mean 
that he cannot decide, othenvise I should think such silence 
the reverse of magnanimity ; for if others behaved the same 
way, how would opinion ever progress? It is a dereliction of 
actual duty.f 

I am so glad to hear about Thwaites.J ... I have had an 
astounding letter from Dr. Boott ; § it might be turned into 
ridicule against him and me, so I will not send it to any one. 
He writes in a noble spirit of love of truth. 

I wonder what Lindley thinks ; probably too busy to read 
or think on the question. 

I am vexed about Bentham’s reticence, for it, would have 
been of real value to know what parts appeared weakest to a 
man of his powers of observation. 

Farewell, my dear Hooker, yours affectionately,

t Dr. G. J. K. Thwaites, who

reputation in this country as an 
expert microscopist and an acute 
observer, working especially at 
cryptogamic botany. On his ap- 
pointment as Director of the 
Botanic Gardens at Peradenyia, 
Ceylon, Dr. Thwaites devoted him- 
self to the flora of Ceylon. As a 



result of this he has left numerous 
and valuable collections, a descrip- 
tion of which he embodied in his 
‘ Enumeratio Plantarum Zeylaniae ’ 
(1864). Dr. Thwaites was a Fellow 
of the Linnean Society, but beyond 
the above facts, little seems to have 
been recorded of his life. His death 
occurred in Ceylon on September

was never admitted into his intimacy, and he therefore never 
made any communications to me in relation to his views and 
labours. I have been throughout one of his most sincere 
admirers, and fully adopted his theories and conclusions, 
notwithstanding the severe pain and disappointment they at 
first occasioned me. On the day that his celebrated paper 
was read at the Linnean Society, July ist, 1858, a long paper 
of mine had been set down for reading, in which, in com- 
menting on the British Flora, I had collected a number of 
observations and facts illustrating what I then believed to be 
a fixity in species, however difficult it might be to assign their 
limits, and showing a tendency of abnormal forms produced 
by cultivation or otherwise, to withdraw within those original 
limits when left to themselves. Most fortunately my paper 
had to give way to Mr. Darwin’s, and when once that was 
read, I felt bound to defer mine for reconsideration ; I began 
to entertain doubts on the subject, and on the appearance of 
the ‘ Origin of Species,’ I was forced, however reluctantly, to 
give up my long-cherished convictions, the results of much 
labour and study, and I cancelled all that part of my paper 
which urged original fixity, and published only portions of 
the remainder in another form, chiefly in the ‘Natural History 
Review.’ I have since acknowledged on various occasions 
my full adoption of Mr. Danvin’s views, and chiefly in my 
Presidential Address of 1863, and in my thirteenth and last 
address, issued in the form of a report to the British Associa- 
tion at its meeting at Belfast in 1874. 

I prize so highly the letters that I have of Mr. Danvin’s, 
that I should feel obliged by your returning them to me when 
you have done with them. Unfortunately I have not kept 
the envelopes, and Mr. Darwin usually only dated them by 
the month not by the year, so that they are not in any 
chronological order. 

Yours very sincerely, 

George Bentham.

C. Darwin to C. Lyell. 

Down [March] 12th [i860]. 

My dear Lyell, — Thinking over what we talked about, 
the high state of intellectual development of the old Grecians 
with the little or no subsequent improvement, being an appa- 
rent difficulty, it has just occurred to me that in fact the case 
harmonises perfectly with our views. The case would be a 
decided difficulty on the Lamarckian or Vcstigian doctrine 
of necessary progression, but on the view which I hold of 
progression depending on the conditions, it is no objection at 
all, and harmonises with the other facts of progression in 
the corporeal structure of other animals. For in a state of 
anarchy, or despotism, or bad government, or after irruption 
of barbarians, force, strength, or ferocity, and not intellect, 
would be apt to gain the day. 

We have so enjoyed your and Lady Lyell’s visit 

Good-night 

C. Darwin. 

P.S. — By an odd chance (for I had not alluded even to the 
■subject) the ladies attacked me this evening, and threw the 
high state of old Grecians into my teeth, as an unanswerable 
■difficulty, but by good chance I had my answer all pat, and 
silenced them. Hence I have thought it worth scribbling to

as you could include in a letter. I have always admired your 
various memoirs so much that I should be eminently glad to 
receive your opinion, which might be of real service to me. 

Pray do not suppose that I expect to convert or pervert 
you; if I could stagger you in ever so slight a degree I 
should be satisfied ; nor fear to annoy me by severe criticisms, 
for I have had some hearty kicks from some of my best 
friends. If it would not be disagreeable to you to send me 
your opinion, I certainly should be truly obliged. , . . 

C. Darwin to Asa Gray, 

Down, April 3 [i860]. 

.... I remember well the time when the thought of the 
eye made me cold all over, but I have got over this stage of 
the complaint, and now small trifling particulars of structure 
often make me very uncomfortable. The sight of a feather 
in a peacock’s tail, whenever I gaze at it, -makes me sick ! . . . 

You may like to hear about reviews on my book. Sedg- 
wick (as I and Lycll feel certain from internal evidence) has 
reviewed me savagely and unfairly in the Spectator.* The 
notice includes much abuse, and is hardly fair in several 
respects. He would actually lead any one, who was ignorant 
of geology, to suppose that I had invented the great gaps 
between successive geological formations, instead of its being 
an almost universally admitted dogma. But my dear old 
friend Sedgwick, with his noble heart, is old, and is rabid with 
indignation. It is hard to please every one ; you may 
remember that in my last letter I asked you to leave out 
about the Weald denudation : I told Jukes this (who is head 
man of the Irish geological survey), and he blamed me much, 
for he believed every word of it, and thought it not at all 
exaggerated 1 In fact, geologists have no means of gauging

review, namely, an opposed one (by Pictet,* the palaeontologist, 
in the Bib. Universelle of Geneva) which is perfectly fair and 
just, and I agree to every word he says ; our only difference 
being that he attaches less weight to arguments in favour, 
and more to arguments opposed, than I do. Of all the op- 
posed reviews, I think this the only quite fair one, and I never 
expected to see one. Please observe that I do not class your 
review by any means as opposed, though you think so your- 
self ! It has done me much too good service ever to appear 
in that rank in my eyes. But I fear I shall weary you with 
so much about my book. I should rather think there was a 
good chance of my becoming the most egotistical man in all 
Europe ! What a proud pre-eminence 1 Well, you have

doctrine, that the breaks between successive formations 
marked long intervals of time. It is very unfair. But poor 
dear old Sedgwick seems rabid on the question. “ Demo- 
ralised understanding ! ” If ever I talk with him I will tell 
him that I never could believe that an inquisitor could be a 
good man ; but now I know that a man may roast another, 
and yet have as kind and noble a heart as Sedgwick’s.” 

The following passages arc taken from the review : 

“ I need hardly go on any further with these objections. 
But I cannot conclude without expressing my detestation of 
the theory, because of its unflinching materialism ; — because 
it has deserted the inductive track, the only track that leads 
to physical truth ; — because it utterly repudiates final causes, 
and thereby indicates a demoralised understanding on the 
part of its advocates.” 

“ Not that I believe that Darwin is an atheist ; though I 
cannot but regard his materialism as atheistical. I think it 
untrue, because opposed to the obvious course of nature, and 
the very opposite of inductive truth. And I think it intensely 
mischievous.” 

‘‘Each scries of facts is laced together by a series of 
assumptions, and repetitions of the one false principle. 
You cannot make a good rope out of a string of air 
bubbles.” 

‘‘ But any startling and (supposed) novel paradox, main- 
tained very boldly and with something of imposing plausi- 
bility, produces in some minds a kind of pleasing excitement 
which predisposes them in its favour ; and if they are unused 
to careful reflection, and averse to the labour of accurate 
investigation, they will be likely to conclude that what is 
(apparently) original, must be a production of original genius, 
and that anything very much opposed to prevailing notions 
must be a grand discovery, — in short, that whatever comes 
from the ‘ bottom of a well ’ must be the ‘ truth ’ supposed to 
be hidden there.”

■express my admiration at this most able essay, and I hope to 
God it will be largely read, for it must produce a great effect. 
I ought not, however, to express such warm admiration, for 
you give my book, I fear, far too much praise. But you have 
gratified me extremely ; and though I hope I do not care 
very much for the approbation of the non-scientific readers, I 
■cannot say that this is at all so with respect to such few men 
as yourself. I have not a criticism to make, for I object to 
not a word ; and I admire all, so that I cannot pick out one 
part as better than the rest. It is all so well balanced. But 
it is impossible not to be struck with your extent of knowledge 
in geology, botany, and zoology. The extracts which you 
give from Hooker seem to me excellently chosen, and most 
forcible. I am so much pleased in what you say also about 
Lyell. In fact I am in a fit of enthusiasm, and had better 
write no more. With cordial thanks.

C. Darwin to C. Lyell. 

Down, April loth [iS6o]. 

My dear Lyell, — Thank you much for your note of the 
4th ; I am very glad to hear that you are at Torquay. I should 
have amused myself earlier by writing to you, but I have had 
Hooker and Huxley staying here, and they have fully occupied 
my time, as a little of anything is a full dose for me. . . . 
There has been a plethora of reviews, and I am really quite 
sick of myself. There is a very long review by Carpenter in 
the ‘Medical and Chirurg. Review,’ very good and well balanced, 
but not brilliant. He discusses Hooker's books at as great 
length as mine, and makes excellent extracts ; but I could not 
get Hooker to feel the least interest in being praised. 

Carpenter speaks of you in thoroughly proper terms. There 
is a brilliant review by Huxley, * with capital hits, but I do 
not know that he much advances the subject I think I have 
convinced him that he has hardly allowed weight enough to 
the case of varieties of plants being in some degrees sterile. 

To diverge from reviews : Asa Gray sends me from Wyman 
(who will write), a good case of ali the pigs being black in the 
Everglades of Virginia. On asking about the cause, it seems 
(I have got capital analogous cases) that when the black pigs 
eat a certain nut their bones become red, and they suffer to a 
certain extent, but that the white pigs lose their hoofs and 
perish, " and we aid by selection, for we kill most of the young 
white pigs.” This was said by men who could hardly read. 
By the way, it is a great blow to me that you cannot admit 
the potency of natural selection. The more I think of it, the 
less I doubt its power for great and small changes. I have 

just read the ‘ Edinburgh,’ t which without doubt is by 

It is extremely malignant, clever, and I fear will be very

and very bitter against Hooker. So we three enjoyed it 
together. Not that I really enjoyed it, for it made me 
uncomfortable for one night ; but I have got quite over it 
to-day. It requires much study to appreciate all the bitter 
spite of many of the remarks against me ; indeed I did not 
discover all myself. It scandalously misrepresents many 
parts. He misquotes some passages, altering words within 
inverted commas. . . . 

It is painful to be hated in the intense degree with which 

Now for a curious thing about my book, and then I have 
done. In last Saturday’s Gardeners’ Chronicle j a Mr. Patrick 
Matthew publishes a long extract from his work on ‘ Naval 
Timber and Arboriculture,’ published in 1831, in which he 
briefly but completely anticipates the theory of Natural Selec- 
tion. I have ordered the book, as some few passages arc 
rather obscure, but it is certainly, I think, a complete but not 
developed anticipation I Erasmus always said that surely 
this would be shown to be the case some day. ' Anyhow, one 
may be excused in not having discovered the fact in a work- 
on Naval Timber. 

I heartily hope that your Torquay work may be successful. 
Give my kindest remembrances to Falconer, and I hope he is 
pretty well. Hooker and Huxley (with Mrs. Huxley) were 
extremely pleasant But poor dear Hooker is tired to death 
of my book, and it is a marvel and a prodigy if you are not 
worse tired — if that be possible. Farewell, my dear Lyell, 
Yours affectionately, 

C. Darwin.

should send it (and of this there can hardly be any question), 
and if you think it full and ample enough, please alter the 
date to the day on which you post it, and let that be soon. 
The case in the Gardeners' Chronicle seems a little stronger 
than in Mr. Matthew’s book, for the passages are therein 
scattered in three places ; but it would be mere hair-splitting 
to notice that. If you object to my letter, please return it 
but I do not expect that you will, but I thought that you 
would not object to run your eye over it. My dear Hooker, 
it is a great thing for me to have so good, true, and old a 
friend as you. I owe much for science to my friends. 

Many thanks for Huxley’s lecture. The latter part seemed 
to be grandly eloquent. 

... I have gone over [the ‘ Edinburgh ’] review again, and 
compared passages, and I am astonished at the misrepre- 
sentations. But I am glad I resolved not to answer. Perhaps 
it is selfish, but to answer and think more on the subject is 
too unpleasant I am so sorry that Huxley by my means 
has been thus atrociously attacked. I do not suppose you 
much care about the gratuitous attack on you.

Chronicle, i860, p. 362, April 21st) : 
“ I have been much interested by 
Mr. Patrick Matthew’s communi-

planation which I have offered of 
the origin of species, under the 
name of natural selection. I think 
that no one will feel surprised 
that neither I, nor apparently any

Lyell in his letter remarked that you seemed to him as if 
you were overworked. Do, pray, be cautious, and remember 
how many and many a man has done this — who thought it 
absurd till too late. I have often thought the same. You 
know that you were bad enough before your Indian journey. 

C. Darwin to C. Lyell. 

Down, April [i860]. 

My dear Lyell, — I was very glad to get your nice long 
letter from Torquay. A press of letters prevented me writing 
to Wells. I was particularly glad to hear what you thought 
about not noticing [the ‘ Edinburgh ’] review. Hooker and 
Huxley thought it a sort of duty to point out the alteration of 
quoted citations, and there is truth in this remark ; but I so 
hated the thought that I resolved not to do so. I shall come 
up to London on Saturday the 14th, for Sir B. Brodie’s party, 
as I have an accumulation of things to do in London, and will 
(if I do not hear to the contrary) call about a quarter before 
ten on Sunday morning, and sit with you at breakfast, but 
will not sit long, and so take up much of your time. I must say 
one more word about our quasi-thcological controversy about 
natural selection, and let me have your opinion when we meet 
in London. Do you consider that the successive variations in 
the size of the crop of the Pouter Pigeon, which man has accu- 
mulated to please his caprice, have been due to “the creative and 
sustaining powers of Brahma ? ” In the sense that an omni- 
potent and omniscient Deity must order and know everything, 
this must be admitted ; yet, in honest truth, I can hardly 
admit it. It seems preposterous that a maker of a universe 
should care about the crop of a pigeon solely to please man’s 
silly fancies. But if you agree with me in thinking such an 
interposition of the Deity uncalled for, I can see no reason 
whatever for believing in such interpositions in the case of 
natural beings, in which strange and admirable peculiarities

have been naturally selected for the creature’s own benefit 
Imagine a Pouter in a state of nature wading into the water 
and then, being buoyed up by its inflated crop, sailing about 
in search of food. What admiration this would have excited 
— adaptation to the laws of hydrostatic pressure, &c. &c. For 
the life of me I cannot see any difficulty in natural selection 
producing the most exquisite structure, if such structure can 
be arrived at by gradation, and I know from experience how 
hard it is to name any structure towards which at least some 
gradations are not known. 

Ever yours, 

C. Darwin. 

P.S. — The conclusion at which I have come, as I have told 
Asa Gray, is that such a question, as is touched on in tliis 
note, is beyond the human intellect, like “ predestination and 
free will," or the “ origin of evil.” 

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker.

ment is funny. The reviewer says, that if the doctrine were

failed. A very clear view this writer had of the struggle for

.... I am glad you like Adam Bede so much. I was 
charmed with it . . . 

We think you must by mistake have taken with your own 
numbers of the ‘National Review’ my precious number.* 
I wish you would look. 



C. Darwin to Asa Gray. 

Down, April 25th [i860]. 

My dear Gray, — I have no doubt I have to thank you 
for the copy of a review on the ‘ Origin ’ in the ‘ North 
American Review.’ It seems to me clever, and I do not 
doubt will damage my book. I had meant to have made 
some remarks on it ; but Lycll wished much to keep it, and 
my head is quite confused between the many reviews which 
I have lately read. I am sure the reviewer is wrong about 
bees’ cells, i.e. about the distance ; any lesser distance would 
do, or even greater distance, but then some of the places 
would lie outside the generative spheres ; but this would 
not add much difficulty to the work. The reviewer takes a 
strange view of instinct : he seems to regard intelligence as 
a developed instinct ; which I believe to be wholly false. I 
suspect he has never much attended to instinct and the 
minds of animals, except perhaps by reading. 

My chief object is to ask you if you could procure for me 
a copy of the New York Times for Wednesday, March 28th. 
It contains a very striking review of my book, which I should 
much like to keep. How curious that the two most striking 
reviews {j.e. yours and this) should have appeared in America. 
This review is not really useful, but somehow is impressive. 
There was a good review in the ‘ Revue des Deux Mondes,’ 
April 1st, by M. Laugel, said to be a very clever man. 

* This no doubt refers to the January number, containing Dr. 
Carpenter’s review of the ‘ Origin.’

‘ORIGIN OF SPECIES.’ 



[i860. 



Hooker, about a fortnight ago, stayed here a few days, and 
was very pleasant ; but I think he overworks himself. What 
a gigantic undertaking, I imagine, his and Bentham’s ‘ Genera 
Flantarum ’ will be ! I hope he will not get too much im- 
mersed in it, so as not to spare some time for Geographical 
Distribution and other such questions. 

I have begun to work steadily, but very slowly as usual, at 
details on variation under domestication. 

My dear Gray, 

Yours always truly and gratefully, 

C. Darwin. 



C. Darwin to C Lyell. 

Down [May 8th, i860]. 

I have sent for the ‘ Canadian Naturalist.’ If I 

cannot procure a copy I will borrow yours. I had a letter 
from Henslow this morning, who says that Sedgwick was, on 
last Monday night, to open a battery on me at the Cambridge 
Philosophical Society. Anyhow, I am much honoured by 
being attacked there, and at the Royal Society of Edinburgh. 

I do not think it worth while to contradict single cases, nor 
is it worth while arguing against those who do not attend to 
what I state. A moment’s reflection will show you that there 
must be (on our doctrine) large genera not varying (see p. 56 
on the subject, in the second edition of the ‘ Origin’). Though 
I do not there discuss the case in detail. 

It may be sheer bigotry for my own notions, but I prefer to 
the Atlantis, my notion of plants and animals having migra- 
ted from the Old to the New World, or conversely, when 
the climate was much hotter, by approximately the line of 
Behring’s Straits. It is most important, as you say, to see 
living forms of plants going back so far in time. I wonder 
whether we shall ever discover the flora of the dry land of 
the coal period, and find it not so anomalous as the swamp 
or coal-making flora. I am working away over the blessed

But think of Lyell’s progress with Geology. One thing I 
see most plainly, that without Lyell’s, yours, Huxley’s, and 
Carpenter’s aid, my book would have been a mere flash in

has pleased me very much, and I most completely agp-ee with 
you on the parts which are strongest and which are weakest. 
The imperfection of the Geological Record is, as you say, the 
weakest of all ; but yet I am pleased to find that there are 
almost more geological converts than of pursuers of other 
branches of natural science. ... I think geologists are 
more easily converted than simple naturalists, because more 
accustomed to reasoning. Before telling you about the 
progress of opinion on the subject, you must let me say how 
I admire the generous manner in which you speak of my book. 
Most persons would in your position have felt some envy or 
jealousy. How nobly free you seem to be of this common 
failing of mankind. But you speak far too modestly of your- 
self. You would, if you had my leisure, have done the work 
just as well, perhaps better, than I have done it

his conversion, which now is universally known. I hope that 
you have received Hooker’s splendid essay. . . . Yesterday 
I heard from Lyell that a Germap, Dr. Schaaflfhausen,* has

said, “ you will find that some one will have been before you.”

surprise is at the greatness of the sale. No doubt the public 
has been shamefully imposed on 1 for they bought the book 
thinking that it would be nice easy reading. I expect the sale 
to stop soon in England, yet Lyell wrote to me the other day 
that calling at Murray’s he heard that fifty copies had gone in 
the previous forty-eight hours. I am extremely glad that you 
will notice in ‘Silliman’ the additions in the ‘Origin.’ Judging 
from letters (and I have just seen one from Thwaites to 
Hooker), and from remarks, the most serious omission in ray 
book was not explaining how it is, as I believe, that all forms 
do not necessarily advance, how there can now be simple organ- 
isms still existing. ... I hear there is a very severe review on 
me in the ‘ North British,’ by a Rev. Mr. Dunns,* a Free Kirk 
minister, and dabbler in Natural History. I should be very 
glad to see any good American reviews, as they are all more

tion to write atheistically. But I own that I cannot see as 
plainly as others do, and as I should wish to do, evidence of 
design and beneficence on all sides of us. There seems to me 
too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that 
a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly 
created the Ichneumonida: with the express intention of their 
feeding within the living bodies of Caterpillars, or that a cat 
should play with mice. Not believing this, I see no necessity 
in the belief that the eye was expressly designed. On the 
other hand, I cannot anyhow be contented to view this won- 
derful universe, and especially the nature of man, and to 
conclude that everything is the result of brute force. I am 
inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, 
with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out 
of what we may call chance. Not that this notion at all 
satisfies me. I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too 
profound for the human intellect A dog might as well 
speculate on the mind of Newton. Let each man hope and 
believe what he can. Certainly I agree with you that my 
views are not at all necessarily atheistical. The lightning kills 
a man, whether a good one or bad one, owing to the exces- 
sively complex action of natural laws. A child (who may 
turn out an idiot) is born by the action of even more complex 
laws, and I can see no reason why a man, or other animal, 
may not have been aboriginally produced by other laws, and 
that all these laws may have been expressly designed by 
an omniscient Creator, who foresaw every future event and 
consequence. But the more I think the more bewildered I 
become ; as indeed I have probably shown by this letter. 

Most deeply do I feel your generous kindness and interest

difference — p. 501. 

He speaks of my “ clamouring against " all who believe in

I was not sorry for a natural opportunity of writing to 
Harvey, just to show that I was not piqued at his turning 
me and my book into ridicule,* not that I think it was a pro-

that you are interested in watching the progress of opinion 
on the change of Species ; I feared that you were weary of

The battle rages furiously in the United States. Gray 
says he was preparing a speech, which would take i J hours to 
deliver, and which he “fondly hoped would be a stunner.” 
He is fighting splendidly, and there seem to have been 
many discussions with Agassiz and others at the meetings. 
Agassiz pities me much at being so deluded. As for the 
progress of opinion, I clearly see that it will be excessively 
slow, almost as slow as the change of species. ... I am

inclined ; for busy as you are, and seeing many people, the

and misrepresentation. I never knew anything so unfair as 
in discussing cells of bees, his ignoring the case of Melipona, 
which builds combs almost e.xactly intermediate beUveen hive

really understand what I mean by Natural Selection. I am 
inclined to give up the attempt as hopeless. Those who do 
not understand, it seems, cannot be made to understand. 

By the way, I think, we entirely agree, except perhaps that 
I use too forcible language about selection. I entirely agree, 
indeed would almost go further than you when you say that 
climate (i.e. variability from all unknown causes) is "an active 
handmaid, influencing its mistress most materially." Indeed, 
I have never hinted that Natural Selection is “ the efficient 
cause to the exclusion of the other,” i.e. variability from

variation or difference, to be selected. . . . 

How does your book progress (I mean your general sort of 
book on plants), I hope to God you will be more successful 
than I have been in making people understand your meaning. 
I should begin to think myself wholly in the wrong, and that 
I was an utter fool, but then I cannot yet persuade myself, 
that Lyell, and you and Huxley, Carpenter, Asa Gray, and 
Watson, &c, are all fools together. Well, time will show, and

... It consoles me that sneers at Malthus, for that 

clearly shows, mathematician though he may be, he cannot 
understand common reasoning. By the way what a dis- 
couraging example Malthus is, to show during what long 
years the plainest case may be misrepresented and mis- 
understood. I have read the ‘ Future ’ ; how curious it is 
that several of my reviewers should advance such wild 
arguments, as that varieties of dogs and cats do not 
mingle ; and should bring up the old exploded doctrine of 
definite analogies ... I am beginning to despair of ever 
making the majority understand my notions. Even Hopkins

does not thoroughly. By the way, I have been so much 
pleased by the way he personally alludes to me. I must 
be a very bad explainer. I hope to Heaven that you will 
succeed better. Several reviews and several letters have 
shown me too clearly how little I am understood. I suppose 
“ natural selection ” was a bad term ; but to change it now, 
I think, would make confusion worse confounded, nor can I 
think of a better; “Natural Preservation” would not imply 
a preservation of particular varieties, and would seem a 
truism, and would not bring man’s and nature’s selection 
under one point of view. I can only hope by reiterated 
■explanations finally to make the matter clearer. If my MS. 
spreads out, I think I shall publish one volume exclusively 
on variation of animals and plants under domestication. 
I want to show that I have not been quite so rash as many 
suppose. 

Though weary of reviews, I should like to see Lowell's • 
some time. ... I suppose Lowell’s difficulty about instinct is 
the same as Bowen’s ; but it seems to me wholly to rest on 
the assumption that instincts cannot graduate as finely as 
structures. I have stated in my volume that it is hardly 
possible to know which, i.e. whether instinct or structure, 
change first by insensible steps. Probably sometimes instinct, 
sometimes structure. When a British insect feeds on an 
exotic plant, instinct has changed by very small steps, and 
their structures might change so as to fully profit by the 
new food. Or structure might change first, as the direction 
of tusks in one variety of Indian elephants, which leads it to 
attack the tiger in a different manner from other kinds of 
elephants. Thanks for your letter of the 2nd, chiefly about 
Murray. (N.B. Harvey of Dublin gives me, in a letter, the 
argument of tall men marrying short women, as one of great 
weight ! t)

I do not quite understand what you mean by saying, “ that 
the more they prove that you underrate physical conditions, 
the better for you, as Geology comes in to your aid.” 

... I see in Murray and many others one incessant fallacy, 
when alluding to slight differences of physical conditions as 
being very important ; namely, oblivion of the fact that all 
species, except very local ones, range over a considerable 
area, and though exposed to what the world calls considerable 
diversities, yet keep constant. I have just alluded to this in 
the ‘Origin’ in comparing the productions of the Old and 
the New Worlds. Farewell, shall you be at Oxford ? If H.

. . . Lowell’s review • is pleasantly written, but it is clear that 
he is not a naturalist. He quite overlooks the importance of 
the accumulation of mere individual differences, and which, I 
think I can show, is the great agency of change under 
domestication. I have not finished Schaaffhausen, as I read 
German so badly. I have ordered a copy for myself, and 
should like to keep yours till my own arrives, but will return 
it to you instantly if wanted. He admits statements rather 
rashly, as I dare say I do. I see only one sentence as yet at 
all approaching natural selection. 

There is a notice of me in the penultimate number of ‘ All 
the Year Round,’ but not worth consulting ; chiefly a well- 
done hash of my own words. Your last note was very 
interesting and consolatory to me. 

I have expressly stated that I believe physical conditions 
have a more direct effect on plants than on animals. But the

As squared stone, or bricks, or timber, are the indispensable

[The meeting of the British Association at Oxford in i860 
is famous for two pitched battles over the ‘ Origin of Species.’ 
Both of them originated in unimportant papers. On Thurs- 
day, June 28, Dr. Daubeny of Oxford made a communication 
to Section D : “On the final causes of the sexuality of plants, 
with particular reference to Mr. Darwin's work on the ‘ Origin 
of Species.’ ” Mr. Huxley was called on by the President, but 
tried (according to the A thenmum report) to avoid a discus- 
sion, on the ground “ that a general audience, in which senti- 
ment would unduly interfere with intellect, was not the public 
before which such a discussion should be carried on.” How- 
ever, the subject was not allowed to drop. Sir R. Owen 
(I quote from the Atheneeum, July 7, i860), who “wished to 
approach this subject in the spirit of the philosopher,” ex- 
pressed his “ conviction that there were facts by which the 
public could come to some conclusion with regard to the pro- 
babilities of the truth of Mr. Darwin’s theory.” He went on to 
say that the brain of the gorilla “presented more differences, 
as compared with the brain of man, than it did when com- 
pared with the brains of the very lowest and most proble- 
matical of the Quadrumana.” Mr. Huxley replied, and 
gave these assertions a “direct and unqualified contradic- 
tion,” pledging himself to “justify that unusual procedure 
elsewhere,” • a pledge which he amply fulfilled.f On Friday 
there was peace, but on Saturday 30th, the battle arose with

redoubled fury over a paper by Dr. Draper of New York, 
on the ‘ Intellectual development of Europe considered with 
reference to the views of Mr. Darwin.’ 

The following account is from an eye-witness of the scene. 

“ The excitement was tremendous. The Lecture-room, in 
which it had been arranged that the discussion should be held, 
proved far too small for the audience, and the meeting ad- 
journed to the Library of the Museum, which was crammed 
to suffocation long before the champions entered the lists. 
The numbers were estimated at from 700 to lOOO. Had it 
been term-time, or had the general public been admitted, it 
would have been impossible to have accommodated the rush to 
hear the oratory of the bold Bishop. Professor Henslow, the 
President of Section D, occupied the chair, and wisely an- 
nounced in limine that none who had not valid arguments to 
bring forward on one side or the other, would be allowed to 
address the meeting : a caution that proved necessary, for no 
fewer than four combatants had their utterances burked by 
him, because of their indulgence in vague declamation. 

"The Bishop was up to time, and spoke for full half-an- 
hoUr with inimitable spirit, emptiness and unfairness. It was 
evident from his handling of the subject that he had been 
‘crammed ’ up to the throat, and that he knew nothing at first 
hand ; in fact, he used no argument not to be found in his 
‘ Quarterly ’ article. He ridiculed Darwin badly, and Huxley 
savagely, but all in such dulcet tones, so persuasive a manner, 
and in such well-turned periods, that I who had been inclined 
to blame the President for allowing a discussion that could 
serve no scientific purpose, now forgave him from the bottom 
of my heart. Unfortunately the Bishop, hurried along on the 
current of his own eloquence, so far forgot himself as to push 
his attempted advantage to the verge of personality in a tell- 
ing passage in which he turned round and addressed Huxley : 

I forget the precise words, and quote from Lyell. ‘The 
Bishop asked whether Huxley was related by his grand-

father’s or grandmother’s side to an ape.’* Huxley replied to 
the scientific argument of his opponent with force and elo- 
quence, and to the personal allusion with a self-restraint, that 
gave dignity to his crushing rejoinder." 

Many versions of Mr. Huxley’s speech were current : the 
following report of his conclusion is from a letter addressed 
by the late John Richard Green, then an undergraduate, to 
a fellow-student, now Professor Boyd Dawkins. " I asserted, 
and I repeat, that a man has no reason to be ashamed of 
having an ape for his grandfather. If there were an ancestor 
whom I should feel shame in recalling, it would be a man, a 
man of restless and versatile intellect, who, not content with 
an equivocal t success in his own sphere of activity, plunges 
into scientific questions with which he has no real acquaint- 
ance, only to obscure them by an aimless rhetoric, and dis- 
tract the attention of his hearers from the real point at issue 
by eloquent digressions, and skilled appeals to religious 
prejudice.” t 

The letter above quoted continues : 

“ The excitement was now at its height ; a lady fainted and 
had to be carried out, and it was some time before the dis- 
cussion was resumed. Some voices called for Hooker, and 
his name having been handed up, the President invited him to 
give his view of the theory from the Botanical side. This he 
did, demonstrating that the Bishop, by his own showing, had 
never grasped the principles of the ‘ Origin,’ and that he was 
absolutely ignorant of the elements of botanical science. The 
Bishop made no reply, and the meeting broke up.

Daubeny, where the almost sole topic was the battle of the 
‘ Origin,’ and I was much struck with the fair and unpre- 
judiced way in which the black coats and white cravats of 
O.xford discussed the question, and the frankness with which 
they offered their congratulations to the winners in the 
combat.”] 



C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Sudbrook Park, Monday night 

[July and, i860]. 

My dear Hooker, — I have just received your letter. I 
have been very poorly, with almost continuous bad headache 
for forty-eight hours, and I was low enough, and thinking 
what a useless burthen I was to myself and all others, when 
your letter came, and it has so cheered me ; your kindness 
and affection brought tears into my eyes. Talk of fame, 
honour, pleasure, wealth, all are dirt compared with affection ; 
and this is a doctrine with which, I know, from your letter, 
that you will agree with from the bottom of your heart 
. . . How I should have liked to have wandered about 
Oxford with you, if I had been well enough ; and how still 
more I should have liked to have heard you triumphing 
over the Bishop. I am astonished at your success and 
audacity. It is something unintelligible to me how any one 
can argue in public like orators do. - I had no idea you had 
this power. I have read lately so many hostile views, that I 
was beginning to think that perhaps I was wholly in the 

wrong, and that was right when he said the whole subject 

would be forgotten in ten years ; but now that I hear that you 
and Huxley will fight publicly (which I am sure I never 
could do), I fully believe that our cause will, in the long- 
run, prevail. I am glad I was not in Oxford, for I should 
have been overwhelmed, with my [health] in its present state.

C. Darwin to T. H. Huxley. 

Sudbrook Park, Richmond, 

July 3rd (i860). 

.... I had a letter from Oxford, written by Hooker late 
on Sunday night, giving me some account of the awful battles 
which have raged about species at Oxford. He tells me you 
fought nobly with Owen (but I have heard no particulars), 
and that you answered the B. of O. capitally. I often think 
that my friends (and you far beyond others) have good cause 
to hate me, for having stirred up so much mud, and led them 
into so much odious trouble. If I had been a friend of 
myself, I should have hated me. (How to make that sentence 
good English, I know not) But remember, if I had not 
stirred up the mud, some one else certainly soon would. I 
honour your pluck ; I would as soon have died as tried to 
answer the Bishop in such an assembly. . . . 

[On July 20th, my father wrote to Mr. Huxley : 

“ From all that I hear from several quarters, it seems that 
Oxford did the subject great good. It is of enormous im- 
portance, the showing the world that a few first-rate men arc 
not afraid of expressing their opinion.”]

me quite splendidly by quoting the ‘ Anti-Jacobin’ versus

C. Darwin to Asa Gray. 

[Hartficid, Sussex] July 22nd [i860]. 

My dear Gray, — Owing to absence from home at water- 
cure and then having to move my sick girl to whence I am 
now writing, I have only lately read the discussion in Proc. 
American Acad.,* and now I cannot resist expressing my 
sincere admiration of your most clear powers of reasoning. 
As Hooker lately said in a note to me, you are more than 
any one else the thorough master of the subject. I declare 
that you know my book as well as I do myself ; and bring 
to the question new lines of illustration and argument in a 
manner which excites my astonishment and almost my envy ! 
I admire these discussions, I think, almost more than your 
article in Silliman’s Journal. Every single word seems 
weighed carefully, and tells like a 32-pound shot. It makes 
me much wish (but I know that you have not time) that 
you could write more in detail, and give, for instance, the 
facts on the variability of the American wild fruits. The 
Atheneeum has the largest circulation, and I have sent my 
copy to the editor with a request that he would republish 
the first discussion ; I much fear he will not, as he reviewed 
the subject in so hostile a spirit ... I shall be curious (and 
will order) the August number, as soon as I know that it

you have made a mistake in being a botanist, you ought 
to have been a lawyer.

.... Henslow* and Daubeny are shaken. I hear from 
Hooker that he hears from Hochstetter that my views are 
making very considerable progress in Germany, and the good 
workers are discussing the question. Bronn at the end of his 
translation has a chapter of criticism, but it is such difficult 
German that I have not yet read it. Hopkins's review in 
‘Fraser’ is thought the best which has appeared against us. 
I believe that Hopkins is so much opposed because his course 
of study has never led him to reflect much on such subjects 
as geographical distribution, classification, homologies, &c., 
so that he does not feel it a relief to have some kind of 
explanation.

wonder. It is very ably done, and I should like much to

your return whether Bronn’s German translation of the 
‘ Origin ’ has drawn any attention to the subject. Huxley 
is eager about a ‘ Natural History Review,’ which he and 
others are going to edit, and he has got so many first-rate 
assistants, that I really believe he will make it a first-rate 
production. I have been doing nothing, except a little 
botanical work as amusement. I shall hereafter be very 
anxious to hear how your tour has answered. I expect your

... I have laughed at Woodward thinking that you were 
a man who could be influenced in your judgment by the voice 
of the public ; and yet after mortally sneering at him, I was 
obliged to confess to myself, that I had had fears, what the 
effect might be of so many heavy guns fired by great men. 
As I have (sent by Murray) a spare ‘ Quarterly Review,’ I 
send it by this post, as it may amuse you. The Anti-Jacobin 
part amused me. It is full of errors, and Hooker is thinking 
of answering it. There has been a cancelled page ; I should 
like to know what gigantic blunder it contained. Hooker 

says that has played on the Bishop, and made him 

strike whatever note he liked ; he has wished to make the 
article as disagreeable to you as possible. I will send the 
Athenteum in a day or two. 

As you wish to hear what reviews have appeared, I may 
mention that Agassiz has fired off" a shot in the last ‘Silliman,’ 
not good at all, denies variations and rests on the perfection 
of Geological evidence. Asa Gray tells me that a very clever 
friend has been almost converted to our side by this review 
of Agassiz's . . . Professor Parsons * has published in 
the same ‘Silliman’ a speculative paper correcting my 
notions, worth nothing. In the ‘ Highland Agricultural 
Journal’ there is a review by some Entomologist, not worth 
much. This is all that I can remember. ... As Huxley

up with many waggon loads of earth ; and now two or three 
days ago, again it has circularly subsided about two feet 
more. How clearly this shows what is still slowly going on. 
This morning I recommenced work, and am at dogs ; when 
I have written my short discussion on them, I will have it 
copied, and if you like, you can then see how the argument 
stands, about their multiple origin. As you seemed to think 
this important, it might be worth your reading ; though I do 
not feel sure that you will come to the same probable con- 
clusion that I have done. By the way, the Bishop makes a 
very telling case against me, by accumulating several instances 
where I speak very doubtfully ; but this is very unfair, as in 
such cases as this of the dog, the evidence is and must be 
very doubtful. . . .

article, from the ‘Atlantic Monthly,’ I am very glad to 
possess. By the way, the editor of the At/tenseum* has 
inserted your answer to Agassiz, Bowen, and Co., and when 
I therein read them, I admired them even more than at first 
They really seemed to me admirable in their condensation, 
force, clearness and novelty. 

I am surprised that Agassiz did not succeed in writing 
something better. How absurd that logical quibble — “ if 
species do not exist, how can they vary .> " As if any one 
doubted their temporary existence. How coolly he assumes 
that there is some clearly defined distinction between indi- 
vidual differences and varieties. It is no wonder that a man 
who calls identical forms, when found in two countries, dis- 
tinct species, cannot find variation in nature. Again, how 
unreasonable to suppose that domestic varieties selected by 
man for his own fancy (p. 147) should resemble natural 
varieties or species. The whole article seems to me poor ; it 
seems to me hardly worth a detailed answer (even if I could 
do it, and I much doubt whether I possess your skill in 
picking out salient points and driving a nail into them), and 
indeed you have already answered several points. Agassiz’s 
name, no doubt, is a heavy weight against us. . . . 

If you sec Professor Parsons, will you thank him for the 
extremely liberal and fair spirit in which his Essay t is written. 
Please tell him that I reflected much on the chance of favour- 
able monstrosities {i.e. great and sudden variation) arising. I 
have, of course, no objection to this, indeed it would be a great 
aid, but I did not allude to the subject, for, after much labour, 
I could find nothing which satisfied me of the probability of 
such occurrences. There seems to me in almost every case 
too much, too complex, and too beautiful adaptation, in every 
structure to believe in its sudden production. I have alluded 
under the head of beautifully hooked seeds to such possi- 
bility. Monsters are apt to be sterile, or not to transmit

monstrous peculiarities. Look at the fineness of gradation in 
the shells of successive sub-stages of the same great forma- 
tion ; I could give many other considerations which made me 
doubt such view. It holds, to a certain extent, with domestic 
productions no doubt, where man preserves some abrupt 
change in structure. It amused me to see Sir R. Murchison 
quoted as a judge of affinities of animals, and it gave me a 
cold shudder to hear of any one speculating about a true 
crustacean giving birth to a true fish ! •

C. Darwin. 



C. Darwin to C. Lyelt. 

Down, September ist [i860]. 

My dear Lyell, — I have been much interested by your 
letter of the 28th, received this morning. It has delighted me, 
because it demonstrates that you have thought a good deal 
lately on Natural Selection. Few things have surprised me 
more than the entire paucity of objections and difficulties 
new to me in the published reviews. Your remarks are of 
a different stamp and new to me. I will run through them, 
and make a few pleadings such as occur to me. 

I put in the possibility of the Galapagos having been con- 
timwusly joined to America, out of mere subservience to the 
many who believe in Forbes’s doctrine, and did not see the 
danger of admission, about small mammals surviving there 
in such case. The case of the Galapagos, from certain facts 
on littoral sea-shells (viz. Pacific Ocean and South American 
littoral species), in fact convinced me more than in any other 
case of other islands, that the Galapagos had never been

animals, if a crustacean, was so the ovum of a crustacean ? ”

continuously united with the mainland ; it was mere base 
subservience, and terror of Hooker and Co. 

With respect to atolls, I think mammals would hardly 
survive very long, even if the main islands (for as I have 
said in the Coral Book, the outline of groups of atolls 
do not look like a former continent) had been tenanted by 
mammals, from the extremely small area, the very peculiar 
conditions, and the probability that during subsidence all or 
nearly all atolls have been breached and flooded by the sea 
many times during their existence as atolls. 

I cannot conceive any existing reptile being converted into 
a mammal. From homologies I should look at it as certain 
that all mammals had descended from some single pro- 
genitor. What its nature was, it is impossible to speculate. 
More like, probably, the Omithorhynchus or Echidna than any 
known form ; as these animals combine reptilian characters 
(and in a lesser degree bird character) with mammalian. We 
must imagine some form as intermediate, as is Lepidosiren 
now, between reptiles and fish, between mammals and 
birds on the one hand (for they retain longer the same em- 
bryological character) and reptiles on the other hand. With 
respect to a mammal not being developed on any island, 
besides want of time for so prodigious a development, there 
must have arrived on the island the necessary and peculiar 
progenitor, having a character like the embryo of a mammal ; 
and not an already developed reptile, bird or fish. 

We might give to a bird the habits of a mammal, but 
inheritance would retain almost for eternity some of the bird- 
like structure, and prevent a new creature ranking as a true 
mammal. 

I have often speculated on antiquity of islands, but not 
with your precision, or at all under the point of view of 
Natural Selection not having done what might have been 
anticipated. The argument of littoral Miocene shells at the 
Canary Islands is new to me. I was deeply impressed (from

the amount of the denudation) [with the] antiquity of St. 
Helena, and its age agrees with the peculiarity of the flora. 
With respect to bats at New Zealand (N.B. There are two or 
three European bats in Madeira, and I think in the Canary 
Islands) not having given rise to a group of non-volant bats, 
it is, now you put the case, surprising ; more especially as 
the genus of bats in New Zealand is very peculiar, and there- 
fore has probably been long introduced, and they now speak 
of Cretacean fossils there. But the first necessary step has to 
be shown, namely, of a bat taking to feed on the ground, or 
anyhow, and anywhere, except in the air. I am bound to 
confess I do know one single such fact, viz. of an Indian species 
killing frogs. Observe, that in my wretched Polar Bear case, 
I do show the first step by which conversion into a whale 
“ would be easy,” “ would offer no difficulty ” I ! So with seals, 
I know of no fact showing any the least incipient variation of 
seals feeding on the shore. Moreover, seals wander much ; 
I searched in vain, and could not find otie case of any species 
of seal confined to any islands. And hence wanderers would 
be apt to cross with individuals undergoing any change on an 
island, as in the case of land birds of Madeira and Bermuda. 
The same remark applies even to bats, as they frequently 
come to Bermuda from the mainland, though about 600 miles 
distant. With respect to the Amblyrhynchus of the Gala- 
pagos, one may infer as probable, from marine habits being 
so rare with Saurians, and from the terrestrial species being 
confined to a few central islets, that its progenitor first arrived 
at the Galapagos ; from what country it is impossible to say, 
as its affinity I believe is not very clear to any known species. 
The offspring of the terrestrial species was probably rendered 
marine. Now in this case I do not pretend I can show 
variation in habits ; but we have in the terrestrial species a 
vegetable feeder (in itself a rather unusual circumstance), 
largely on lichens, and it would not be a great change for 
its offspring to feed first on littoral algae and then on sub-

marine algae. I have said what I can in defence, but yours 
is a good line of attack. We should, however, always re- 
member that no change will ever be effected till a variation 
in the habits or structure or of both chance to occur in the 
right direction, so as to give the organism in question an 
advantage over other already established occupants of land 
or water, and this may be in any particular case indefinitely 
long. I am very glad you will read my dogs MS., for it will 
be important to me to see what you think of the balance of 
evidence. After long pondering on a subject it is often 
hard to judge. With hearty thanks for your most interesting 
letter. Farewell.

C. Darwin. 



C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, September and [i860]. 

My dear Hooker, — I am astounded at your news re- 
ceived this morning. I am become such an old fogy that I 
am amazed at your spirit. For God’s sake do not go and get 
your throat cut. Bless my soul, I think you must be a little 
insane. I must confess it will be a most interesting tour ; 
and, if you get to the top of Lebanon, I suppose extremely 
interesting — you ought to collect any beetles under stones 
there ; but the Entomologists are such slow coaches. I 
dare say no result could be made out of them. [They] have 
never worked the Alpines of Britain. 

If you come across any Brine lakes, do attend to their 
minute flora and fauna ; I have often been surprised how 
little this has been attended to. 

I have had a long letter from Lyell, who starts ingenious 
difficulties opposed to Natural Selection, because it has not 
done more than it has. This is very good, as it shows that 
he has thoroughly mastered the subject ; and shows he is in

cockles of my heart.

C. Darwin to Asa Gray. 

Down, Sept. 10 (i860]. 

.... You will be weary of my praise, but it* does strike 
me as quite admirably argued, and so well and pleasantly 
written. Your many metaphors are inimitably good. I said 
in a former letter that you were a lawyer, but I made a gross 
mistake, I am sure that you are a poet No, by Jove, I will 
tell you what you are, a hybrid, a complex cross of lawyer, 
poet, naturalist and theologian ! Was there ever such a 
monster seen before ? 

I have just looked through the passages which I have 
marked as appearing to me extra good, but I see that they 
are too numerous to specify, and this is no exa^eration. My 
eye just alights on the happy comparison of the colours of 
the prism and our artiRcial groups. I see one little error of 
fossil cattle in South America. 

It is curious how each one, I suppose, weighs arguments in 
a different balance : embryology is to me by far the strongest 
single class of facts in favour of change of forms, and not one, 
I think, of my reviewers has alluded to this. Variation not 
coming on at a very early age, and being inherited at not 
a very early corresponding period, explains, as it seems to 
me, the grandest of all facts in natural history, or rather in 
zoology, viz. the resemblance of embryos.

with the heading ‘Natural Selection not inconsistent with 
Natural Theology.’] 



C. Darwin to C. Lytll. 

Down, September 13th [i860]. 

My dear Lyell, — I never thought of showing your letter 
to any one. I mentioned in a letter to Hooker that I had 
been much interested by a letter of yours with original objec 
tions, founded chiefly on Natural Selection not having done 

so much as might have been expected In your letter 

just received, you have improved your case versus Natural 
Selection ; and it would tell with the public (do not be 
tempted by its novelty to make it too strong) ; yet it seems 
to me, not really very killing, though I cannot answer your 
case, especially, why Rodents have not become highly de- 
veloped in Australia. You must assume that they have 
inhabited Australia for a very long period, and this may or 
may not be the case. But I feel that our ignorance is so 
profound, why one form is preserved with nearly the same 
structure, or advances in organisation or even retrogrades, or 
becomes extinct, that I cannot put very great weight on the 
difficulty. Then, as you say often in your letter, we know 
not how many geolc^ical ages it may have taken to make any 
great advance in organisation. Remember monkeys in the 
Eocene formations : but I admit that you have made out an 
excellent objection and difficulty, and I can give only un- 
satisfactory and quite vague answers, such as you have 
yourself put ; however, you hardly put weight enough on 
the absolute necessity of variations first arising in the right 
direction, videlicet, of seals beginning to feed on the shore. 

I entirely agree with what you say about only one species 
of many becoming modified. I remember tliis struck me 
Z 2

THE ‘ORIGIN OF SPECIES.’ 



[i860. 



much when tabulating the varieties of plants, and I have a 
discussion somewhere on this point. It is absolutely implied 
in my ideas of classification and divergence that only one or 
two species, of even large genera, give birth to new species ; 
and many whole genera become ivholly extinct .... Please 
see p. 341 of the ‘Origin.’ But I cannot remember that I 
have stated in the ‘ Origin ’ the fact of only very few species 
in each genus varying. You have put the view much better 
in your letter. Instead of saying as I often have, that very 
few species vary at the same time, I ought to have said, that 
very few species of a genus ever vary so as to become modified ; 
for this is the fundamental explanation of classification, and 
is shown in my engraved diagram. . . . 

I quite agree with you on the strange and inexplicable fact 
of Omithorhynchus having been preserved, and Australian 
Trigonia, or the Silurian Lingula. I always repeat to myself 
that we hardly know why any one single species is rare or 
common in the best-known countries. I have got a set of 
notes somewhere on the inhabitants of fresh water ; and it 
is singular how many of these are ancient, or intermediate 
forms ; which I think is explained by the competition having 
been less severe, and the rate of change of organic forms 
having been slower in small confined areas, such as all the 
fresh waters make compared with sea or land. 

I see that you do allude in the last page, as a difficulty, to 
Marsupials not having become Placentals in Australia ; but 
this I think you have no right at all to e.xpect ; for we ought 
to look at Marsupials and Placentals as having descended 
from some intermediate and lower form. The argument of 
Rodents not having become highly developed in Australia 
(supposing that they have long existed there) is much stronger. 
I grieve to see you hint at the creation “ of distinct successive 
types, as well as of a certain number of distinct aboriginal 
types.” Remember, if you admit this, you give up the em- 
bryological argument (Jhe weightiest of all to me), and the

and your own throat ; and I believe will live to be sorry for it

C. Danoin to C. Lyell. 

15 Marine Parade, Eastbourne, 

Sunday [September 23rd, i860]. 

My dear Lyell, — I got your letter of the i8th just before 
starting here. You speak of saving me trouble in answering 
Never think of this, for I look at every letter of yours as an 
honour and pleasure, which is a pretty deal more than I can 
say of some of the letters which I receive. I have now one 
of 13 closely written folio pages to answer on species ! . . . . 

I have a very decided opinion that all mammals must have 
descended from a single parent. Reflect on the multitude of 
details, very many of them of extremely little importance to 
their habits (as the number of bones of the head, &c., covering 
of hair, identical embryological development, &c. &c.). Now 
this large amount of similarity I must look at as certainly 
due to inheritance from a common stock. I am aware that 
some cases occur in which a similar or nearly similar organ 
has been acquired by independent acts of natural selection. 
But in most of such cases of these apparently so closely 
similar organs, some important homological difference may be 
detected. Please read p. 193, beginning, “ The electric organs,”

342 THE ‘ORIGIN OF SPECIES.’ [i860. 

and trust me that the sentence, “ In all these cases of two very 
distinct species,” 8:c. &c., was not put in rashly, for I went 
carefully into every case. Apply this argument to the whole 
frame, internal and external, of mammifers, and you will see 
why I think so strongly that all have descended from one 
progenitor. I have just re-read your letter, and I am not 
perfectly sure that I understand your point. 

I enclose two diagrams showing the sort of manner I conjec- 
ture that mammals have been developed. I thought a little 
on this when writing page 429, beginning, “ Mr. Waterhouse.” 
(Please read the paragraph.) I have not knowledge enough 
to choose between these hvo diagrams. If the brain of Mar- 
supials in embryo closely resembles that of Placentals, I 
should strongly prefer No. 2, and this agrees with the anti- 
quity of Microlestes. As a general rule I should prefer No. l 
diagram ; whether or not Marsupials have gone on being 
developed, or rising in rank, from a very early period would 
depend on circumstances too complex for even a conjecture. 
Lingula has not risen since the Silurian epoch, whereas other 
molluscs may have risen. 

A, in the following diagrams, represents an unknown form, 
probably Intermediate between Mammals, Reptiles and Birds, 
as intermediate as Lepidosiren now is between Fish and 
Batrachians. This unknown form is probably more closely 
related to Ornithorhynchus than to any other known form. 

I do not think that the multiple origin of dogs goes against 

the single origin of man All the races of man are so 

infinitely closer together than to any ape, that (as in the case 
of descent of all mammals from one progenitor), I should look 
at all races of men as having certainly descended from one 
parent. I should look at it as probable that the races of men 
were less numerous and less divergent formerly than now, 
unless, indeed, some lower and more aberrant race even than 
the Hottentot has become extinct Supposing, as' I do for 
one believe, that our dogs have descended from two or three

wolves, jackals, &c ; yet these have, on our view, descended 
from a single remote unknown progenitor. With domestic 
dogs the question is simply whether the whole amount of 
difference has been produced since man domesticated a single 
species ; or whether part of the difference arises in the state 




of nature. Agassiz and Co. think the negro and Caucasian 
are now distinct species, and it is a mere vain discussion 
whether, when they were rather less distinct, they would, on 
this standard of specific value, deserve to be called species.

1 agree with your answer which you give to yourself on this 
point ; and the simile of man now keeping down any new 
man which might be developed, strikes me as good and new. 
The white man is “ improving off the face of the earth ” even 
races nearly his equals. With respect to islands, I think I would 
trust to want of time alone, and not to bats and rodents. 

N.B. — I know of no rodents on oceanic islands (except my 
Galapagos mouse, which may have been introduced by man) 
keeping down the development of other classes. Still much 
more weight I should attribute to there being now, neither 
in islands nor elsewhere, [any] known animals of a grade of 
organisation intermediate between mammals, fish, reptiles, 
&c., whence a new mammal could be developed. If every 
vertebrate were destroyed throughout the world, except our 
now well-established reptiles, millions of ages might elapse 
before reptiles could become highly developed on a scale 
equal to mammals ; and, on the principle of inheritance, 
they would make some quite new class, and not mammals ; 
though possibly more intellectual ! I have not an idea that 
you will care for this letter, so speculative. 

Most truly yours, 

C. Darwin.

I yet hope and almost believe, that the time will come 
when you will go further, in believing a very large amount of 
modification of species, than you did at first or do now. Can 
you tell me whether you believe further or more firmly than 
you did at first ? I should really like to know this. I can 
perceive in my immense correspondence with Lyell, who 
objected to much at first, that he has, perhaps unconsciously 
to himself, converted himself very much during the last six 
months, and I think this is the case even with Hooker. This 
fact gives me far more confidence than any other fact

meant to write to him and thank him. I suppose Dr. 
Krohn, Bonn, would reach him. 

I cannot see yet how the multiple origin of dog can be 
properly brought as argument for the multiple origin of man. 
Is not your feeling a remnant of the deeply impressed one on 
all our minds, that a species is an entity, something quite dis- 
tinct from a variety ? Is it not that the dog case injures the 
argument from fertility, so that one main argument that the 
races of man are varieties and not species — i.e., because they 
are fertile inter se, is much weakened ? 

I quite agree with what Hooker says, that whatever varia- 
tion is possible under culture, is possible under nature ; not that 
the same form would ever be accumulated and arrived at by 
selection for man’s pleasure, and by natural selection for the 
organism’s own good. 

Talking of “natural selection;’’ if I had to commence de 
novo, I would have used “ natural preservation.” For I find 
men like Harvey of Dublin cannot understand me, though he 
has read the book twice. Dr. Gray of the British Museum 
remarked to me that, “selection was obviously impossible with 
plants I No one could tell him how it could be possible ! ” 
And he may now add that the author did not attempt it to 
him !

is not translated. There are some good hits. He makes an

that I cannot explain why one rat has a longer tail and 
another longer ears, &c. But he seems to muddle in assuming 
that these parts did not all vary together, or one part so 
insensibly before the other, as to be in fact contemporaneous. 
I might ask the creationist whether he thinks these differences 
in the two rats of any use, or as standing in some relation from 
laws of growth ; and if he admits this, selection might come 
into play. He who thinks that God created animals unlike 
for mere sport or variety, as man fashions his clothes, will 
not admit any force in my argumentum ad hominem. 

Bronn blunders about my supposing several Glacial periods, 
whether or no such ever did occur. 

He blunders about my supposing that development goes on 
at the same rate in all parts of the world. I presume that he 
has misunderstood this from the supposed migration into all 
regions of the more dominant forms. 

I have ordered Dr. Bree,* and will lend it to you, if you like, 
and if it turns out good. 

I am very glad that I misunderstood you about 

species not having the capacity to vary, though in fact few do 
give birth to new species. It seems that I am very apt to mis- 
understand you ; I suppose I am always fancying objections. 
Your case of the Red Indian shows me that we agree

THE ‘ORIGIN OF SPECIES.’ 



[i860. 



C. Darwin to J. M. RodwelL* 



15 Marine Parade, Eastbourne. 

November 5th [i8£o]. 

My DEAR Sir, — I am extremely much obliged for your 
letter, which I can compare only to a plum-pudding, so full 
it is of good things. I have been rash about the cats : t yet 
I spoke on what seemed to me, good authority. The Rev. 
W. D. Fox gave me a list of cases of various foreign breeds in 
which he had observed the correlation, and for years he had 
vainly sought an exception. A French paper also gives 
numerous cases, and one very curious case of a kitten which 
gradually lost the blue colour in its eyes and as gradually 
acquired its power of hearing. I had not heard of your uncle, 
Mr. Kirby’s case t (whom I, for as long as I can remember, 
have venerated) of care in breeding cats. I do not know 
whether Mr. Kirby was your uncle by marriage, but your 
letters show me that you ought to have Kirby blood in your 
veins, and that if you had not taken to languages you would 
have been a first-rate naturalist 

I sincerely hope that you will be able to carry out your in- 
tention of writing on the “ Birth, Life, and Death of Words.” 
Anyhow, you have a capital title, and some think this the 
most difficult part of a book. I remember years ago at the 
Cape of Good Hope, Sir J. Herschell saying to me, I wish 
some one would treat language as Lyell has treated geology. 
What a linguist you must be to translate the Koran I Having 
a vilely bad head for languages, I feel an awful respect for 
linguists. 



• Rev. J. M. Rodwell, who was 
at Cambridge with my father, re- 
members him saying ; — “ It strikes 
me that all our knowledge about 
the structure of our earth is very 
much like what an old hen would 
know of a hundred acre field, in a 



comer of which she is scratching.”

I do not know whether my brother-in-law, Hensleigh 
Wedg^vood’s ‘ Etymological Dictionary ’ would be at all in 
your line ; but he treats briefly on the genesis of words ; and, 
as it seems to me, very ingeniously. You kindly say that 
you would communicate any facts which might occur to you, 
and I am sure that I should be most grateful. Of the multi- 
tude of letters which I receive, not one in a thousand is like 
yours in value. 

With my cordial thanks, and apologies for this untidy letter 
written in haste, pray believe me, my dear Sir, 

Yours sincerely obliged, 

Ch. Darwin.

.... I have not had heart to read Phillips* yet, or a 
tremendous long hostile review by Professor Bowen in the 
4to Mem. of the American Academy of Sciences.! (By the 
way, I hear Agassiz is going to thunder against me in the 
next part of the ‘ Contributions.’) Thank you for telling me of 
the sale of the ‘ Origin,’ of which I had not heard. There will 
be some time, I presume, a new edition, and I especially want 
your advice on one point, and you know I think you the 
wisest of men, and I shall be absolutely guided by your advice. 
It has occurred to me, that it would perhaps be a good plan 
to put a set of notes (some twenty to forty or fifty) to the 
‘ Origin,’ which now has none, exclusively devoted to errors 
of my reviewers. It has occurred to me that where a reviewer 
has erred, a common reader might err. Secondly, it will 
show the reader that he must not trust implicitly to reviewers. 
Thirdly, when any special fact has been attacked, I should like

My dear Huxley, — For heaven’s sake don’t write an 
anti-Darwinian article ; you would do it so confoundedly 
well. I have sometimes amused myself with thinking how 
I could best pitch into myself, and I believe I could give two 

or three good digs ; but I will see you first, before I will 

try. I shall be very impatient to see the Review.* If it 
succeeds it may really do much, very much good 

I heard to-day from Murray that I must set to work at 
once on a new edition f of the ‘ Origin.’ [Murray] says the 
Reviews have not improved the sale. I shall always think 
those early reviews, almost entirely yours, did the subject an 
enormous service. If you have any important suggestions or 
criticisms to make on any part of the ‘ Origin,’ I should, of 
course, be very grateful for [them]. For I mean to correct as far 
as I can, but not enlarge. How you must be wearied with 
and hate the subject, and it is God’s blessing if you do not 
get to hate me. Adios.

C. Danvin to C. Lyell. 

Down, November 24th [i860]. 

My dear Lyell, — I thank you much for your letter. I 
had got to take pleasure in thinking how I could best .snub 
my reviewers ; but I was determined, in any case, to follow 
your advice, and, before I had got to the end of your letter, I 
was convinced of the wisdom of your advice.* What an 
advantage it is to me to have such friends as you. I shall 
follow every hint in your letter exactly. 

I have just heard from Murray ; he says he sold ycx) copies 
at his sale, and that he has not half the number to supply ; so 
that I must begin at once. 1 . . . . 



P.S. — I must tell you one little fact which has pleased me. 
You may remember that I adduce electrical organs of fish as 
one of the greatest difficulties which have occurred to me, and 

notices the passage in a singularly disingenuous spirit. 

Well, McDonnell, of Dublin (a first-rate man), writes to me 
that he felt the difficulty of the whole case as overwhelming 
against me. Not only are the fishes which have electric 
organs very remote in scale, but the organ is near the head in 
some, and near the tail in others, and supplied by wholly 
different nerves. It seems impossible that there could be any 
transition. Some friend, who is much opposed to me, seems 
to have crowed over McDonnell, who reports that he said to 
himself, that if Darwin is right, there must be homologous 
organs both near the head and tail in other non-electric fish.

edition. I find that your ^vice

reviews, without any direct notice 
of them, by a little enlargement 
here and there, with here and there

shall treat with the respect of 



giving his objections with his 
name. I think 1 shall improve my 
book a good deal, and add only 
some twenty pages.” — From a

He set to work, and, by Jove, he has found them I* so that 
some of the difficulty is removed ; and is it not satisfactory 
that my hypothetical notions should have led to pretty dis- 
coveries? McDonnell seems very cautious; he says, yea.f^ 
must pass before he will venture to call himself a believer in 
my doctrine, but that on the subjects which he knows well, 
viz. Morphology and Embryology, my views accord well, and 
throw light on the whole subject. 

C. Darwin to Asa Gray. 

Down, November 26th, i860. 

My dear Gray, — I have to thank you for two letters. The 
latter with corrections, written before you received my letter 
asking for an American reprint, and saying that it was 
hopeless to print your reviews as a pamphlet, owing to the 
impossibility of getting pamphlets known. I am very glad 
to say that the August or second ‘Atlantic’ article has been 
reprinted in the ‘Annals and Magazine of Natural History ’ ; 
but I have not yet seen it there. Yesterday I read over with 
care the third article ; and it seems to me, as before, admi- 
rable, But I grieve to say that I cannot honestly go as far 
as you do about Design. I am conscious that I am in an 
utterly hopeless muddle. I cannot think that the world, as 
we see it, is the result of chance ; and yet I cannot look at 
each separate thing as the result of Design. To take a 
crucial example, you lead me to infer (p. 414) that you believe 
“ that variation has been led along certain beneficial lines." I 
cannot believe this ; and I think you would have to believe, 
that the tail of the Fantail was led to vary in the number 
and direction of its feathers in order to gratify the caprice of 
a few men. Yet if the Fantail had been a wild bird, and had

used its abnormal tail for some special end, as to sail before 
the wind, unlike other birds, every one would have said, 
“ What a beautiful and designed adaptation.” Again, I say 
I am, and shall ever remain, in a hopeless muddle. 

Thank you much for Bowen’s 4to. review." The coolness 
with which he makes all animals to be destitute of reason is 
simply absurd. It is monstrous at p. 103, that he should 
argue against the possibility of accumulative variation, and 
actually leave out, entirely, selection I The chance that an 
improved Short-horn, or improved Pouter-pigeon, should 
be produced by accumulative variation without man’s selec- 
tion, is as almost infinity to nothing ; so with natural species 
without natural selection. How capitally in the ‘ Atlantic ’ you 
show that Geology and Astronomy are, according to Bowen, 
Metaphysics ; but he leaves out this in the 4to Memoir. 

I have not much to tell you about my Book. I have just 
heard that Du Bois-Rcymond agrees with me. The sale of my 
book goes on well, and the multitude of reviews has not 
stopped the sale . . . ; so I must begin at once on a new 
corrected edition. I will send you a copy for the chance of 
your ever re-reading ; but, good Heavens, how sick you must 
be of it ! 



C. Darwin to T. H. Huxley. 

Down, Dec. 2nd [i860]. 

.... I have got fairly sick of hostile reviews. Neverthe- 
less, they have been of use in showing me when to expatiate 
a little and to introduce a few new discussions. Of course 
I will send you a copy of the new edition 

I entirely agree with you, that the difficulties on my 
notions are terrific, yet having seen what all the Reviews have 
said against me, I have far more confidence in the general 
truth of the doctrine than I formerly had. Another thing

with me now go further, and some who were bitterly opposed 
are now less bitterly opposed. And this makes me feel a 
little disappointed that you are not inclined to think the 
general view in some slight degree more probable than you 
did at first This I consider rather ominous. Otherwise I 
should be more contented with your degree of belief. I can 
pretty plainly see that, if my view is ever to be generally 
adopted, it will be by young men growing up and replacing 
the old workers, and then young ones finding that they can 
group facts and search out new lines of investigation better 
on the notion of descent, than on that of creation. But 
forgive me for running on so egotistically. Living so solitary 
as I do, one gets to think in a silly manner of one’s own

possible notices in Periodicals.

CHAPTER VIII. 

THE SPREAD OF EVOLUTION. 

1861-1862. 

[The beginning of the year 1861 saw my father with the 
third chapter of ‘The Variation of Animals and Plants’ still 
on his hands. It had been begun in the previous August, 
and was not finished until March 1861. He was, however, for 
part of this time (I believe during December i860 and 
January 1861) engaged in a new edition (3000 copies) of the 
‘ Origin,’ which was largely corrected and added to, and was 
published in April 1861. 

With regard to this, the third edition, he wrote to Mr. Murray 
in December i860: — 

“ I shall be glad to hear when you have decided how many 
copies you will print off— the more the better for me in all 
ways, as far as compatible with safety ; for I hope never again 
to make so many corrections, or rather additions, which I 
have made in hopes of making my many rather stupid 
reviewers at least understand what is meant I hope and 
think I shall improve the book considerably.” 

An interesting feature in the new edition was the ‘‘His- 
torical Sketch of the Recent Prc^ess of Opinion on the Origin 
of Species ” * which now appeared for the first time, and was 
continued in the later editions of the work. It bears a strong

ready appeared in the first German was his critique in the ‘ N. Jahrbuch 
edition (i860) and the American fiir Mineralogie ’ that suggested the 
edition. Bronn states in the Ger- idea of such a sketch to my father.

impress of the author’s personal character in the obvious wish 
to do full justice to all his predecessors, — ^though even in 
this respect it has not escaped some adverse criticism. 

Towards the end of the present year (l86i), the final 
arrangements for the first French edition of the ‘ Origin ’ were 
completed, and in September a copy of the third English 
edition was despatched to Mdlle. CMmence Royer, who under- 
took the work of translation. The book was now spreading 
on the Continent, a Dutch edition had appeared, and, as we 
have seen, a German translation had been published in i860. 
In a letter to Mr. Murray (September 10, 1861), he wrote, 
“ My book seems exciting much attention in Germany, 
judging from the number of discussions sent me.” The 
silence had been broken, and in a few years the voice of 
German science was to become one of the strongest of the 
advocates of evolution. 

During all the early part of the year (1861) he was working 
at the mass of details which are marshalled in order in the early 
chapters of ‘Animals and Plants.’ Thus in his Diary occur 
the laconic entries, “ May 16, Finished Fowls (eight weeks) ; 
May 31, Ducks.” 

On July I, he started, with his family, for Torquay, where 
he remained until August 27 — a holiday which he characteris- 
tically enters in his diary as " eight weeks and a day.” The 
house he occupied was in Hesketh Crescent, a pleasantly 
placed row of houses close above the sea, somewhat removed 
from what was then the main body of the town, and not far 
from the beautiful cliffed coast-line in the neighbourhood of 
Anstey’s Cove. 

During the Torquay holiday, and for the remainder of the 
year, he worked at the fertilisation of orchids. This part of 
the year 1861 is not dealt with in the present chapter, because 
(as explained in the preface) the record of his life, as told in 
his letters, seems to become clearer when the whole of his 
botanical work is placed together and treated separately.

If you come across Dr. Freke on the ‘ Origin of Species by 
means of Organic Affinity,’ read a page here and there. . . .

at only by “ analogy.” I see a Mr. Neale has read a paper 
before the Zoological Society on ‘ Typical Selection what it

that I must more and more husband the very little strength 
which I have. I sometimes suspect I shall soon entirely foil

must try a little water cure. Have you read the ‘ Woman in

mend a book which has interested me greatly, viz. Olmsted’s 
‘Journey in the Back Country.’ It is an admirably lively 
picture of man and slavery in the Southern States

as I think his account is really favourable in a high degree 



“ I wish I had time to write you an account of the lengths 
to which Bowen and Agassiz, each in their own way, are 
going. The first denying all heredity (all transmission except 
specific) whatever. The second coming near to deny that we

and insisting that evidently affiliated languages, e.g. Latin, 
Greek, Sanscrit, owe none of their similarities to a com- 
munity of origin, are all autochthonal ; Agassiz admits that

My dear Hooker, — I was delighted to get your long 
chatty letter, and to hear that you are thawing towards 
science. I almost wish you had remained frozen rather 
longer ; but do not thaw too quickly and strongly. No one 
can work long as you used to do. Be idle ; but I am a 
pretty man to preach, for I cannot be idle, much as I wish it, 
and am never comfortable except when at work. The word 
holiday is written in a dead language for me, and much I 
grieve at it We thank you sincerely for your kind sympathy 

about poor H. [his daughter] She has now come up to 

her old point, and can sometimes get up for an hour or two 
twice a day .... Never to look to the future or as little as 
possible is becoming our rule of life. What a different thing 
life was in youth with no dread in the future ; all golden, if 
baseless, hopes. 

.... With respect to the ‘ Natural History Review ’ I can 
hardly think that ladies would be so very sensitive about 
“ lizards’ guts but the publication is at present certainly 
a sort of hybrid, and original illustrated papers ought hardly 
to appear in a review. I doubt its ever paying ; but I shall 
much regret if it dies. All that you say seems very sensible, 
but could a review in the strict sense of the word be filled 
with readable matter ?

of the ‘Origin,’ and crawling on most slowly with my 
volume of ‘Variation under Domestication.’ .... 

[The following letter refers to Mr. Bates’s paper, “Contri- 
butions to an Insect Fauna of the Amazon Valley,” in the 
‘ Transactions of the Entomological Society.’ vol. 5, N.S.* 
Mr. Ba'-es points out that with the return, after the glacial 
period, of a warmer climate in the equatorial regions, the 
■“ species then living near the equator would retreat north 
and south to their former homes, leaving some of their con- 
geners, slowly modified subsequently ... to re-people the zone 
they had forsaken.” In this case the species now living at 
the equator ought to show clear relationship to the species 
inhabiting the regions about the 25th parallel, whose distant 
relatives they would of course be. But this is not the case, 
and this is the difficulty my father refers to. Mr. Belt has 
offered an explanation in his ‘ Naturalist in Nicaragua ’ 
<1874), p. 266. “ I believe the answer is that there was much 
oxtermination during the glacial period, that many species 
(and some genera, &c., as, for instance, the American horse), 
did not survive it ... . but that a refuge was found for 
many species on lands now below the ocean, that were 
uncovered by the lowering of the sea, caused by the immense 
quantity of water that was locked up in frozen masses on the 
land.”]

My dear Hooker, — I had intended to have sent you 
Bates’s article this very day. I am so glad you like it. I have 
been extremely much struck with it. How well he argues, 
and with what crushing force against the glacial doctrine. 
I cannot wriggle out of it : I am dumbfounded ; yet I do 
believe that some explanation some day will appear, and I

harmonises with so much. When you -write (and much in-

are generally uniform in generic character from 0° to

Before reading Bates, I had become thoroughly dissatisfled 
with what I wrote to you. I hope you may get Bates to 
write in the ‘ Linnean.’ 

Here is a good joke : H. C. Watson (who, I fancy and hope, 
is going to review the new edition * of the ‘ Origin ’) says that 
in the first four paragraphs of the introduction, the words “ I,"' 
“ me,” “ my,” occur forty-three times 1 I was dimly conscious 
of the accursed fact He says it can be explained phreno- 
logically, which I suppose civilly means, that I am the most 
egotistically self-sufficient man alive ; perhaps so. I wonder 
whether he will print this pleasing fact ; it beats hollow the 
parentheses in Wollaston’s writing.

doctrine must sink or swim according as it groups and 
explains phenomena. It is really curious how few judge it in 
this way, which is clearly the right way. I have been much

interested by Bentham’s paper* in the N. H. R., but it 
would not, of course, from familiarity, strike you as it did me. 
I liked the whole ; all the facts on the nature of close and 
varying species. Good Heavens! to think of the British 
botanists turning up their noses, and saying that he knows 
nothing of British plants 1 I was also pleased at his remarks 
on classification, because it showed me that I wrote truly on 
this subject in the ‘ Origin.’ I saw Bcntham at the Linnean 
Society, and had some talk with him and Lubbock, and 
Edgeworth, Wallich, and several others. I asked Bentham 
to give us his ideas of species ; whether partially with us or 
dead against us, he would write excellent matter. He made 
no answer, but his manner made me think he might do so if 
urged ; so do you attack him. Every one was speaking with 
affection and anxiety of Henslow.f I dined with Bell at the 
Linnean Club, and liked my dinner. .... Dining out is. 
such a novelty to me that I enjoyed it. Bell has a real good 
heart. I liked Rolleston's paper, but I never read anything 
so obscure and not self-evident as his ‘ Canons.’ t ... . I 
called on R. Chambers, at his very nice house in St John’s. 
Wood, and had a very pleasant half-hour’s talk ; he is really 
a capital fellow. He made one good remark and chuckled 
over it, that the laymen universally had treated the contro-

am (stomacho volente) coming up to London on Tuesday to

funereal ceremonies of the ants, notwithstanding that Erasmus 
has often told me that I should find some day that they have 
their bishops. After a battle I have always seen the ants 
carry away the dead for food. Ants display the utmost 
economy, and always carry away a dead fellow-creature as 
food. But I have just fonvarded two most extraordinary 
letters to Busk, from a backwoodsman in Texas, who has evi- 
dently watched ants carefully, and declares most positively 
that they plant and cultivate a kind of grass for store food, 
and plant other bushes for shelter ! I do not know what to 
think, except that the old gentleman is not fibbing inten-

C. Darwin to Thomas Davidson* 

Down, April 26, 1861. 

My dear Sir, — I hope that you will excuse me for ven- 
turing to make a suggestion to you which I am perfectly well 
aware it is a very remote chance that you would adopt I do 
not know whether you have read my ‘ Origin of Species ’ ; in 
that book I have made the remark, which I apprehend will 
be universally admitted, that ' as a whole, the fauna of any 
formation is intermediate in character bebveen that of the 
formations above and below. But several really good judges 
have remarked to me how desirable it would be that this 
should be exemplified and worked out in some detail 
and with some single group of beings. Now every one will 
admit that no one in the world could do this better than you 
with Brachiopods. The result might turn out very unfavour- 
able to the views which I hold ; if so, so much the better for 
those who are opposed to me.f But I am inclined to suspect 
that on the whole it would be favourable to the notion of

■Spirifers, &c., from three palaeozoic stages, and arranged them 
in single and branching lines, with horizontal lines marking 
the formations (like the diagram in my book, if you know 
it), and the result seemed to me very striking, though I was 
too ignorant fully to appreciate the lines of affinities. I 
longed to have had these shells engraved, as arranged by 
Mr. Salter, and connected by dotted lines, and would have 
gladly paid the expense : but I could not persuade Mr. Salter 
to publish a little paper on the subject. I can hardly doubt 
that many curious points would occur to any one thoroughly 
instructed in the subject, who would consider a group of 
beings under this point of view of descent with modihcation. 
All those forms which have come down from an ancient 
period very slightly modified ought, I think, to be omitted, 
and those forms alone considered which have undergone 
considerable change at each successive epoch. My fear is 
whether brachiopods have changed enough. The absolute 
amount of difference of the forms in such groups at the 
opposite extremes of time ought to be considered, and how 
far the early forms are intermediate in character between 
those which appeared much later in time. The antiquity of 
a group is not really diminished, as some seem vaguely to 
think, because it has transmitted to the present day closely 
allied forms. Another point is how far the succession of each 
genus is unbroken, from the first time it appeared to its 
extinction, with due allowance made for formations poor in 
fossils. I cannot but think that an important essay (far more 
important than a hundred literary reviews) might be written 
by one like yourself, and without very great labour. I know 
it is highly probable that you may not have leisure, or not 
care for, or dislike the subject, but I trust to your kindness 
to forgive me for making this suggestion. If by any extra- 
ordinary good fortune you were inclined to take up this 
notion, I would ask you to read my Chapter X. on Geo- 
logical Succession. And I should like in this case to be

C. Darwin to Thomas Davidson. 

Down, April 30, 1S61. 

My dear Sir, — I thank you warmly for your letter ; I did 
not in the least know that you had attended to my work. I 
assure you that the attention which you have paid to it, con- 
sidering your knowledge and the philosophical tone of your 
mind (for I well remember one remarkable letter you wrote 
to me, and have looked through your various publications), 
I consider one of the highest, perhaps the very highest, com- 
pliments which I have received. I live so solitary a life that 
I do not often hear what goes on, and I should much like to 
know in what work you have published some remarks on my 
book. I take a deep interest in the subject, and I hope not 
simply an egotistical interest ; therefore you may believe how 
much your letter has gratified me ; I am perfectly contented 
if any one will fairly consider the subject, whether or not he 
fully or only very slightly agrees with me. Pray do not 
think that I feel the least surprise at your demurring to a 
ready acceptance ; in fact, I should not much respect anyone’s 
judgment who did so : that is, if I may judge others from 
the long time which it has taken me to go round. Each 
stage of belief cost me years. The difficulties are, as you say, 
many and very great ; but the more I reflect, the more they 
seem to me to be due to our underestimating our Igpiorance. 
I belong so much to old times that I find that I weigh

the difficulties from the imperfection of the geological 
record, heavier than some of the younger men. I find, to 
my astonishment and joy, that such good men as Ramsay, 
Jukes, Geikie, and one old worker, Lyell, do not think that 
I have in the least exaggerated the imperfection of the 
record.* If my views ever are proved true, our current geo- 
logical views will have to be considerably modified. My 
greatest trouble is, not being able to weigh the direct effects 
of the long-continued action of changed conditions of life 
without any selection, with the action of selection on mere 
accidental (so to speak) variability. I oscillate much on this 
head, but generally return to my belief that the direct action 
of the conditions of life have not been great. At least 
this direct action can have played an extremely small part 
in producing all the numberless and beautiful adaptations in 
every living creature. With respect to a person’s belief, what 
does rather surprise me is that any one (like Carpenter) 
should bo willing to go so very far as to believe that all birds 
may have descended from one parent, and not go a little 
farther and include all the members of the same great division ; 
for on such a scale of belief, all the facts in Morphology and 
in Embryology (the most important in my opinion of all sub- 
jects) become mere Divine mockeries I cannot express 

how profoundly glad I am that some day you will publish 
your theoretical view on the modification and endurance of

part of the ‘Origin of Species’ 
very diflerently, as might have 
been expected from his vehement

Sedgwick wrote: “We know the 
complicated organic phenomena of

Brachiopodous species ; I am sure it will be a most valuable 
contribution to knowledge. 

Pray forgive this very egotistical letter, but you yourself 
arc partly to blame for having pleased me so much. I have 
told Murray to send a copy of my new edition to you, and 
have written your name. 

With cordial thanks, pray believe me, my dear Sir, 

Yours very sincerely, 

Ch. Darwin. 

[In Mr. Davidson’s Monograph on British Brachiopoda^ 
published shortly afterwards by the Falxontographical Society, 
results such as my father anticipated were to some extent 
obtained. “No less than fifteen commonly received species- 
are demonstrated by Mr. Davidson by the aid of a long series 
of transitional forms to appertain to . . . one type.” * 

In the autumn of i860, and the early part of 1861, my 
father had a good deal of correspondence with Professor 
Asa Gray on a subject to which reference has already been 
made — the publication, in the form of a pamphlet, of Pro- 
fessor Gray’s three articles in the July, August, and October 
numbers of the ‘Atlantic Monthly,’ i860. The pamphlet was 
published by Messrs. Triibner, with reference to whom my 
father wrote, “ Messrs. Triibner have been most liberal and 
kind, and say they shall make no charge for all their trouble. 
I have settled about a few advertisements, and they will 
gratuitously insert one in their own periodicals.” 

The reader will find these articles republished in Dr. Gray’s 
‘ Darwiniana,’ p. 87, under the title “Natural Selection not 
inconsistent with Natural Theology.” The pamphlet found 
many admirers among those most capable of judging of its 
merits, and my father believed that it was of much value in 
lessening opposition, and making converts to Evolution. His.

l86l.] DR. gray’s pamphlet — DESCENT THEORY. 37I 

high opinion of it is shown not only in his letters, but by the 
fact that he inserted a special notice of it in a most prominent 
place in the third edition of the ‘Origin.’ Lyell, among 
others, recognised its value as an antidote to the kind of 
criticism from which the cause of Evolution suffered. Thus 
my father wrote to Dr. Gray; — ^“Just to exemplify the use 
of your pamphlet, the Bishop of London was asking Lyell 
what he thought of the review in the ‘ Quarterly,’ and Lyell 
answered, * Read Asa Gray in the ‘Atlantic.’ ” It comes out 
very clearly that in the case of such publications as Dr. Gray’s, 
my father did not rejoice over the success of his special view 
of Evolution, viz. that modification is mainly due to Natural 
Selection ; on the contrary, he felt strongly that the really 
important point was that the doctrine of Descent should be 
accepted. Thus he wrote to Professor Gray (May ll, 1863), 
with reference to Lyell’s ‘ Antiquity of Man ’ : — 

“ You speak of Lyell as a judge ; now what I complain of 
is that he declines to be a judge .... I have sometimes 
almost wished that Lyell had pronounced against me. When 
I say ‘ me,’ I only mean change of species by descent. That 
seems to me the turning-point Personally, of course, I care 
much about Natural Selection ; hut that seems to me utterly 
unimportant, compared to the question of Creation or Modifi-

I am expecting mine, which I will send off as soon as it

with the photographer. .... Since writing last, I have had 
several letters full of the highest commendation of your Essay ;

doubt it has done the ‘ Origin ’ much good. I have not yet

Gardener^ Chronicle. Poor dear Henslow, to whom I owe 
much, is dying, and Hooker is with him. Many thanks for 
two sets of sheets of your Proceedings. I cannot understand 
what Agassiz is driving at. You once spoke, I think, of 
Professor Bowen as a very clever man. I should have thought 
him a singularly unobservant man from his writings. He 
never can have seen much of animals, or he would have seen 
the difference of old and wise dogs and young ones. His 
paper about hereditariness beats everything. Tell a breeder 
that he might pick out his worst individual animals and 
breed from them, and hope to win a prize, and he would think 
you . . . insane. 

[Professor Henslow died on May l6, i86i, from a complica- 
tion of bronchitis, congestion of the lungs, and enlargement 
of the heart. His strong constitution was slow in giving way, 
and he lingered for weeks in a painful condition of weakness, 
knowing that his end was near, and looking at death with 
fearless eyes. In Mr. Blomefield’s (Jenyns) ‘Memoir of 
Henslow’ (1862) is a dignified and touching description of 
Prof. Sedgwick’s farewell visit to his old friend. Sedg\vick 
said afterwards that he had never seen “a human being 
whose soul was nearer heaven.” 

My father wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker on hearing of Henslow’s 
death, “ I fully believe a better man never walked this earth.” 

He gave his impressions of Henslow’s character in Mr. 
Blomefield’s ‘ Memoir.’ In reference to these recollections he 
wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker (May 30, 1861) : — 

“ This morning I wrote my recollections and impressions of 
character of poor dear Henslow about the year 1830. I liked 
the job, and so have written four or five pages, now being 
copied. I do not suppose you will use all, of course you can 
chop and change as much as you like. If more than a sen- 
tence is used, I should like to see a proof-page, as I never 
can write decently till I see it in print Very likely some of 
my remarks may appear too trifling, but I thought it best to

give my thoughts as they arose, for you or Jenyns to use as 
you think fit. 

“ You will see that I have exceeded your request, but, as I 
said when I began, I took, pleasure in writing my impression 
of his admirable character."] 



C. Darwin to Asa Gray. 

Down, June 5 [1861]. 

My dear Gray, — I have been rather extra busy, so have 
been slack in answering your note of May 6th. I hope you 
have received long ago the third edition of the ‘ Origin.’ .... 
I have heard nothing from Triibner of the sale of your Essay, 
hence fear it has not been great ; I wrote to say you could 
supply more. I sent a copy to Sir J. Herschel, and in his 
new edition of his ’ Physical Geography ’ he has a note on 
the ‘ Origin of Species,’ and agrees, to a certain limited extent, 

but puts in a caution on design — much like yours 

I have been led to think more on this subject of late, and 
grieve to say that I come to differ more from you. It is not 
that designed variation makes, as it seems to me, my deity 
“ Natural Selection ’’ superfluous, but rather from studying, 
lately, domestic variation, and seeing what an enormous field 
of undesigned variability there is ready for natural selection 
to appropriate for any purpose useful to each creature. 

I thank you much for sending me your review of Phillips.* 
I remember once telling you a lot of trades which you ought 
to have followed, but now I am convinced that you are a bom 
reviewer. By Jove, how well and often you hit the nail on 
the head I You rank Phillips’s book higher than I do, or than 
Lyell does, who thinks it fearfully retrograde. I amused 
myself by parodying Phillips’s argument as applied to do- 
mestic variation ; and you might thus prove that the duck or

brought back with me a live Proteus anguinus, designed for 
you from the moment I got it ; ije. if you have got an 
aquarium and would care to have it. I only returned last 
night from the Continent, and hearing from your brother that 
you are about to go to Torquay, I lose no time in making 
you the offer. The poor dear animal is still alive — although 
it has had no appreciable means of sustenance for a month — 
and I am most anxious to get rid of the responsibility of 
starving it longer. In your hands it will thrive and have a 
fair chance of being developed without delay into some type 
of the Columbidse — say a Pouter or a Tumbler.

and 29th, and Sept 2nd received this morning. I agree with 
much of what you say, and I hope to God we English are 
utterly wrong in doubting (i) whether the N. can conquer 
the S. ; (2) whether the N. has many friends in the South, and 
(3) whether you noble men of Massachusetts are right in 
transferring your own good feelings to the men of Washing- 
ton. Again I say I hope to God we are wrong in doubting 
on these points. It is number (3) which alone causes Eng- 
land not to be enthusiastic with you. What it may be in 
Lancashire I know not, but in S. England cotton has nothing 
whatever to do with our doubts. If abolition does follow 
with your victory, the whole world will look brighter in my 
eyes, and in many eyes. It would be a great gain even to 
stop the spread of slavery into the Territories ; if that be 
possible without abolition, which I should have doubted. 
You ought not to wonder so much at England’s coldness, 
when you recollect at the commencement of the war how 
many propositions were made to get things back to the old 
state with the old line of latitude. But enough of this, all 
I can say is that Massachusetts and the adjoining States 
have the full sympathy of every good man whom I see ; 
and this sympathy would be extended to the whole Federal 
States, if we could be persuaded that your feelings were at 
all common to them. But enough of this. It is out of my 
line, though I read every word of news, and formerly 
well studied Olmsted 

Your question what would convince me of Design is a 
poser. If I saw an angel come down to teach us good, and I 
was convinced from others seeing him that I was not mad, I 
should believe in design. If I could be convinced thoroughly 
that life and mind was in an unknown way a function of other 
imponderable force, I should be convinced. If man was 
made of brass or iron and no way connected with any other 
organism which had ever lived, I should perhaps be con- 
vinced. But this is childish writing.

I have lately been corresponding with Lyell, who, I think, 
adopts your idea of the stream of variation having been led 
or designed. I have asked him (and he says he will hereafter 
reflect and answer me) whether he believes that the shape of 
my nose was designed. If he does I have nothing more to 
say. If not, seeing what Fanciers have done by selecting 
individual differences in the nasal bones of pigeons, I must 
think that it is illogical to suppose that the variations, which 
natural selection preserves for the good of any being, have 
been designed. But I know that I am in the same sort of 
muddle (as I have said before) as all the world seems to be

have been foreseen or pre-ordained.

C. Darwin to H W. Bates. 

Down, Dec. 3 [i86i]. 

My dear Sir. — I thank you for your extremely interesting 
letter, and valuable references, though God knows when I 
shall come again to this part of my subject. One cannot of 
•course judge of style when one merely hears a paper,* but 
yours seemed to me very clear and good. Believe me that I 
estimate its value most highly. Under a general point of view, 
I am quite convinced (Hooker and Huxley took the same 
view some months ago) that a philosophic view of nature can

that the Linncan Society will give plates if you can get 
drawings. . . . 

Do not complain of want of advice during your travels ; I 
dare say part of your great originality of views may be due to 
the necessity of self-exertion of thought. I can understand 
that your reception at the British Museum would damp 
you ; they are a very good set of men, but not the sort to 
appreciate your work. In fact I have long thought that 
too much systematic work [and] description somehow blunts 
the faculties. The general public appreciates a good dose of 
reasoning, or generalisation, with new and curious remarks 
on habits, final causes, &c. &c., far more than do the regular 
naturalists. 

I am extremely glad to hear that you have begun your 
travels ... I am very busy, but I shall be truly glad to 
render any aid which I can by reading your first chapter or 
two. I do not think I shall be able to correct style, for this 
reason, that after repeated trials I find I cannot correct my 
own style till I see the MS. in type. Some are born with a 
power of good writing, like Wallace ; others like myself and 
Lyell have to labour very hard and slowly at every sentence. 
I find it a very good plan, when I cannot get a difficult 
discussion to please me, to fancy that some one comes into 
the room and asks me what I am doing ; and then try at 
once and explain to the imaginary person what it is all 
about. I have done this for one paragraph to myself several 
times, and sometimes to Mrs. Danvin, till I see how the 
subject ought to go. It is, I think, good to read one’s MS. 
aloud. But style to me is a great difficulty ; yet some good 
Judges think I have succeeded, and I say this to encourage 

What / think I can do will be to tell you whether parts

public appreciate monkeys — our poor cousins. What sexual 
differences are there in monkeys? Have you kept them 
tame? if so, about their expression. I fear that you will 
hardly read my vile hand-writing, but I cannot without killing 
trouble write better. 

You shall have my candid opinion on your MS., but 
remember it is hard to judge from MS., one reads slowly, and 
heavy parts seem much heavier. A first-rate judge thought 
my Journal very poor ; now that it is in print, I happen to 
know, he likes it I am sure you will understand why I am 
so egotistical. 

I was a little disappointed in Wallace’s book * on the 
Amazon ; hardly facts enough. On other hand, in Gosse’s 
book t there is not reasoning enough to my taste. Heaven 
knows whether you will care to read all this scribbling. . . . 

I am glad you had a pleasant day with Hooker,^ he is an 
admirably good man in every sense. 

[The following extract from a letter to Mr. Bates on the 
same subject is interesting as giving an idea of the plan 
followed by my father in writing his ‘ Naturalist’s Voyage : ’ 

“ As an old hackneyed author, let me give you a bit of 
advice, viz. to strike out every word which is not quite 
necessary to the current subject, and which could not interest 
a stranger. I constantly asked myself. Would a stranger 
care for this ? and struck out or left in accordingly. I think 
too much pains cannot be taken in making the style trans- 
parently clear and throwing eloquence to the dogs.”

published in 1863, but the following letter may be given here 
rather than in its due chronological position : ]

Dear Bates, — I have finished vol. i. My criticisms may 
be condensed into a single sentence, namely, that it is the 
best work of Natural History Travels ever published in 
England. Your style seems to me admirable. Nothing can 
be better than the discussion on the struggle for existence, 
and nothing better than the description of the Forest 
scenery.* It is a grand book, and whether or not it sells 
quickly, it will last. You have spoken out boldly on Species ; 
and boldness on the subject seems to get rarer and rarer. 
How beautifully illustrated it is. The cut on the back is 
most tasteful. I heartily congratulate you on its publication.

patriots, to hate each other, though I shall find this hating

side of slavery. No doubt it will be said that we fight to get 
cotton ; but I fully believe that this has not entered into the 
motive in the least Well, thank Heaven, we private indi- 
viduals have nothing to do with so awful a responsibility. 
Again, how curious it is that you seem to think that you can 
conquer the South ; and I never meet a soul, even those who 
would most wish it, who thinks it possible — ^that is, to conquer 
and retain it I do not suppose the mass of people in your 
country will believe it but I feel sure if we do go to war it 
will be with the utmost reluctance by all classes. Ministers of 
Government and all. Time will show, and it is no use writing 
or thinking about it I called the other day on Dr. Boott, 
and was pleased to find him pretty well and cheerful. I see, 
by the way, he takes quite an English opinion of American 
affairs, though an American in heart.f Buckle might write 
a chapter on opinion being entirely dependent on longitude ! 

. . . With respect to Design, I feel more inclined to show 
a white flag than to fire my usual long-range shot I like to 
try and ask you a puzzling question, but when you return the 
compliment I have great doubts whether it is a fair way of 
arguing. If anything is designed, certainly man must be: 
one’s “ inner consciousness ” (though a false guide) tells one 
so ; yet I cannot admit that man’s rudimentary mamms . . , 
were designed. If I was to say I believed this, I should 
believe it in the same incredible manner as the orthodox 
believe the Trinity in Unity. You say that you are in a 
haze ; I am in thick mud ; the orthodox would say in fetid, 
abominable mud ; yet I cannot keep out of the question. 
My dear Gray, I have written a deal of nonsense. 

Yours most cordially, 

C. Darwin.

[Owing to the illness from scarlet fever of one of his boys, 
he took a house at Bournemouth in the autumn. He wrote- 
to Dr. Gray from Southampton (Aug. 21, 1862) : — 

“We are a wretched family, and ought to be exterminated. 
We slept here to rest our poor boy on his journey to Bourne- 
mouth, and my poor dear wife sickened with scarlet fever, 
and has had it pretty sharply, but is recovering well. There 
is no end of trouble in this weary world. I shall not feel safe 
till we are all at home together, and when that will be I know 
not. But it is foolish complaining.” 

Dr. Gray used to send postage stamps to the scarlet fever 
patient ; with regard to this good-natured deed my father 
wrote — 

“ I must just recur to stamps ; my little man has calculated 
that he will now have 6 stamps which no other boy in the 
school has. Here is a triumph. Your last letter was 
plaistered with many coloured stamps, and he long surveyed 
the envelope in bed with much quiet satisfaction.” 

The greater number of the letters of 1862 deal with the 
Orchid work, but the wave of conversion to Evolution was 
still spreading, and reviews and letters bearing on the subject 
still came in numbers. As an example of the odd letters 
he received may be mentioned one which arrived in January 
of this year “ from a German homoeopathic doctor, an ardent 
admirer of the ‘Origin.’ Had himself published nearly 
the same sort of book, but goes much deeper. Explains 
the origin of plants and animals on the principles of ho- 
moeopathy or by the law of spirality. Book fell dead in 
Germany. Therefore would I translate it and publish it in

you have attacked Bigotry in its stronghold. I thought you 
would have been mobbed. I am so glad that you will 
publish your Lectures. You seem to have kept a due medium 
between extreme boldness and caution. I am heartily glad 
that all went off so well I hope Mrs. Huxley is pretty well. 
.... I must say one word on the Hybrid que.stion. No 
doubt you are right that here is a great hiatus in the argu- 
ment ; yet I think you overrate it — you never allude to the 
excellent evidence of varieties of Verbascum and Nicotiana 
being partially sterile together. It is curious to me to read 
(as I have to-day) the greatest crossing Gardener utterly 
pooh-poohing the distinction which Botanists make on this 
head, and insisting how frequently crossed varieties produce 
sterile offspring. Do oblige me by reading the latter half of 
my Primula paper in the ‘ Linn. Journal,’ for it leads me to 
suspect that sterility will hereafter have to be largely viewed 
as an acquired or selected character — a view which I wish I 
bad had facts to maintain in the ‘ Origin.’ f. . . .

tjuite turned my stomach, that I almost thought it would be 
good for the peace of the world if the United States were

of making a line of .separation were fearful. I wonder what 

he will say Your notion of the Aristocrat being ken- 

speckle, and the best men of a good lot being thus easily 
selected is new to me, and striking. The ‘ Origin ’ having made 
you in fact a jolly old Tory, made us all laugh heartily. I 
have sometimes speculated on this subject ; primogeniture* is 
dreadfully opposed to selection ; suppo.se the first-born bull 
was necessarily made by each farmer the begetter of his 
stock ! On the other hand, as you say, ablest men arc con- 
tinually raised to the peerage, and get crossed with the older

beautiful and charming women out of the lower ranks ; so 
that a good deal of indirect selection improves the Lords.

wingless birds had lost their wings by disuse, also that 
magpies stole spoons, &c., from a remnant of some instinct 
like that of the Bower-Bird, which ornaments its playing- 
passage with pretty feathers. Indeed, I am told that he 
hinted plainly that all birds are descended from one .... 

Your P.S. touches on, as it seems to me, very difficult 
points. I am glad to see [that] in the ‘ Origin,’ I only say 
that the naturalists generally consider that low organisms 
vary more than high ; and this I think certainly is the 
general opinion. I put the statement this way to show that 
I considered it only an opinion probably true. I must own 
that I do not at all trust even Hooker’s contrary opinion, as 
I feel pretty sure that he has not tabulated any result I 
have some materials at home, I think I attempted to make 
this point out, but cannot remember the result 

Mere variability, though the necessary foundation of all 
modifications, I believe to be almost always present, enough 
to allow of any amount of selected change ; so that it docs 
not seem to me at all incompatible that a group which at any 
one period (or during all successive periods) varies less, should 
in the long course of time have undergone more modification 
than a group which is generally more variable. 

Placental animals, c.g. might be at each period less variable 
than Marsupials, and nevertheless have undergone more 
differentiation and development than marsupials, owing to 
some advantage, probably brain development. 

I am surprised, but do not pretend to form an opinion at 
Hooker’s statement that higher species, genera, &c., are best 
limited. It seems to me a bold statement. 

Looking to the ‘ Origin,’ I see that I state that the pro- 
ductions of the land seem to change quicker than those of 
the sea (Chapter X., p. 339, 3rd edition), and 1 add there is 
some reason to believe that organisms considered high in the 
scale change quicker than those that are low. I remember 
writing these sentences after much deliberation I

.... I found here * a short and very kind note of Fal- 
coner, with some pages of his ‘ Elephant Memoir,’ which will 
be published, in which he treats admirably on long persistence 
of type. I thought he was going to make a good and crush- 
ing attack on me, but, to my great satisfaction, he ends by 
pointing out a loophole, and adds,f "with him I have no faith 
that the mammoth and other extinct elephants made their 
appearance suddenly. .... The most rational view seems 
to be that they are the modified descendants of earlier pro- 
genitors. &c.” This is capital. There will not be soon one 
good palaeontologist who believes in immutability. Falconer 
does not allow for the Proboscidean group being a failing one, 
and therefore not likely to be giving off new races. 

He adds that he does not think Natural Selection suffices. 
I do not quite see the force of his argument, and he appa- 
rently overlooks that I say over and over again that Natural 
Selection can do nothing without variability, and that varia- 
bility is subject to the most comple.x fixed laws

year, are occasional notes on the progress of the ‘ Variation 
of Animals and Plants.’ Thus on November 24th he wrote : 
" I hardly know why I am a little sorry, but my present 
work is leading me to believe rather more direct in the action 
of physical conditions. I presume I regret it, because it 
lessens the glory of Natural Selection, and is so confoundedly 
doubtful. Perhaps I shall change again when I get all my 
facts under one point of view, and a pretty hard job this 
will be.” 

Again, on December 22nd, “To-day I have begun to 
think of arranging my concluding chapters on Inheritance, 
Reversion, Selection, and such things, and am fairly paralysed 
how to begin and how to end, and what to do, with my huge

admirable papers I ever read in my life. The mimetic cases 
are truly marvellous, and you connect excellently a host of 
analogous facts. The illustrations are beautiful, and seem 
very well chosen ; but it would have saved the reader not a 
little trouble, if the name of each had been engraved below 
each separate figure. No doubt this would have put the 
engraver into fits, as it would have destroyed the beauty of the 
plate. I am not at all surprised at such a paper having con- 
sumed much time. I am rejoiced that I passed over the 
whole subject in the ‘ Origin,’ for I should have made a pre- 
cious mess of it. You have most clearly stated and solved 
a wonderful problem. No doubt with most jjeople this will 
be the cream of the paper ; but I am not sure that all your 
facts and reasonings on variation, and on the segregation of 
complete and semi-complete species, is not really more, or 
at least as valuable, a part. I never conceived the process 
nearly so clearly before ; one feels present at the creation of 
new forms. I wish, however, you had enlarged a little more 
on the pairing of similar varieties; a rather more numerous 
body of facts seems here wanted. Then, again, what a host 
of curious miscellaneous observations there arc — as on related 



varieties of one species ; other mi- 
mickers are undoubtedly distinct 
species, or even distinct genera. 
So again, some of the mimicked 
forms can be shown to be merely 
varieties ; but the greater number 
must be ranked as distinct species. 
Hence the creationist will have to 
admit that some of these forms 
have become imitators, by means 
of the laws of variation, whilst 
others he must look at as separately 
created under their present guise ; 
he will further have to admit that 
some have been created in imita- 
tion of forms not themselves created 
as we now see them, but due to the 



laws of variation! Prof. Agassiz, 
indeed, would think nothing of this 
difficulty ; for he believes that not 
only each species and each variety, 
but that groups of individuals, 
though identically the same, when 
inhabiting distinct countries, have 
been all separately created in due 
proportional numbers to the wants 
of each land. Not many natur- 

lieve that varieties and individuals 
have been turned out all ready 
made, almost as a manufacturer 
turns out toys according to the 
temporary demand of the market”

sexual and individual variability : these will some day, if I 
live, be a treasure to me. 

With respect to mimetic resemblance being so common 
with insects, do you not think it may be connected with their 
small size ; they cannot defend themselves ; they cannot 
escape by flight, at least, from birds, therefore they escape 
by trickery and deception ? 

I have one serious criticism to make, and that is about the 
title of the paper ; I cannot but think that you ought to have 
called prominent attention in it to the mimetic resemblances. 
Your paper is too good to be largely appreciated by the mob 
of naturalists without souls ; but, rely on it, that it will have 
lasting value, and I cordially congratulate you on your first 
great work. You will find, I should think, that Wallace will 
fully appreciate it How gets on your book ? Keep your 
spirits up. A book is no light labour. I have been better 
lately, and working hard, but my health is very indifferent 
How is your health ? Believe me, dear Bates, 

Yours very sincerely, 

C. Darwin.

CHAPTER I. 

THE SPREAD OF EVOLUTION. 

‘VARIATION OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS.’ 
1863-1866. 

His book on animals and plants under domestication was my 
father’s chief employment in the year 1863. His diary 
records the length of time spent over the composition of its 
chapters, and shows the rate at which he arranged and wrote 
out for printing the observations and deductions of several 
years. 

The three chapters in vol. ii. on inheritance, which occupy 
84 pages of print, were begun in January and finished on 
April 1st ; the five on crossing, making 106 pages, were written 
in eight weeks, while the two chapters on selection, covering 
57 pages, were begun on June 16th and finished on July 20th. 

The work was more than once interrupted by ill-health, 
and, in September, what proved to be tl>e beginning of a six 
months’ illness forced him to leave home for the water-cure 
at Malvern. He returned in October, and remained ill and 
depressed, in spite of the hopeful opinion of one of the most 
cheery and skilful physicians of the day. Thus he wrote to 
Sir J. D. Hooker in November : — 

“ Dr. Brinton has been here (recommended by Busk) ; he

does not believe my brain or heart are primarily affected, but I 
have been so steadily going downhill, I cannot help doubting 
whether I can ever crawl a little uphill again. Unless I can, 
enough to work a little, I hope my life may be very short, 
for to lie on a sofa all day and do nothing but give trouble to 
the best and kindest of wives and good dear children is 
dreadful.” 

The minor works in this year were a short paper in the 
‘ Natural History Review ’ (N.S. vol. iii. p. 1 1 5), entitled “ On 
the so-called Auditory-Sac of Cirripedes,” and one in the 
‘ Geological Society’s Journal ’ (vol. xix.), on the “ Thickness of 
the Pampjean Formation near Buenos Ayres.” The paper 
on Cirripedes was called forth by the criticisms of a German 
naturalist Krohn,* and is of some interest in illustration of my 
father's readiness to admit an error. 

With regard to the spread of a belief in Evolution, it could 
not yet be said that the battle was won, but the growth of 
belief was undoubtedly rapid. So that, for instance, Charles 
Kingsley could write to F. D. Maurice : — f 

“ The state of the scientific mind is most curious ; Darwin 
is conquering everywhere, and rushing in like a flood, by the 
mere force of truth and fact” 

Mr. Huxley was as usual active in guiding and stimulating 
the growing tendency to tolerate or accept the views set forth 
in the ‘ Origin of Species.’ He gave a series of lectures to 
working men at the School of Mines in November, 1862. 
These were printed in 1863 from the shorthand notes of Mr. 
May, as six little blue books, price 4 d. each, under the title, 
‘ Our Knowledge of the Causes of Organic Nature.’ When 
published they were read with interest by my father, who thus 
refers to them in a letter to Sir J. D. Hooker : — 

* Krohn stated that thestructures orifice described in the ‘Mono- 
described by my father as ovaries graph of the Cirripedia ’ as the 
were in reality salivary glands, also auditory meatus. 
that the oviduct runs down to the f Kingsley’s ‘ Life,’ vol. ii. p. 171.

MR. HUXLEY’S LECTURES. 



“ I am very glad you like Huxley’s lectures. I have been 
very much struck with them, especially with the ‘ Philosophy 
of Induction.’ I have quarrelled with him for overdoing 
sterility and ignoring cases from Gartner and Kolreuter about 
sterile varieties. His geology is obscure ; and I rather doubt 
about man’s mind and language. But it seems to me ad- 
mirably done, and, as you say, “ Oh my ! ” about the praise of 
the 1 Origin.’ I can’t help liking it, which makes me rather 
ashamed of myself.” 

My father admired the clearness of exposition shown in the 
lectures, and in the following letter urges their author to 
make use of his powers for the advantage of students :]

bably have occurred to you. was reading your Lectures 

and ended by saying, “ I wish he would write a book.” I 
answered, “ he has just written a great book on the skull.” “ I 
don’t call that a book,” she replied, and added, “ I want 
something that people can read ; he does write so well.” 
Now, with your ease in writing, and with knowledge at your 
fingers’ ends, do you not think you could write a popular 
Treatise on Zoology ? Of course it would be some waste of 
time, but I have been asked more than a dozen times to 
recommend something for a beginner and could only think of 
Carpenter’s Zoology. I am sure that a striking Treatise 
would do real service to science by educating naturalists. If 
you were to keep a portfolio open for a couple of years, and 
throw in slips of paper as subjects crossed your mind, you 
would soon have a skeleton (and that seems to me the diffi- 
culty) on which to put the flesh and colours in your inimitable 
manner. I believe such a book might have a brilliant success, 
but I did not intend to scribble so much about it.

[In another letter (Jan. 1865) he returns to the above 
suggestion, though he was in general strongly opposed to 
men of science giving up to the writing of text-books, or to 
teaching, the time that might otherwise have been given to 
original research. 

“ I knew there was very little chance of your having time 
to write a popular treatise on Zoology, but you are about the 
one man who could do it At the time I felt it would be 
almost a sin for you to do it, as it would of course destroy 
some original work. On the other hand I sometimes think 
that general and popular treatises are almost as important for 
the progress of science as original work.” 

The series of letters will continue the history of the year 
1863.]

SCIENCE IN THE COLONIES. 



Now for pleasanter subjects ; we were all amused at your 
defence of stamp collecting and collecting generally. . . . But, 
by Jove, I can hardly stomach a grown man collecting stamps. 
Who would ever have thought of your collecting Wedgwood- 
ware ! but that is wholly different, like engravings or pictures. 
We are degenerate descendants of old Josiah W., for we have 
not a bit of pretty ware in the house. 

. . . Notwithstanding the very pleasant reason you give for 
our not enjoying a holiday, namely, that we have no vices, it 
is a horrid bore. I have been trying for health’s sake to be 
idle, with no success. What I shall now have to do, will be to 
erect a tablet in Down Church, “ Sacred to the Memory, &c.,’’ 
and officially die, and then publish books, “ by the late Charles 
Darwin," for I cannot think what has come over me of late ; I 
always suffered from the excitement of talking, but now it has 
become ludicrous. I talked lately ij hours (broken by tea 
by myself) with my nephew, and I was [ill] half the night 
It is a fearful evil for self and family. 

Good-night Ever yours,

[The following letter to Sir Julius von Haast,* is an 
example of the sympathy which he felt with the spread and 
growth of science in the colonies. It was a feeling not 
expressed once only, but was frequently present in his 
mind, and often found utterance. When we, at Cambridge, 
had the satisfaction of receiving Sir J. von Haast into our 
body as a Doctor of Science (July 1886), I had the oppor- 
tunity of hearing from him of the vivid pleasure which this, 
and other letters from my father, gave him. It was pleasant 
to see how strong had been the impression made by my 
father's warm-hearted sympathy — an impression which seemed,

first received :] 

C. Darwin to Julius von Haast. 

Down, Jan. 22 [1863]. 

Dear Sir, — I thank you most sincerely for sending me 
your Address and the Geological Report* I have seldom in 
my life read anything more spirited and interesting than your 
address. The progress of your colony makes one proud, and 
it is really admirable to see a scientific institution founded in 
so young a nation. I thank you for the very honourable 
notice of my ‘Origin of Species.’ You will easily believe 
how much I have been interested by your striking facts on 
the old glacial period, and I suppose the world might be 
searched in vain for so grand a display of terraces. You 
have, indeed, a noble field for scientific research and dis- 
covery. I have been extremely much interested by what you 
say about the tracks of supposed [living] mammalia. Might 
I ask, if you succeed in discovering what the creatures are, 
you would have the great kindness to inform me ? Perhaps 
they may turn out something like the Solenhofen bird 
creature, with its long tail and fingers, with claws to its 
wings! I may mention that in South America, in com- 
pletely uninhabited regions, I found spring rat-traps, baited 
with cheese , were very successful in catching the smaller 
mammals. I would venture to suggest to you to urge on 
some of the capable members of your institution to observe 
annually the rate and manner of spreading of European 
weeds and insects, and especially to observe what native 
plants most fail; this latter point has never been attended to. 
Do the introduced hive-bees replace any other insect? &c. 
All such points are, in my opinion, great desiderata in

Down, Feb. 16 [1863]. 

Dear AND RESPECTED Sir. — I thank you sincerely for 
your letter and your pamphlet I had heard (I think in one 
of M. Quatrefages’ books) of your work, and was most 
anxious to read it, but did not know where to find it You 
could not have made me a more valuable present I have 
only just returned home, and have not yet read your work ; 
when I do if I wish to ask any questions I will venture to 
trouble you. Your approbation of my book on Species has 
gratified me extremely. Several naturalists in England, 
North America, and Germany, have declared that their 
opinions on the subject have in some degree been modified, 
but as far as I know, my book has produced no effect what- 
ever in France, and this makes me the more gratified by your 
very kind expression of approbation. Pray believe me, dear 
Sir, with much respect, 

Yours faithfully and obliged,

not seen the Athenaum* but I have sent for it, and may get 
it to-morrow ; and will then say what I think. 

I have read Lyell’s book. [‘ The Antiquity of Man.’] The 
whole certainly struck me as a compilation, but of the highest 
class, for when possible the facts have been verified on the 
spot, making it almost an original work. The Glacial chapters 
seem to me best, and in parts magnificent. I could hardly 
judge about Man, as all the gloss of novelty was completely 
worn off. But certainly the aggregation of the evidence 
produced a very striking effect on my mind. The chapter 
comparing language and changes of species, seems most 
ingenious and interesting. He has shown great skill in 
picking out salient points in the argument for change of 
species ; but I am deeply disappointed (I do not mean 
personally) to find that his timidity prevents him giving 
any judgment . . . From all my communications with him 
I must ever think that he has really entirely lost faith in 
the immutability of species ; and yet one of his strongest 
sentences is nearly as follows : “ If it should ever f be 
rendered highly probable that species change by variation 
and natural selection,” &c. &c. I had hoped he would have 
guided the public as far as his own belief went. . . . One 
thing does please me on this subject, that he seems to 
appreciate your work. No doubt the public or a part may be 
induced to think that, as he gives to us a larger space than 
to Lamarck, he must think there is something in our views. 
When reading the brain chapter, it struck me forcibly that if 



• In the ‘Antiquity of Man,’ 
first edition, p. 480, Lyell criticised 
somewhat severely Owen’s account 
of the difference between the Hu- 
man and Simian brains. The num- 
ber of the Athenaum here referred 
to (1863, p. 262) contains a reply 
by Professor Owen to Lyell’s stric- 
tures. The surprise expressed by 
my father was at the revival of a 



controversy which every one be- 
lieved to be closed. Prof. Huxley 
( Medical Times , Oct. 25, 1862, 
quoted in * Man’s Place in Nature,’ 
p. 1 17) spoke of the “two years 
during which this preposterous con- 
troversy has dragged its weary 
length.” And this no doubt ex- 
pressed a very general feeling,

‘ANTIQUITY OF MAN.’ 



he had said openly that he believed in change of species, and 
as a consequence that man was derived from some Quadru- 
manous animal, it would have been very proper to have 
discussed by compilation the differences in the most important 
organ, viz. the brain. As it is, the chapter seems to me to 
come in rather by the head and shoulders. I do not think 
(but then I am as prejudiced as Falconer and Huxley, or more 
so) that it is too severe ; it struck me as given with judicial 
force. It might perhaps be said with truth that he had no 
business to judge on a subject on which he knows nothing ; 
but compilers must do this to a certain extent (You know I 
value and rank high compilers, being one myself!) I have 
taken you at your word, and scribbled at great length. If I 
get the Atheneeum to-morrow, I will add my impression of 
Owen’s letter. 

. . . The Lyells are coming here on Sunday evening to 
stay till Wednesday. I dread it, but I must say how much 
disappointed I am that he has not spoken out on species, still 
less on man. And the best of the joke is that he thinks he 
has acted with the courage of a martyr of old. I hope I may 
have taken an exaggerated view of his timidity, and shall 
particularly be glad of your opinion on this head.* When 
I got his book I turned over the pages, and saw he had dis- 
cussed the subject of species, and said that I thought he would 
do more to convert the public than all of us, and now (which 
makes the case worse for me) I must, in common honesty, 
retract. I wish to Heaven he had said not a word on the 
subject 

Wednesday morning: I have read the Atheneeum. I do 
not think Lyell will be nearly so much annoyed as you 
expect. The concluding sentence is no doubt very stinging. 

* On this subject my father I am to hear that I have not been

No one but a good anatomist could unravel Owen’s letter ; 
at least it is quite beyond me. 

. . . Lyell’s memory plays him false when he says all anato- 
mists were astonished at Owen’s paper ;• it was often quoted 
with approbation. I well remember Lyell’s admiration at this 
new classification 1 (Do not repeat this.) I remember it, 
because, though I knew nothing whatever about the brain, I 
felt a conviction that a classification thus founded on a single 
character would break down, and it seemed to me a great 
error not to separate more completely the Marsupialia. . . . 

What an accursed evil it is that there should be all this quar- 
relling within, what ought to be, the peaceful realms of science. 

I will go to my own present subject of inheritance and 
forget it all for a time. Farewell, my dear old friend, 

C. Darwin. 



C. Darwin to Asa Gray. 

Down, Feb. 23 [1863]. 

... If you have time to read you will be interested by 
parts of Lyell’s book on man ; but I fear that the best part, 
about the Glacial period, may be too geological for any one 
except a regular geologist. He quotes you at the end with 
gusto. By the way, he told me the other day how pleased 
some had been by hearing that they could purchase your 
pamphlet The Parthenon also speaks of it as the ablest 
contribution to the literature of the subject It delights me 
when I see your work appreciated. 

The Lyells come here this day week, and I shall grumble 
at his excessive caution. . . . The public may well say, if such 
a man dare not or will not speak out his mind, how can we 
who are ignorant form even a guess on the subject ? Lyell 
was pleased when I told him lately that you thought that 
language might be used as an excellent illustration of deriva-

tion of species ; you will see that he has an admirable chapter 
on this. . . . 

I read Cairns’s excellent Lecture,* which shows so well 
how your quarrel arose from Slavery. It made me for a time 
wish honestly for the North ; but I could never help, though I 
tried, all the time thinking how we should be bullied and 
forced into a war by you, when you were triumphant But I 
do most truly think it dreadful that the South, with its 
accursed slavery, should triumph, and spread the evil. I think 
if I had power, which, thank God, I have not, I would let you 
conquer the border States, and all west of the Mississippi, and 
then force you to acknowledge the cotton States. For do 
you not now begin to doubt whether you can conquer and 
hold them ? I have inflicted a long tirade on you. 

The Times is getting more detestable (but that is too weak 
a word) than ever. My good wife wishes to give it up, but I 
tell her that is a pitch of heroism to which only a woman is 
equal. To give up the “Bloody Old Times," as Cobbett 
used to call it, would be to give up meat, drink and air. 
Farewell, my dear Gray, 

Yours most truly, 

C. Darwin.

I have hardly any remarks worth sending, but will scribble a 
little on what most interested me. But I will first get out 
what I hate saying, viz. that I have been greatly disappointed 
that you have not given judgment and spoken fairly out what 
you think about the derivation of species. I should have 
been contented if you had boldly said that species have not

been separately created, and had thrown as much doubt as 
you like on how far variation and natural selection suffices. 
I hope to Heaven I am wrong (and from what you say about 
Whewell it seems so), but I cannot see how your chapters can 
do more good than an extraordinary able review. I think 
the Parthenon is right, that you will leave the public in a fog. 
No doubt they may infer that as you give more space to 
myself, Wallace, and Hooker, than to Lamarck, you think 
more of us. But I had always thought that your judgment 
would have been an epoch in the subject All that is over 
with me, and I will only think on the admirable skill with 
which you have selected the striking points, and explained 
them. No praise can be too strong, in my opinion, for the 
inimitable chapter on language in comparison with species, 
p. 505 — A sentence* at the top of the page makes me 



I know you will forgive me for writing with perfect freedom, 
for you must know how deeply I respect you as my old 
honoured guide and master. I heartily hope and expect that 
your book will have gigantic circulation and may do in many 
ways as much good as it ought to do. I am tired, so no more. 
I have written so briefly that you will have to guess my 
meaning. I fear my remarks are hardly worth sending. 
Farewell, with kindest remembrance to Lady Lyell. 

Ever yours, 

C. Darwin. 

[Mr. Huxley has quoted (Vol. II. p. 193) some passages from 
Lyell’s letters which show his state of mind at this time. The 
following passage, from a letter of March nth to my father, 
is also of much interest : — 



* After speculating on the sudden 
appearance of individuals far above 
the average of the human race, 
Lyell asks if such leaps upwards in 
the scale of intellect may not “ have 
cleared at one bound the space 



which separated the highest stage 
of the unprogressive intelligence of 
the inferior animals from the first 
and lowest form of improvable 
reason manifested by man.”.

“My feelings, however, more than any thought about 
policy or expediency, prevent me from dogmatising as to 
the descent of man from the brutes, which, though I am 
prepared to accept it, takes away much of the charm from 
my speculations on the past relating to such matters. . . . 
But you ought to be satisfied, as I shall bring hundreds 
towards you who, if I treated the matter more dogmatically, 
would have rebelled."] 



C. Darwin to C. Lyell. 

Down, 12th [March, 1863]. 

My DEAR Lyell, — I thank you for your very interesting 
and kind, I may say, charming letter. I feared you might be 
huffed for a little time with me. I know some men would 
have been so. I have hardly any more criticisms, anyhow, 
worth writing. But I may mention that I felt a little surprise 
that old B. de Perthes * was not rather more honourably men- 
tioned. I would suggest whether you could not leave out 
some references to the ‘ Principles ; ’ one for the real student 
is as good as a hundred, and it is rather irritating, and gives 
a feeling of incompleteness to the general reader to be often 
referred to other books. As you say that you have gone as far 
as you believe on the species question, I have not a word to 
say ; but I must feel convinced that at times, judging from 
conversation, expressions, letters, &c., you have as completely 
given up belief in immutability of specific forms as I have 
done. I must still think a clear expression from you, if you 
could have given it, would have been potent with the public, 
and all the more so, as you formerly held opposite opinions. 
The more I work, the more satisfied I become with variation 
and natural selection, but that part of the case I look at as 
less important, though more interesting to me personally. As 
you ask for criticisms on this head (and believe me that

I should not have made them unasked), I may specify 
(pp. 412, 413) that such words as “ Mr. D. labours to show,” 
“is believed by the author to throw light,” would lead a 
common reader to think that you yourself do not at all agree, 
but merely think it fair to give my opinion. Lastly, you 
refer repeatedly to my view as a modification of Lamarck’s 
doctrine of development and progression. If this is your 
deliberate opinion there is nothing to be said, but it does 
not seem so to me. Plato, Buffon, my grandfather before 
Lamarck, and others, propounded the obvious view that if 
species were not created separately they must have descended 
from other species, and I can see nothing else in common 
between the ‘ Origin ’ and Lamarck. I believe this way of 
putting the case is very injurious to its acceptance, as it 
implies necessary progression, and closely connects Wallace’s 
and my views with what I consider, after two deliberate 
readings, as a wretched book, and one from which (I well 
remember my surprise) I gained nothing. But I know you 
rank it higher, which is curious, as it did not in the least 
shake your belief. But enough, and more than enough. 
Please remember you have brought it all down on yourself ! ! 

I am very sorry to hear about Falconer’s “ reclamation.” * 
I hate the very word, and have a sincere affection for him.

‘ANTIQUITY OF MAN.' 



C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down [March 13, 1863]. 

I should have thanked you sooner for the Athenaum and 
very pleasant previous note, but I have been busy, and not a 
little uncomfortable from frequent uneasy feeling of fullness, 
slight pain and tickling about the heart But as I have no 
other symptoms of heart complaint I do not suppose it is 
affected. ... I have had a most kind and delightfully candid 
letter from Lyell, who says he spoke out as far as he believes. 
I have no doubt his belief failed him as he wrote, for I feel 
sure that at times he no more believed in Creation than you 
or I. I have grumbled a bit in my answer to him at his 
always classing my work as a modification of Lamarck’s, 
which it is no more than any author who did not believe in 
immutability of species, and did believe in descent. I am 
very sorry to hear from Lyell that Falconer is going to 
publish a formal reclamation of his own claims. . . . 

It is cruel to think of it, but we must go to Malvern in the 
middle of April ; it is ruin to me.* . . . 



C. Darwin to C. Lyell. 

Down, March 17 [1863]. 

My DEAR Lyell, — I have been much interested by your 
letters and enclosure, and thank you sincerely for giving me 
so much time when you must be so busy. What a curious 
letter from B. de P. [Boucher de Perthes], He seems per- 
fectly satisfied, and must be a very amiable man. I know 
something about his errors, and looked at his book many 
years ago, and am ashamed to think that I concluded the

whole was rubbish! Yet he has done for man something 
like what Agassiz did for glaciers.* 

I cannot say that I agree with Hooker about the public 
not liking to be told what to conclude, if coming from one in 
your position. But I am heartily sorry that I was led to make 
complaints, or something very like complaints, on the manner 
in which you have treated the subject, and still more so any- 
thing about myself. I steadily endeavour never to forget my 
firm belief that no one can at all judge about his own work. 
As for Lamarck, as you have such a man as Grove with you, 
you are triumphant ; not that I can alter my opinion that to 
me it was an absolutely useless book. Perhaps this was 
owing to my always searching books for facts, perhaps from 
knowing my grandfather’s earlier and identically the same 
speculation. I will only further say that if I can analyse my 
own feelings (a very doubtful process), it is nearly as much 
for your sake as for my own, that I so much wish that your 
state of belief could have permitted you to say boldly and 
distinctly out that species were not separately created. I 
have generally told you the progress of opinion, as I have 
heard it, on the species question. A first-rate German natur- 
alist t (I now forget the name 1), who has lately published a 
grand folio, has spoken out to the utmost extent on the 
‘ Origin.’ De Candolle, in a very good paper on “ Oaks,” 
goes, in Asa Gray’s opinion, as far as he himself does ; but 
De Candolle, in writing to me, says we, “ we think this and 
that so that I infer he really goes to the full extent with me, 
and tells me of a French good botanical palaeontologist (name

my views will ultimately prevail. But I did not intend to 
have written all this. It satisfies me with the final results, 
but this result, I begin to see, will take two or three life- 
times. The entomologists are enough to keep the subject 
back for half a century. I really pity your having to 
balance the claims of so many eager aspirants for notice ; it 
is clearly impossible to satisfy all. . . . Certainly I was struck 
with the full and due honour you conferred on Falconer.

It will be some time before we see “slime, protoplasm, &c.” 
generating a new animal.* But I have long regretted that I 
truckled to public opinion, and used the Pentateuchal term 
of creation, f by which I really meant “ appeared ” by some 
wholly unknown process. It is mere rubbish, thinking at

origin of matter. 



C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, Friday night [April 17, 1863]. 
My DEAR HOOKER, — I have heard from Oliver that you 
will be now at Kew, and so I am going to amuse myself by 
scribbling a bit. I hope you have thoroughly enjoyed your 



“ Under the inAuence of his fore- 
gone conclusion that I have ac- 
cepted Mr. Darwin as my master, 
and his hypothesis as my guide, 
your reviewer represents me as 
blind to the significance of the 
general fact stated by me, that 
‘ there has been no advance in the 
foraminiferous type from the palae- 
ozoic period to the present time.’ 
But for such a foregone conclusion 
he would have recognised in this 
statement the expression of my 
conviction that the present state of 
scientific evidence, instead of sanc- 
tioning the idea that the descend- 
ants of the primitive type or types 
of Foraminifera can ever rise to 
any higher grade, justifies the anti- 
Darwinian inference, that however 
widely they diverge from each other 
and from their originals, they still 
remain Foraminifera .” 

* On the same subject my father 
wrote in 1871 : “ It is often said 
that all the conditions for the first 
production of a living organism are 



now present, which could ever have 
been present. But if (and oh ! 
what a big if !j we could conceive 
in some warm little pond, with all 
sorts of ammonia and phosphoric 
salts, light, heat, electricity, &c., 
present, that a proteine compound 
was chemically formed ready to 
undergo still more complex changes, 

would be instantly devoured or ab- 
sorbed, which would not have been 
the case before living creatures 

t This refers to a passage in 
which the reviewer of Dr. Car- 
penter’s book speaks of “ an opera- 
tion of force,” or “a concurrence 
of forces which have now no place 
in nature,” as being, “a creative 
force, in fact, which Darwin could 
only express in Pentateuchal terms 
as the primordial form ‘ into which 
life was first breathed.’ ” The con-

attempt to explain specific transmutation are in fact related 
to it in this wise, that they have prepared the minds of 
naturalists for a better reception of such attempts to explain 
the way of the origin of species from species.” 

To this my father replied as follows in the A thenceum of 
May 9th, 1863 :] 

Down, May 5 [1863]. 

I hope that you will grant me space to own that your 
reviewer is quite correct when he states that any theory of 
descent will connect, “ by an intelligible thread of reasoning,” 
the several generalizations before specified. I ought to have 
made this admission expressly; with the reservation, how- 
ever, that, as far as I can judge, no theory so well explains or 
connects these several generalizations (more especially the 
formation of domestic races in comparison with natural 
species, the principles of classification, embryonic resemblance, 
&c.) as the theory, or hypothesis, or guess, if the reviewer so 
likes to call it, of Natural Selection. Nor has any other 
satisfactory explanation been ever offered of the almost 
perfect adaptation of all organic beings to each other, and to 
their physical conditions of life. Whether the naturalist 
believes in the views given by Lamarck, by Geoffrey St. 
Hilaire, by the author of the 1 Vestiges,’ by Mr. Wallace and 
myself, or in any other such view, signifies extremely little in 
comparison with the admission that species have descended 
from other species, and have not been created immutable ; 
for he who admits this as a great truth has a wide field 
opened to him for further inquiry. I believe, however, from 
what I see of the progress of opinion on the Continent, and in 
this country, that the theory of Natural Selection will 
ultimately be adopted, with, no doubt, many subordinate 
modifications and improvements.

Leith Hill Place, 

Saturday [May 11, 1863]. 

My dear Hooker, — You give good advice about not 
writing in newspapers; I have been gnashing my teeth at 

my own folly ; and this not caused by 's sneers, which 

were so good that I almost enjoyed them. I have written 
once again to own to a certain extent of truth in what he 
says, and then if I am ever such a fool again, have no mercy 
on me. I have read the squib in Public Opinion;* it is 
capital ; if there is more, and you have a copy, do lend it. It 
shows well that a scientific man had better be trampled in 
dirt than squabble. I have been drawing diagrams, dissecting 
shoots, and muddling my brains to a hopeless degree about 
the divergence of leaves, and have of course utterly failed. 
But I can see that the subject is most curious, and indeed 
astonishing

address to the Linnean Society (May 25, 1863). Mr. Bentham 
does not yield to the new theory of Evolution, “ cannot 
surrender at discretion so long as many important outworks 
remain contestable.” But he shows that the great body of 
scientific opinion is flowing in the direction of belief. 

The mention of Pasteur by Mr. Bentham is in reference 
to the promulgation “as it were ex cathedrA ,” of a theory 
of spontaneous generation by the reviewer of Dr. Carpenter 
in the Athenaeum (March 28, 1863). Mr. Bentham points 
out that in ignoring Pasteur’s refutation of the supposed 
facts of spontaneous generation, the writer fails to act with 
“that impartiality which every reviewer is supposed to 
possess.”] 



C. Darwin to G. Bentham. 

Down, May 22 [1863]. 

My dear Bentham. — I am much obliged for your kind 
and interesting letter. I have no fear of anything that a 
man like you will say annoying me in the very least degree. 
On the other hand, any approval from one whose judgment 
and knowledge I have for many years so sincerely respected, 
will gratify me much. The objection which you well put, of 
certain forms remaining unaltered through long time and 
space, is no doubt formidable in appearance, and to a certain 
extent in reality according to my judgment. But does not 
the difficulty rest much on our silently assuming that we know 
more than we do ? I have literally found nothing so difficult 
as to try and always remember our ignorance. I am never 
weary, when walking in any new adjoining district or country, 
of reflecting how absolutely ignorant we are why certain old 
plants are not there present, and other new ones are, and 
others in different proportions. If we once fully feel this, then 
in judging the theory of Natural Selection, which implies that 
a form will remain unaltered unless some alteration be to its

benefit, is it so very wonderful that some forms should change 
much slower and much less, and some few should have 
changed not at all under conditions which to us (who really 
know nothing what are the important conditions) seem very 
different. Certainly a priori we might have anticipated that 
all the plants anciently introduced into Australia would have 
undergone some modification ; but the fact that they have 
not been modified does not seem to me a difficulty of weight 
enough to shake a belief grounded on other arguments. I 
have expressed myself miserably, but I am far from well 
to-day. 

I am very glad that you are going to allude to Pasteur ; I 
was struck with infinite admiration at his work. With cordial 
thanks, believe me, dear Bentham, 

Yours very sincerely, 

Ch. Darwin. 

P.S. — In fact the belief in Natural Selection must at present 
be grounded entirely on general considerations. (1) On its 
being a vera causa, from the struggle for existence ; and the 
certain geological fact that species do somehow change. (2) 
From the analogy of change under domestication by man’s 
selection. (3) And chiefly from this view connecting under 
an intelligible point of view a host of facts. When we descend 
to details, we can prove that no one species has changed 
[«>. we cannot prove that a single species has changed] ; 
nor can we prove that the supposed changes are beneficial, 
which is the groundwork of the theory. Nor can we 
explain why some species have changed and others have 
not. The latter case seems to me hardly more difficult to 
understand precisely and in detail than the former case of 
supposed change. Bronn may ask in vain, the old creationist 
school and the new school, why one mouse has longer ears 
than another mouse, and one plant more pointed leaves than 
another plant.

C. Darwin to G. Bentham. 

Down, June 19 [1863]. 

My DEAR Bentham, — I have been extremely much pleased 
and interested by your address, which you kindly sent me. 
It seems to be excellently done, with as much judicial calm- 
ness and impartiality as the Lord Chancellor could have 
shown. But whether the “immutable” gentlemen would 
agree with the impartiality may be doubted, there is too 
much kindness shown towards me, Hooker, and others, they 
might say. Moreover I verily believe that your address, 
written as it is, will do more to shake the unshaken and bring 
on those leaning to our side, than anything written directly in 
favour of transmutation. I can hardly tell why it is, but your 
address has pleased me as much as Lyell’s book disappointed 
me, that is, the part on species, though so cleverly written. I 
agree with all your remarks on the reviewers. By the way, 
Lecoq* is a believer in the change of species. I, for one, can 
conscientiously declare that I never feel surprised at any one 
sticking to the belief of immutability ; though I am often not 
a little surprised at the arguments advanced on this side. I 
remember too well my endless oscillations of doubt and diffi- 
culty. It is to me really laughable, when I think of the years 
which elapsed before I saw what I believe to be the explana- 
tion of some parts of the case ; I believe it was fifteen years 
after I began before I saw the meaning and cause of the 
divergence of the descendants of any one pair. You pay me 
some most elegant and pleasing compliments. There is much 
in your address which has pleased me much, especially your 
remarks on various naturalists. I am so glad that you have 
alluded so honourably to Pasteur. I have just read over this 
note ; it does not express strongly enough the interest which 
I have felt in reading your address. You have done, I

Bentham, 

Yours very sincerely, 

Ch. Darwin. 



1864. 

[In my father’s diary for 1864 is the entry, “ 111 all January, 
February, March.” About the middle of April (seven months 
after the beginning of the illness in the previous autumn) his 
health took a turn for the better. As soon as he was able 
to do any work, he began to write his papers on Lythrum, 
and on Climbing Plants, so that the work which now con- 
cerns us did not begin until September, when he again set to 
work on ‘ Animals and Plants.’ A letter to Sir J. D. Hooker 
gives some account of the re-commencement of the work : 
“ I have begun looking over my old MS., and it is as fresh 
as if I had never written it ; parts are astonishingly dull, but 
yet worth printing, I think ; and other parts strike me as very 
good. I am a complete millionaire in odd and curious little 
facts, and I have been really astounded at my own industry 
whilst reading my chapters on Inheritance and Selection. 
God knows when the book will ever be completed, for I find 
that I am very weak and on my best days cannot do more 
than one or one and a half hours’ work. It is a good deal 
harder than writing about my dear climbing plants.” 

In this year he received the greatest honour which a scientific 
man can receive in this country — the Copley Medal of the 
Royal Society. It is presented at the Anniversary Meeting 
on St Andrew’s Day (Nov. 30), the medallist being usually 
present to receive it, but this the state of my father’s health 
prevented. He wrote to Mr. Fox on this subject: — 

"I was glad to see your hand-writing. The Copley, 
being open to all sciences and all the world, is reckoned a 
great honour ; but excepting from several kind letters, such 
things make little difference to me. It shows, however, that

[1864. 



Natural Selection is making some progress in this country, and 
that pleases me. The subject, however, is safe in foreign lands.” 
To Sir J. D. Hooker, also, he wrote : — 

“ How kind you have been about this medal ; indeed, I am 
blessed with many good friends, and I have received four or 
five notes which have warmed my heart I often wonder that 
so old a worn-out dog as I am is not quite forgotten. Talking 
of medals, has Falconer had the Royal ? he surely ought to 
have it, as ought John Lubbock. By the way, the latter tells 
me that some old members of the Royal are quite shocked at 
my having the Copley. Do you know who ? ” 

He wrote to Mr. Huxley : — 

“ I must and will answer you, for it is a real pleasure for me 
to thank you cordially for your note. Such notes as this of 
yours, and a few others, are the real medal to me, and not the 
round bit of gold. These have given me a pleasure which 
will long endure ; so believe in my cordial thanks for your note." 

Sir Charles Lyell, writing to my father in November 1864 
(‘ Life,’ vol. ii. p. 384), speaks of the supposed malcontents as 
being afraid to crown anything so unorthodox as the ‘ Origin.’ 
But he adds that if such were their feelings ” they had the 
good sense to draw in their horns.” It appears, however, from 
the same letter, that the proposal to give the Copley Medal 
to my father in the previous year failed owing to a similar 
want of courage— to Lyell’s great indignation. 

In the Reader , December 3, 1864, General Sabine’s presi- 
dential address at the Anniversary Meeting is reported at 
some length. Special weight was laid on my father’s work in 
Geology, Zoology, and Botany, but the ‘ Origin of Species ’ is 
praised chiefly as containing “ a mass of observations,” &c. 
It is curious that as in the case of his election to the French 
Institute, so in this case, he was honoured not for the great 
work of his life, but for his less important work in special 
lines. The paragraph in General Sabine’s address which 
refers to the ' Origin of Species,’ is as follows : — 



© The Complete Work of Charles Darwin Online 



1 864-] COPLEY MEDAL — PROF. KOLLIKER. 29 

“ In his most recent work * On the Origin of Species,’ although 
opinions may be divided or undecided with respect to its 
merits in some respects, all will allow that it contains a mass 
of observations bearing upon the habits, structure, affinities, 
and distribution of animals, perhaps unrivalled for interest, 
minuteness, and patience of observation. Some amongst us 
may perhaps incline to accept the theory indicated by the 
title of this work, while others may perhaps incline to refuse, 
or at least to remit it to a future time, when increased know- 
ledge shall afford stronger grounds for its ultimate acceptance 
or rejection. Speaking generally and collectively, we have 
expressly omitted it from the grounds of our award.” 

I believe I am right in saying that no little dissatisfaction 
at the President’s manner of allusion to the ‘ Origin ’ was 
felt by some Fellows of the Society. 

The presentation of the Copley Medal is of interest in 
another way, inasmuch as it led to Sir C. Lyell making, in 
his after-dinner speech, a “confession of faith as to the 
‘ Origin.’ ” He wrote to my father (‘ Life,’ vol ii. p. 384), " I 
said I had been forced to give up my old faith without 
thoroughly seeing my way to a new one. But I think you 
would have been satisfied with the length I went”]

anything better done. I had much wished his article answered, 
and indeed thought of doing so myself, so that I considered 
several points. You have hit on all, and on some in addition, 
and oh ! by Jove, how well you have done it As I read on 
and came to point after point on which I had thought, I could 
not help jeering and scoffing at myself, to see how infinitely 
better you had done it than I could have done. Well, if any 
one, who does not understand Natural Selection, will read this, 
he will be a blockhead if it is not as clear as daylight Old 
Flourens * was hardly worth the powder and shot ; but how 
capitally you bring in about the Academician, and your 
metaphor of the sea-sand is inimitable. 

It is a marvel to me how you can resist becoming a regular 
reviewer. Well, I have exploded now, and it has done me a 
deal of good. . . . 

[In the same article in the * Natural History Review,’ Mr. 
Huxley speaks of the book above alluded to by Flourens, the 
Secretaire Perpdtuel of the French Academy, as one of the 
two “ most elaborate criticisms ” of the ‘ Origin of Species ’ 
of the year. He quotes the following passage : — 

“ M. Darwin continue : 1 Aucune distinction absolue n’a etc 
et ne peut fitre 6tablie entre les espfeces et les varietes ! Je 
vous ai deji dit que vous vous trompiez ; une distinction 
absolue s£pare les vari£t£s d’avec les especes.” Mr. Huxley 
remarks on this, “ Being devoid of the blessings of an Aca- 
demy in England, we are unaccustomed to see our ablest men 
treated in this way even by a Perpetual Secretary.” After 
demonstrating M. Flourens’ misapprehension of Natural 
Selection, Mr. Huxley says, “ How one knows it all by heart, 
and with what relief one reads at p. 65, ‘Je laisse M. 
Darwin.’ ” 

On the same subject my father wrote to Mr. Wallace : — 
“A great gun, Flourens, has written a little dull book 
* ‘ Examen du livre de M. Darwin sur l'origine des espices. Par 
P. Flourens.’ 8vo. Paris, 1864.

against me, which pleases me much, for it is plain that our 
good work is spreading in France. He speaks of the 
* engouement ’ about this book ‘ so full of empty and 
presumptuous thoughts.’” The passage here alluded to is 
as follows : — 

“‘Enfin l’ouvrage de M. Darwin a paru. On ne peut 
qu’fitre frappd du talent de l’auteur. Mais que d’iddes ob- 
scures, que d’itlccs fausses ! Quel jargon mdtaphysique jetd

Quel langage prdtentieux et vide ! Quelles pcrsonnifications 
puiriles et surannees 1 O luciditd! O soliditd de l’esprit 
frangais, que devenez-vous ? ’ ’’] 

1865. 

[This was again a time of much ill-health, but towards the 
close of the year he began to recover under the care of the 
late Dr. Bence-Jones, who dieted him severely, and as he 
expressed it, “half-starved him to death.” He was able to 
work at ‘ Animals and Plants ’ until nearly the end of April, 
and from that time until December he did practically no work, 
with the exception of looking over the ‘ Origin of Species ’ 
for a second French edition. He wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker : 
— “ I am, as it were, reading the * Origin ’ for the first time, 
for I am correcting for a second French edition : and upon 
my life, my dear fellow, it is a very good book, but oh 1 my 
gracious, it is tough reading, and I wish it were done.” * 

The following letter refers to the Duke of Argyll’s address 
to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, December 5th, 1864, in 
which he criticises the ‘ Origin of Species.’ My father seems 
to have read the Duke’s address as reported in the Scotsman 
of December 6th, 1865. In a letter to my father (Jan. 16,

father received the news of a new ist Lesquereux. HewrotetoSir J. D.

a great step towards your views — far greater, I believe, than 
it seems when read merely with reference to criticisms and 
objections ” :] 

C. Darwin to C. Lyell. 

Down, January 22, 1865. 

My dear Lyell, — I thank you for your very interesting 
letter. I have the true English instinctive reverence for rank, 
and therefore liked to hear about the Princess Royal.* You 
ask what I think of the Duke’s address, and I shall be glad to 
tell you. It seems to me extremely clever, like everything I 
have read of his ; but I am not shaken — perhaps you will say 
that neither gods nor men could shake me. I demur to the 
Duke reiterating his objection that the brilliant plumage of 
the male humming-bird could not have been acquired through 
selection, at the same time entirely ignoring my discussion 
(p. 93. 3 r d edition) on beautiful plumage being acquired 
through sexual selection. The Duke may think this insuf- 
ficient, but that is another question. All analogy makes me 
quite disagree with the Duke that the difference in the beak, 
wing, and tail, are not of importance to the several species. 
In the only two species which I have watched, the difference 
in flight and in the use of the tail was conspicuously great. 

The Duke, who knows my Orchid book so well, might have 
learnt a lesson of caution from it, with respect to his doctrine

of differences for mere variety or beauty. It may be con- 
fidently said that no tribe of plants presents such grotesque 
and beautiful differences, which no one until lately, conjectured 
were of any use ; but now in almost every case I have been 
able to show their important service. It should be re- 
membered that with humming-birds or orchids, a modification 
in one part will cause correlated changes in other parts. I 
agree with what you say about beauty. I formerly thought 
a good deal on the subject, and was led quite to repudiate the 
doctrine of beauty being created for beauty’s sake. I demur 
also to the Duke’s expression of “ new births.” That may be 
a very good theory, but it is not mine, unless indeed he calls 
a bird bom with a beak j^gth of an inch longer than usual 
“ a new birth ; ” but this is not the sense in which the term 
would usually be understood. The more I work, the more I 
feel convinced that it is by the accumulation of such extremely 
slight variations that new species arise. I do not plead guilty 
to the Duke’s charge, that I forget that natural selection means 
only the preservation of variations which independently arise.* 
I have expressed this in as strong language as I could use, 
but it would have been infinitely tedious had I on every 
occasion thus guarded myself. I will cry “ peccavi ” when I 
hear of the Duke or you attacking breeders for saying that 
man has made his improved shorthorns, or pouter pigeons, or 
bantams. And I could quote still stronger expressions used 
by agriculturists. Man does make his artificial breeds, for his 
selective power is of such importance relatively to that of the 
slight spontaneous variations. But no one will attack breeders 
for using such expressions, and the rising generation will not 
blame me. 

Many thanks for your offer of sending me the ‘ Elements.’ t

I hope to read it all, but unfortunately reading makes my 
head whiz more than anything else. I am able most days to 
work for two or three hours, and this makes all the difference 
in my happiness. I have resolved not to be tempted astray, 
and to publish nothing till my volume on Variation is com- 
pleted. You gave me excellent advice about the footnotes in 
my Dog chapter, but their alteration gave me infinite trouble, 
and I often wished all the dogs, and I fear sometimes you 
yourself, in the nether regions. 

We (dictator and writer) send our best love to Lady Lyell. 

Yours affectionately,

P.S. — If ever you should speak with the Duke on the sub- 
ject, please say how much interested I was with his address. 

[In his autobiographical sketch, my father has remarked 
(p. 40) that owing to certain early memories he felt the 
honour of being elected to the Royal and Royal Medical 
Societies of Edinburgh “more than any similar honour.” 
The following extract from a letter to Sir Joseph Hooker 
refers to his election to the former of these societies. The 
latter part of the extract refers to the Berlin Academy, to 
which he was elected in 1878 : — 

“ Here is a really curious thing, considering that Brewster 
is President and Balfour Secretary. I have been elected 
Honorary Member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. And 
this leads me to a third question. Does the Berlin Academy 
of Sciences send their Proceedings to Honorary Members ? I 
want to know, to ascertain whether I am a member ; I suppose 
not, for I think it would have made some impression on me ; 
yet I distinctly remember receiving some diploma signed by 
Ehrenberg. I have been so careless; I have lost several 
diplomas, and now I want to know what Societies I belong to, 
as I observe every [one] tacks their titles to their names in the 
catalogue of the Royal Soc.”]

LYELL’S ‘ELEMENTS.’

1865 -] 



C. Darwin to C. Lyell. 

Down, Feb. 21 [1865]. 

My dear Lyell, — I have taken a long time to thank you 
very much for your present of the ‘ Elements.’ 

I am going through it all, reading what is new, and what I 
have forgotten, and this is a good deal. 

I am simply astonished at the amount of labour, knowledge, 
and clear thought condensed in this work. The whole strikes 
me as something quite grand. I have been particularly 
interested by your account of Heer’s work and your discussion 
on the Atlantic Continent. I am particularly delighted at 
the view which you take on this subject; for I have long 
thought Forbes did an ill service in so freely making 
continents. 

I have also been very glad to read your argument on the 
denudation of the Weald, and your excellent rtsumi on the 
Purbeck Beds ; and this is the point at which I have at present 
arrived in your book. I cannot say that I am quite convinced 
that there is no connection beyond that pointed out by you, 
between glacial action and the formation of lake basins ; but 
you will not much value my opinion on this head, as I have 
already changed my mind some half-dozen times. 

I want to make a suggestion to you. I found the weight 
of your volume intolerable, especially when lying down, so 
with great boldness cut it into two pieces, and took it out of 
its cover ; now could not Murray without any other change 
add to his advertisement a line saying, “ if bound in two 
volumes, one shilling or one shilling and sixpence extra.” You 
thus might originate a change which would be a blessing to 
all weak-handed readers. 

Believe me, my dear Lyell, 

Yours most sincerely, 

Charles Darwin.

C. Darwin to John Lubbock. 



Down, June 11 [1865]. 

My dear Lubbock,— The latter half of your bookf has 
been read aloud to me, and the style is so clear and easy 
(we both think it perfection) that I am now beginning at the 
beginning. I cannot resist telling you how excellently well, 
in my opinion, you have done the very interesting chapter on 
savage life. Though you have necessarily only compiled the 
materials the general result is most original. But I ought to 
keep the term original for your last chapter, which has struck 
me as an admirable and profound discussion. It has quite 
delighted me, for now the public will see what kind of man 
you are, which I am proud to think I discovered a dozen 
years ago. 

I do sincerely wish you all success in your election and in 
politics ; but after reading this last chapter, you must let me 
say : oh, dear 1 oh, dear ! oh dear 1 

Yours affectionately, 

Ch. Darwin.

* This was a favourite reform of 
my father’s. He wrote to the 
Athenaum on the subject, Feb. 5, 
1867, pointing out that a book 
cut, even carefully, with a paper 
knife collects dust on its edges far 
more than a machine-cut book. 
He goes on to quote the case of 
a lady of his acquaintance who 
was in the habit of cutting books 
with her thumb, and finally appeals 
to the Athenaum to earn the grati- 
tude of children “ who have to cut 



through dry and pictureless books 
for the benefit of their elders.” He 
tried to introduce the reform in the 
case of his own books, but found 
the conservatism of booksellers too 
strong for him. The presentation

books were sent out with the edges

Darwin,’ which was afterwards translated, at my father’s

first of the long series of letters which my father wrote to 
this distinguished naturalist. They never met, but the 
correspondence with Muller, which continued to the close of 
my father’s life, was a source of very great pleasure to him. 
My impression is that of all his unseen friends Fritz Muller 
was the one for whom he had the strongest regard. Fritz 
Muller is the brother of another distinguished man, the late 
Hermann Muller, the author of ‘ Die Befruchtung der Blumen,’ 
and of much other valuable work :] 



C. Darwin to F. Muller. 

Down, August io [1865]. 

My dear Sir,— I have been for a long time so ill that I 
have only just finished hearing read aloud your work on 
species. And now you must permit me to thank you 
cordially for the great interest with which I have read it 
You have done admirable service in the cause in which we 
both believe. Many of your arguments seem to me excellent, 
and many of your facts wonderful. Of the latter, nothing has 
surprised me so much as the two forms of males. I have 
lately investigated the cases of dimorphic plants, and I should 
much like to send you one or two of my papers if I knew 
how. I did send lately by post a paper on climbing plants, 
as an experiment to see whether it would reach you. One of 
the points which has struck me most in your paper is that on 
the differences in the air-breathing apparatus of the several 
forms. This subject appeared to me very important when I 
formerly considered the electric apparatus of fishes. Your

observations on Classification and Embryology seem to me 
very good and original. They show what a wonderful field 
there is for enquiry on the development of Crustacea, and 
nothing has convinced me so plainly what admirable results 
we shall arrive at in Natural History in the course of a few 
years. What a marvellous range of structure the Crustacea 
present, and how well adapted they are for your enquiry ! 
Until reading your book I knew nothing of the Rhizocephala ; 
pray look at my account and figures of Anelasma, for it seems 
to me that this latter cirripede is a beautiful connecting link 
with the Rhizocephala. 

If ever you have any opportunity, as you are so skilful a 
dissector, I much wish that you would look to the orifice at 
the base of the first pair of cirrhi in cirripedes, and at the 
curious organ in it, and discover what its nature is ; I sup- 
pose I was quite in error, yet I cannot feel fully satisfied at 
Krohn’s * observations. Also if you ever find any species of 
Scalpellum, pray look for complemental males ; a German 
author has recently doubted my observations, for no reason 
except that the facts appeared to him so strange. 

Permit me again to thank you cordially for the pleasure 
which I have derived from your work, and to express my 
sincere admiration for your valuable researches. 

Believe me, dear Sir, with sincere respect, 

Yours very faithfully, 

Ch. Darwin. 

P.S. — I do not know whether you care at all about plants, 
but if so, I should much like to send you my little work on 
the ‘ Fertilization of Orchids,’ and I think I have a German 
copy. 

Could you spare me a photograph of yourself? I should 
much like to possess one.

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, Thursday, 27th [Sept. 186;]. 

My DEAR HOOKER, — I had intended writing this morning 
to thank Mrs. Hooker most sincerely for her last and several 
notes about you, and now your own note in your hand has 
rejoiced me. To walk between five and six miles is splendid, 
with a little patience you must soon be well. I knew you had 
been very ill, but I hardly knew how ill, until yesterday, when 
Bentham (from the Cranworths *) called here, and I was able 
to see him for ten minutes. He told me also a little about 
the last days of your father ; t I wish I had known your father 
better, my impression is confined to his remarkably cordial, 
courteous and frank bearing. I fully concur and understand 
what you say about the difference of feeling in the loss of a 
father and child. I do not think any one could love a father 
much more than I did mine, and I do not believe three or four 
days ever pass without my still thinking of him, but his death 
at eighty-four caused me nothing of that insufferable grief { 
which the loss of poor dear Annie caused. And this seems to 
me perfectly natural, for one knows that for years previously

t Sir Wm. Hooker; b. 1785, 
d. 1865. He took charge of the 
Royal Gardens at Kew, in 1840, 
when they ceased to be the private 
gardens of the Royal Family. In 
doing so, he gave up his professor- 
ship at Glasgow — and with it half 
of his income. He founded the 
herbarium and library, and within 
ten years he succeeded in making 
the gardens the first in the world. 
It is, thus, not too much to say that 
the creation of the establishment 
at Kew is due to the abilities and 
self-devotion of Sir William Hooker. 



While, for the subsequent develop- 
ment of the gardens up to their 
present magnificent condition, the 
nation must thank Sir Joseph 
Hooker, in whom the same qualities 
are so conspicuous. 

t I may quote here a passage 
from a letter of November 1863. 
It was written to a friend who had 
lost his child : “ How well I re- 
member your feeling, when we lost 
Annie. It was my greatest comfort 
that I had never spoken a harsh 
word to her. Your grief has made 
me shed a few tears over our poor 
darling ; but believe me that these 
tears have lost that unutterable 
bitterness of former days.”

that one’s father’s death is drawing slowly nearer and nearer, 
while the death of one’s child is a sudden and dreadful 
wrench. What a wonderful deal you read ; it is a horrid evil 
for me that I can read hardly anything, for it makes my head 
almost immediately begin to sing violently. My good 
womenkind read to me a great deal, but I dare not ask for 
much science, and am not sure that I could stand it I 
enjoyed Tylor * extremely , and the first part of Lecky ; t but 
I think the latter is often vague, and gives a false appearance 
of throwing light on his subject by such phrases as “ spirit of 
the age,” “ spread of civilization," &c. I confine my reading 
to a quarter or half hour per day in skimming through the 
back volumes of the Annals and Magazines of Natural Hist- 
ory, and find much that interests me. I miss my climbing 
plants very much, as I could observe them when very 
poorly.

politics were compared with science even to scientific men ? 
Remember what Trollope says, in ‘Can you Forgive her?’ 
about getting into Parliament, as the highest earthly ambition. 
Jeffrey, in one of his letters, I remember, says that making an 
effective speech in Parliament is a far grander thing than 
writing the grandest history. All this seems to me a poor 
short-sighted view. I cannot tell you how it has rejoiced 
me once again seeing your handwriting — my best of old

Dear Sir, — As I have never studied the science of lan-

resist the pleasure of telling you what interest and pleasure I 
have derived from hearing read aloud your volume.f 

I formerly read Max Muller, and thought his theory (if it 
deserves to be called so) both obscure and weak ; and now, 
after hearing what you say, I feel sure that this is the case, 
and that your cause will ultimately triumph. My indirect 
interest in your book has been increased from Mr. Hensleigh

No one could dissent from my views on the modification of 
species with more courtesy than you da But from the tenor 
of your mind I feel an entire and comfortable conviction 
(and which cannot possibly be disturbed) that if your studies 
led you to attend much to general questions in natural 
history you would come to the same conclusion that I have 
done. 

Have you ever read Huxley’s little book of Lectures? 
I would gladly send you a copy if you think you would 
read it 

Considering what Geology teaches us, the argument from 
the supposed immutability of specific types seems to me 
much the same as if, in a nation which had no old writings, 
some wise old savage was to say that his language had never 
changed ; but my metaphor is too long to fill up. 

Pray believe me, dear Sir, yours very sincerely obliged, 

C. Darwin. 



1866. 

[The year 1866 is given in my father’s Diary in the fol- 
lowing words : — 

“ Continued correcting chapters of ‘ Domestic Animals.’ 

March 1st . — Began on 4th edition of ‘ Origin ’ of 1250 
copies (received for it £238), making 7500 copies altogether.

He was in London on two occasions for a week at a time, 
staying with his brother, and for a few days (May 29th- 
June 2nd) in Surrey ; for the rest of the year he was at 
Down.

1866.] 

There seems to have been a gradual amendment in his 
health ; thus he wrote to Mr. Wallace (January 1866) : — “ My 
health is so far improved that I am able to work one or two 
hours a day.” 

With respect to the 4th edition he wrote to Sir J. D. 
Hooker : — 

“The new edition of the ‘Origin’ has caused me two 
great vexations. I forgot Bates’s paper on variation* but I 
remembered in time his mimetic work, and now, strange to 
say, I find I have forgotten your Arctic paper 1 I know how 
it arose ; I indexed for my bigger work, and never expected 
that a new edition of the ‘ Origin ’ would be wanted. 

“I cannot say how all this has vexed me. Everything 
which I have read during the last four years I find is quite 
washy in my mind.” As far as I know, Mr. Bates’s paper 
was not mentioned in the later editions of the ‘Origin,’ 
for what reason I cannot say. 

In connection with his work on ‘The Variation of 
Animals and Plants,’ I give here extracts from three letters 
addressed to Mr. Huxley, which are of interest as giving 
some idea of the development of the theory of ‘ Pangenesis,’ 
ultimately published in 1868 in the book in question :]

from one so hard worked as you are. It is to read thirty 
pages of MS., excellently copied out, and give me, not length- 
ened criticism, but your opinion whether I may venture to 
publish it You may keep the MS. for a month or two. 
I would not ask this favour, but I really know no one else 
whose judgment on the subject would be final with me.

[1866. 



The case stands thus : in my next book I shall publish 
long chapters on bud- and seminal-variation, on inheritance, 
reversion, effects of use and disuse, &c. I have also for many 
years speculated on the different forms of reproduction. 
Hence it has come to be a passion with me to try to connect 
all such facts by some sort of hypothesis. The MS. which I 
wish to send you gives such a hypothesis ; it is a very rash 
and crude hypothesis, yet it has been a considerable relief to 
my mind, and I can hang on it a good many groups of facts. 
I well know that a mere hypothesis, and this is nothing more, 
is of little value ; but it is very useful to me as serving as a 
kind of summary for certain chapters. Now I earnestly wish 
for your verdict given briefly as, “ Bum it ” — or, which is the 
most favourable verdict I can hope for, “It does rudely 
connect together certain facts, and I do not think it will 
immediately pass out of my mind.” If you can say this 
much, and you do not think it absolutely ridiculous, I shall 
publish it in my concluding chapter. Now will you grant 
me this favour? You must refuse if you are too much over- 
worked. 

I must say for myself that I am a hero to expose my 
hypothesis to the fiery ordeal of your criticism. 

July ii, [1865?] 

My DEAR Huxley, — I thank you most sincerely for having 
so carefully considered my MS. It has been a real act of 
kindness. It would have annoyed me extremely to have 
re-published Buffon’s views, which I did not know of, but I 
will get the book; and if I have strength I will also read 
Bonnet. I do not doubt your judgment is perfectly just, 
and I will try to persuade myself not to publish. The whole 
affair is much too speculative ; yet I think some such view 
will have to be adopted, when I call to mind such facts as 
the inherited effects of use and disuse, &c. But I will try to 
be cautious. ...

1866.] 

[1865?] 

My DEAR HUXLEY, — Forgive my writing in pencil, as I 
can do so lying down. I have read Buffon : whole pages 
are laughably like mine. It is surprising how candid it 
makes one to see one’s views in another man's words. I 
am rather ashamed of the whole affair, but not converted 
to a no-belief. What a kindness you have done me with 
your “vulpine sharpness." Nevertheless, there is a funda- 
mental distinction between Buffon’s views and mine. He 
does not suppose that each cell or atom of tissue throws 
off a little bud ; but he supposes that the sap or blood 
includes his “ organic molecules,” which are ready formed, fit 
to nourish each organ, and when this is fully formed, they 
collect to form buds and the sexual elements. It is all 
rubbish to speculate as I have done; yet, if I ever have 
strength to publish my next book, I fear I shall not resist 
“ Pangenesis,” but I assure you I will put it humbly enough. 
The ordinary course of development of beings, such as the 
Echinodermata, in which new organs are formed at quite 
remote spots from the analogous previous parts, seems to me 
extremely difficult to reconcile on any view except the free 
diffusion in the parent of the germs or gemmules of each 
separate new organ : and so in cases of alternate generation. 
But I will not scribble any more. Hearty thanks to you, you 
best of critics and most learned man

C. Darwin to A. R. Wallace. 

Down, July 5 [1866]. 

My DEAR Wallace, — I have been much interested by 
your letter, which is as clear as daylight. I fully agree with 
all that you say on the advantages of H. Spencer’s excellent

expression of “the survival of the fittest.’’* This, however, 
had not occurred to me till reading your letter. It is, however, 
a great objection to this term that it cannot be used as a 
substantive governing a verb ; and that this is a real objection 
I infer from H. Spencer continually using the words, natural 
selection. I formerly thought, probably in an exaggerated 
degree, that it was a great advantage to bring into connection 
natural and artificial selection ; this indeed led me to use a 
term in common, and I still think it some advantage. I wish 
I had received your letter two months ago, for I would have 
worked in “ the survival, &c.,’’ often in the new edition of the 
• Origin,’ which is now almost printed off, and of which I will 
of course send you a copy. I will use the term in my next 
book on Domestic Animals, &c., from which, by the way, I 
plainly see that you expect much too much. The term 
Natural Selection has now been so largely used abroad and 
at home, that I doubt whether it could be given up, and with 
all its faults I should be sorry to see the attempt made. 
Whether it will be rejected must now depend “ on the survival 
of the fittest.” As in time the term must grow intelligible 
the objections to its use will grow weaker and weaker. I 
doubt whether the use of any term would have made the 
subject intelligible to some minds, clear as it is to others; 
for do we not see even to the present day Malthus on Popu- 
lation absurdly misunderstood ? This reflection about Malthus 
has often comforted me when I have been vexed at the mis- 
statement of my views. As for M. Janet, t he is a meta- 
physician, and such gentlemen are so acute that I think they 
often misunderstand common folk. Your criticism on the

Wallace’s, July a, 1866 : “ The term

degree indirect and incorrect, since

double sense * in which I have used Natural Selection is new 
to me and unanswerable ; but my blunder has done no harm, 
for I do not believe that any one, excepting you, has ever 
observed it. Again, I agree that I have said too much about 
“ favourable variations but I am inclined to think that you 
put the opposite side too strongly; if every part of every 
being varied, I do not think we should see the same end, or 
object, gained by such wonderfully diversified means. 

I hope you are enjoying the country, and are in good 
health, and are working hard at your Malay Archipelago book, 
for I will always put this wish in every note I write to you,

work some hours daily. With many thanks for your 
interesting letter,

My DEAR Hooker, — I was very glad to get your note

that you read capitally, and were listened to with profound

and then came such bursts of applause from the audience. 
It was thoroughly enjoyed amid roars of laughter and noise, 
making a most brilliant conclusion.” 

I am rejoiced that you will publish your lecture, and felt sure 
that sooner or later it would come to this, indeed it would 
have been a sin if you had not done so. I am especially 
rejoiced as you give the arguments for occasional transport 
with such perfect fairness ; these will now receive a fair share 
of attention, as coming from you, a professed botanist. Thanks 
also for Grove’s address ; as a whole it strikes me as very 
good and original, but I was disappointed in the part about 
Species ; it dealt in such generalities that it would apply to 
any view or no view in particular. .... 

And now farewell. I do most heartily rejoice at your 
success, and for Grove’s sake at the brilliant success of the 
whole meeting. 

Yours affectionately, 

Charles Darwin.

a mere business one, but was cemented by warm feelings of 
regard on both sides.] 



C. Darwin to Victor Cans. 

Down, November to, 1866. 

MY DEAR SIR, — I thank you for your extremely kind 
letter. I cannot express too strongly my satisfaction that you 
have undertaken the revision of the new edition, and I feel the 
honour which you have conferred on me. I fear that you will 
find the labour considerable, not only on account of the 
additions, but I suspect that Bronn’s translation is very 
defective, at least I have heard complaints on this head from 
quite a large number of persons. It would be a great gratifi- 
cation to me to know that the translation was a really good 
one, such as I have no doubt you will produce. According 
to our English practice* you will be fully justified in entirely 
omitting Bronn’s Appendix, and I shall be very glad of its 
omission. A new edition may be looked at as a new work. 
.... You could add anything of your own that you liked, 
and I should be much pleased. Should you make any 
additions or append notes, it appears to me that Nageli, 
“ Entstehung und Begriff,” &c.,* would be worth noticing, as 
one of the most able pamphlets on the subject. I am, how- 
ever, far from agreeing with him that the acquisition of certain 
characters which appear to be of no service to plants, offers 
any great difficulty, or affords a proof of some innate tendency 
in plants towards perfection. If you intend to notice this 
pamphlet, I should like to write hereafter a little more in 
detail on the subject.

C. Darwin to C. Nageli* 

Down, June 12 [1866]. 

Dear Sir, — I hope you will excuse the liberty which I 
take in writing to you. I have just read, though imperfectly, 
your * Entstehung und Begriff,’ and .have been so greatly 
interested by it, that I have sent it to be translated, as I am 
a poor German scholar. I have just finished a new [4th] 
edition of my ‘ Origin,’ which will be translated into German, 
and my object in writing to you is to say that if you should 
see this edition you would think that I had borrowed from 
you, without acknowledgment, two discussions on the beauty 
of flowers and fruit ; but I assure you every word was printed 
off" before I had opened your pamphlet. Should you like to 
possess a copy of either the German or English new edition, I 
should be proud to send one. I may add, with respect to the 
beauty of flowers, that I have already hinted the same views 
as you hold in my paper on Lythrum. 

Many of your criticisms on my views are the best which I 
have met with, but I could answer some, at least to my own 
satisfaction ; and I regret extremely that I had not read your

pamphlet before printing my new edition.* On one or two 
points, I think, you have a little misunderstood me, though I 
dare say I have not been cautious in expressing myself. The 
remark which has struck me most, is that on the position of 
the leaves not having been acquired through natural selection, 
from not being of any special importance to the plant. I 
well remember being formerly troubled by an analogous 
difficulty, namely, the position of the ovules, their anatropous 
condition, &c. It was owing to forgetfulness that I did not 
notice this difficulty in the ‘Origin.’ Although I can offer 
no explanation of such facts, and only hope to see that they 
may be explained, yet I hardly see how they support the 
doctrine of some law of necessary development, for it is not 
clear to me that a plant, with its leaves placed at some 
particular angle, or with its ovules in some particular position, 
thus stands higher than another plant. But I must apologise 
for troubling you with these remarks. 

As I much wish to possess your photograph, I take the 
liberty of enclosing my own, and with sincere respect I remain, 

Yours faithfully, 

Ch. Darwin.

the sea; for I could not resist, and I muddled my brains 
with diagrams, &c., and specimens, and made out, as might 
have been expected, nothing. Those angles are a most 
wonderful problem and I wish I could see some one give a 
rational explanation of them.” 



To Dr. Asa Gray. 

May 11 [1861]. 

“ If you wish to save me from a miserable death, do tell me 
why the angles of +, f, 4, &c, series occur, and no other 
angles. It is enough to drive the quietest man mad. Did 
you and some mathematician * publish some paper on the 
subject ? Hooker says you did ; where is it ? 



To Dr. Asa Gray. 

[May 31, 1863?] 

“ I have been looking at Nageli’s work on this subject, and 
am astonished to see that the angle is not always the same in 
young shoots when the leaf-buds are first distinguishable, as 
in full-grown branches. This shows, I think, that there must be 
some potent cause for those angles which do occur : I dare 
say there is some explanation as simple as that for the 
angles of the Bees-cells." 

My father also corresponded with Dr. Hubert Airy and 
was interested in his views on the subject, published in the 
Royal Soc. Proceedings, 1873, p. 176. 

We now return to the year 1866. In November, when the 
prosecution of Governor Eyre was dividing England into two 
bitterly opposed parties, he wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker : — 

* Probably my father was think- These papers arc mentioned in the 
ing of Chauncey Wright’s work on Letters of Chauncey Wright.'

the 1 Mathematical Monthly,’ 1859. 



GOVERNOR EYRE. 



1866.] 



"You will shriek at me when you hear that I have just 
subscribed to the Jamaica Committee.” * 

On this subject I quote from a letter of my brother’s : — 
“With respect to Governor Eyre’s conduct in Jamaica, he 
felt strongly that J. S. Mill was right in prosecuting him. I 
remember one evening, at my Uncle’s, we were talking on the 
subject, and as I happened to think it was too strong a 
measure to prosecute Governor Eyre for murder, I made 
some foolish remark about the prosecutors spending the 
surplus of the fund in a dinner. My father turned on me 
almost with fury, and told me, if those were my feelings, I 
had better go back to Southampton ; the inhabitants having 
given a dinner to Governor Eyre on his landing, but with 
which I had had nothing to do." The end of the incident, 
as told by my brother, is so characteristic of my father that I 
cannot resist giving it, though it has no bearing on the point 
at issue. “ Next morning at 7 o’clock, or so, he came into 
my bedroom and sat on my bed, and said that he had not 
been able to sleep, from the thought that he had been so 
angry with me, and after a few more kind words he left me.” 
The same restless desire to correct a disagreeable or in- 
correct impression is well illustrated in a passage which I 
quote from some notes by Rev. J. Brodie Innes : — 

“ Allied to the extreme carefulness of observation was his 
most remarkable truthfulness in all matters. On one occa- 
sion, when a parish meeting had been held on some disputed 
point of no great importance, I was surprised by a visit from 
Mr. Darwin at night. He came to say that, thinking over 
the debate, though what he had said was quite accurate, he 
thought I might have drawn an erroneous conclusion, and he 
would not sleep till he had explained it I believe that if on 
any day some certain fact had come to his knowle dge wh ich 



contradicted his most cherished theories, he

This tallies with my father’s habits, as described by him- 
self. When a difficulty or an objection occurred to him, 
he thought it of paramount importance to make a note of 
it instantly, because he found hostile facts to be especially 
evanescent. 

The same point is illustrated by the following incident, for 
which I am indebted to Mr. Romanes : — 

“ I have always remembered the following little incident as 
a good example of Mr. Darwin’s extreme solicitude on the 
score of accuracy. One evening at Down there was a 
general conversation upon the difficulty of explaining the 
evolution of some of the distinctively human emotions, espe- 
cially those appertaining to the recognition of beauty in 
natural scenery. I suggested a view of my own upon the 
subject, which, depending upon the principle of association, 
required the supposition that a long line of ancestors should 
have inhabited regions, the scenery of which is now re- 
garded as beautiful. Just as I was about to observe that the 
chief difficulty attaching to my hypothesis arose from 
feelings of the sublime (seeing that these are associated with 
awe, and might therefore be expected not to be agreeable), 
Mr. Darwin anticipated the remark, by asking how the 
hypothesis was to meet the case of these feelings. In the 
conversation which followed, he said the occasion in his own 
life, when he was most affected by the emotions of the sublime 
was when he stood upon one of the summits of the Cordillera, 
and surveyed the magnificent prospect all around. It seemed, 
as he quaintly observed, as if his nerves had become fiddle- 
strings, and had all taken to rapidly vibrating. This remark 
was only made incidentally, and the conversation passed into 
some other branch. About an hour afterwards Mr. Darwin 
retired to rest, while I sat up in the smoking-room with one 
of his sons. We continued smoking and talking for several 
hours, when at about one o’clock in the morning the door 
gently opened and Mr. Darwin appeared, in his slippers and

dressing-gown. As nearly as I can remember, the following 
are the words he used : — 

“ ' Since I went to bed I have been thinking over our con- 
versation in the drawing-room, and it has just occurred to me 
that I was wrong in telling you I felt most of the sublime 
when on the top of the Cordillera ; I am quite sure that I 
felt it even more when in the forests of Brazil. I thought it 
best to come and tell you this at once in case I should be 
putting you wrong. I am sure now that I felt most sublime 
in the forests.’ 

“ This was all he had come' to say, and it was evident 
that he had come to do so, because he thought that the fact 
of his feeling ‘ most sublime in forests ’ was more in accord- 
ance with the hypothesis which we had been discussing, than 
the fact which he had previously stated. Now, as no one knew 
better than Mr. Darwin the difference between a speculation 
and a fact, I thought this little exhibition of scientific con- 
scientiousness very noteworthy, where the only question 
concerned was of so highly speculative a character. I should 
not have been so much impressed if he had thought that by 
his temporary failure of memory he had put me on a wrong 
scent in any matter of fact, although even in such a case he 
is the only man I ever knew who would care to get out of 
bed at such a time of night in order to make the correction 
immediately, instead of waiting till next morning. But as 
the correction only had reference to a flimsy hypothesis, 
I certainly was very much impressed by this display of 
character.”]

feeling that he was twice as ingenious and clever as myself, 
but when I feel that he is about a dozen times my superior, 
even in the master art of wriggling, I feel aggrieved. If he 
had trained himself to observe more, even if at the expense, 
by the law of balancement, of some loss of thinking power, he 
would have been a wonderful man. 

.... I am heartily glad you are taking up the Distribution 
of Plants in New Zealand, and suppose it will make part of 
your new book. Your view, as I understand it, that New 
Zealand subsided and formed two or more small islands, and 

then rose again, seems to me extremely probable 

When I puzzled my brains about New Zealand, I remember 
I came to the conclusion, as indeed I state in the ‘ Origin,’ 
that its flora, as well as that of other southern lands, had 
been tinctured by an Antarctic flora, which must have existed 
before the Glacial period. I concluded that New Zealand 
never could have been closely connected with Australia, 
though I supposed it had received some few Australian 
forms by occasional means of transport Is there any 
reason to suppose that New Zealand could have been more 
closely connected with South Australia during the Glacial 
period, when the Eucalypti, &c., might have been driven further 
North? Apparently there remains only the line, which I 
think you suggested, of sunken islands from New Caledonia. 
Please remember that the Edwardsia was certainly drifted 
there by the sea. 

I remember in old days speculating on the amount of life, 
*>. of organic chemical change, at different periods. There 
seems to me one very difficult element in the problem, 
namely, the state of development of the organic beings at 
each period, for I presume that a Flora and Fauna of cellular 
cryptogamic plants, of Protozoa and Radiata would lead to 
much less chemical change than is now going on. But I have 
scribbled enough. 

Yours affectionately, 

Ch. Darwin.

[The following letter is in acknowledgment of Mr. Rivers’ * 
reply to an earlier letter in which my father had asked for 
information on bud-variation. It may find a place here in 
illustration of the manner of my father’s intercourse with 
those “ whose avocations in life had to do with the rearing or 
use of living things ” f — an intercourse which bore such good 
fruit in the ‘ Variation of Animals and Plants.’ Mr. Dyer has 
some excellent remarks on the unexpected value thus placed 
on the apparently trivial facts disinterred from weekly journals, 
or amassed by correspondence. He adds : “ Horticulturists 
who had . . . moulded plants almost at their will, at the 
impulse of taste or profit, were at once amazed and charmed 
to find that they had been doing scientific work, and helping 
to establish a great theory.”]

My dear Sir, — Permit me to thank you cordially for your 
most kind letter. For years I have read with interest every 
scrap which you have written in periodicals, and abstracted in 
MS. your book on Roses, and several times I thought I would 
write to you, but did not know whether you would think me too 
intrusive. I shall, indeed, be truly obliged for any informa- 
tion you can supply me on bud-variation or sports. When 
any extra difficult points occur to me in my present subject 
(which is a mass of difficulties), I will apply to you, but I will 
not be unreasonable. It is most true what you say that any 
one to study well the physiology of the life of plants, ought to 
have under his eye a multitude of plants. I have endeavoured 
to do what I can by comparing statements by many writers 
and observing what I could myself. Unfortunately few have

observed like you have done. As you are so kind, I will 
mention one other point on which I am collecting facts; 
namely, the effect produced on the stock by the graft ; thus, 
it is said, that the purple-leaved filbert affects the leaves of 
the common hazel on which it is grafted (I have just procured 
a plant to try), so variegated jessamine is said to affect 
its stock. I want these facts partly to throw light on the 
marvellous laburnums, Adami-trifacial oranges, &c. That 
laburnum case seems one of the strangest in physiology. 
I have now growing splendid, fertile, yellow laburnums (with 
a long raceme like the so-called Waterer’s laburnum) from 
seed of yellow flowers on the C. Adarni. To a man like 
myself, who is compelled to live a solitary life, and sees 
few persons, it is no slight satisfaction to hear that I have 
been able at all [to] interest by my books observers like 
yourself. 

As I shall publish on my present subject, I presume, 
within a year, it will be of no use your sending me the shoots 
of peaches and nectarines which you so kindly offer ; I have 
recorded your facts. 

Permit me again to thank you cordially ; I have not often 
in my life received a kinder letter.

JANUARY 1867, TO JUNE 1868. 



At the beginning of the year 1867 he was at work on the 
final chapter — “Concluding Remarks” of the ‘Variation of 
Animals and Plants under Domestication,’ which was begun 
after the rest of the MS. had been sent to the printers in the 
preceding December. With regard to the publication of the 
book he wrote to Mr. Murray, on January 3 : — 

“ I cannot tell you how sorry I am to hear of the enormous 
size of my book.* I fear it can never pay. But I cannot 
shorten it now ; nor, indeed, if I had foreseen its length, do 
I see which parts ought to have been omitted. 

“ If you are afraid to publish it, say so at once, I beg you, 
and I will consider your note as cancelled. If you think fit, 
get any one whose judgment you rely on, to look over some 
of the more legible chapters, namely, the Introduction, and 
on dogs and plants, the latter chapters being, in my opinion, 
the dullest in the book. . . . The list of chapters, and the 
inspection of a few here and there, would give a good judge 



• On January 9 he wrote to Sir 
J. D. Hooker : “ I have been these 
last few days vexed and annoyed 
to a foolish degree by hearing that 
my MS. on Dorn. An. and Cult. 
Plants will make 2 vols., both 
bigger than the ‘Origin.’ The 
volumes will have to be full-sized 



octavo, so I have written to Murray 
to suggest details to be printed in 
small type. But I feel that the 
size is quite ludicrous in relation to 
the subject. I am ready to swear 
at myself and at every fool who 
writes a book.”

a fair idea of the whole book. Pray do not publish blindly, 
as it would vex me all my life if I led you to heavy loss." 

Mr. Murray referred the MS. to a literary friend, and, in 
spite of a somewhat adverse opinion, willingly agreed to 
publish the book. My father wrote : — 

“Your note has been a great relief to me. I am rather 
alarmed about the verdict of your friend, as he is not a man 
of science. I think if you had sent the ‘ Origin ’ to an un- 
scientific man, he would have utterly condemned it. I am, 
however, very glad that you have consulted any one on whom 
you can rely. 

“I must add, that my ‘Journal of Researches ’ was seen in 
MS. by an eminent semi-scientific man, and was pronounced 
unfit for publication.” 

The proofs were begun in March, and the last revise was 
finished on November 15th, and during this period the only 
intervals of rest were two visits of a week each at his brother 
Erasmus’s house in Queen Anne Street. He notes in his 
Diary : — 

“I began this book [in the] beginning of i860 (and then 
had some MS.), but owing to interruptions from my illness, 
and illness of children ; from various editions of the ‘ Origin,’ 
and Papers, especially Orchis book and Tendrils, I have 
spent four years and two months over it” 

The edition of ‘Animals and Plants’ was of 1500 copies, 
and of these 1260 were sold at Mr. Murray’s autumnal sale, 
but it was not published until January 30, 1868. A new 
edition of 1250 copies was printed in February of the same year. 

In 1867 he received the distinction of being made a 
knight of the Prussian Order “ Pour le Mdrite.” * He seems

not to have known how great the distinction was, for in June 
1868 he wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker : — 

“ What a man you are for sympathy. I was made “ Eques ” 
some months ago, but did not think much about it Now, by 
Jove, we all do ; but you, in fact, have knighted me.” 

The letters may now take up the story.] 

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, February 8 [1867]. 

My dear Hooker, — I am heartily glad that you have 
been offered the Presidentship of the British Association, for 
it is a great honour, and as you have so much work to do, 
I am equally glad that you have declined it I feel, however, 
convinced that you would have succeeded very well ; but if 
I fancy myself in such a position, it actually makes my blood 
run cold. I look back with amazement at the skill and taste 
with which the Duke of Argyll made a multitude of little 
speeches at Glasgow. By the way, I have not seen the 
Duke’s book,* but I formerly thought that some of the 
articles which appeared in periodicals were very clever, but 
not very profound. One of these was reviewed in the Satur- 
day Review t some years ago, and the fallacy of some main 
argument was admirably exposed, and I sent the article to 
you, and you agreed strongly with it. . , . There was the 
other day a rather good review of the Duke’s book in the 



ship. Faraday, Herschel, and 
Thomas Moore have belonged to 
it in this way. From the thirty 
members a chancellor is elected by 
the king (the first officer of this 
kind was Alexander v. Humboldt) ; 
and it is the duty of the chancellor 
to notify a vacancy in the Order to 
the remainder of the thirty, who 



then elect by vote the new member 
— but the king has technically the 
appointment in his own hands.

Spectator, and with a new explanation, either by the Duke or 
the reviewer (I could not make out which), of rudimentary 
organs, namely, that economy of labour and material was 
a great guiding principle with God (ignoring waste of seed 
and of young monsters, &c.), and that making a new plan for 
the structure of animals was thought, and thought was labour, 
and therefore God kept to a uniform plan, and left rudiments. 
This is no exaggeration. In short, God is a man, rather 
cleverer than us. . . . Iam very much obliged for the Nation 
(returned by this post) ; it is admirably good. You say I 
always guess wrong, but I do not believe any one, except Asa 
Gray, could have done the thing so well. I would bet even, 
or three to two, that it is Asa Gray, though one or two 
passages staggered me. 

I finish my book on ‘ Domestic Animals,’ &c., by a single 
paragraph, answering, or rather throwing doubt, in so far as 
so little space permits, on Asa Gray’s doctrine that each 
variation has been specially ordered or led along a beneficial 
line. It is foolish to touch such subjects, but there have been 
so many allusions to what I think about the part which God 
has played in the formation of organic beings,* that I thought 
it shabby to evade the question. ... I have even received 
several letters on the subject. ... I overlooked your sen- 
tence about Providence, and suppose I treated it as Buckland 
did his own theology, when his Bridgewater Treatise was 
read aloud to him for correction. . . , 



* Prof. Judd allows me to quote 
from some notes which he has 
kindly given me : — “ Lyell once 
told me that he had frequently been 
asked if Darwin was not one of the 
most unhappy of men, it being 
suggested that his outrage upon 
public opinion should have filled 
him with remorse.” Sir Charles 
must have been able, I think, to 



give a conclusive answer on this 
point. Professor J udd continues 
“ I made a note of this and other 
conversations of Lyell’s at the time. 
At the present time such statements 
must appear strange to any one who 
does not recollect the revolution in 
opinion which has taken place 
during the last 23 years [1882].”

1867.] EVOLUTION AND RELIGION. 63 

[The following letter, from Mrs. Boole, is one of those 
referred to in the last letter to Sir J. D. Hooker :] 

Dear Sir, — Will you excuse my venturing to ask you a 
question, to which no one’s answer but your own would be 
quite satisfactory ? 

Do you consider the holding of your theory of Natural 
Selection, in its fullest and most unreserved sense, to be 
inconsistent — I do not say with any particular scheme of 
theological doctrine — but with the following belief, namely : — 

That knowledge is given to man by the direct inspiration 
of the Spirit of God. 

That God is a personal and Infinitely good Being. 

That the effect of the action of the Spirit of God on the 
brain of man is especially a moral effect. 

And that each individual man has within certain limits 
a power of choice as to how far he will yield to his hereditary 
animal impulses, and how far he will rather follow the 
guidance of the Spirit, who is educating him into a power of 
resisting those impulses in obedience to moral motives ? 

The reason why I ask you is this : my own impression has 
always been, not only that your theory was perfectly com- 
patible with the faith to which I have just tried to give 
expression, but that your books afforded me a clue which 
would guide me in applying that faith to the solution of 
certain complicated psychological problems which it was 
of practical importance to me as a mother to solve. I felt 
that you had supplied one of the missing links — not to say 
the missing link — between the facts of science and the pro- 
mises of religion. Every year's experience tends to deepen 
in me that impression. 

But I have lately read remarks on the probable bearing of 
your theory on religious and moral questions which have 
perplexed and pained me sorely. I know that the persons 
who make such remarks must be cleverer and wiser than

myself. I cannot feel sure that they are mistaken, unless 
you will tell me so. And I think — T cannot know for certain 
— but I think — that if I were an author, I would rather that 
the humblest student of my works should apply to me 
directly in a difficulty, than that she should puzzle too long 
over adverse and probably mistaken or thoughtless criticisms. 

At the same time I feel that you have a perfect right to 
refuse to answer such questions as I have asked you. Science 
must take her path, and Theology hers, and they will meet 
when and where and how God pleases, and you are in no 
sense responsible for it if the meeting-point should still be 
very far off. If I receive no answer to this letter I shall infer 
nothing from your silence, except that you felt I had no right 
to make such inquiries of a stranger. 

[My father replied as follows :] 

Down, December 14, 1866. 

Dear Madam, — It Would have gratified me much if I 
could have sent satisfactory answers to your questions, or, 
indeed, answers of any kind. But I cannot see how the 
belief that all organic beings, including man, have been genet- 
ically derived from some simple being, instead of having been 
separately created, bears on your difficulties. These, as it 
seems to me, can be answered only by widely different evi- 
dence from science, or by the so-called “ inner consciousness.” 
My opinion is not worth more than that of any other man 
who has thought on such subjects, and it would be folly in 
me to give it. I may, however, remark that it has always ap- 
peared to me more satisfactory to look at the immense amount 
of pain and suffering in this world as the inevitable result of the 
natural sequence of events, i.e. general laws, rather than from 
the direct intervention of God, though I am aware this is not 
logical with reference to an omniscient Deity. Your last 
question seems to resolve itself into the problem of free will 
and necessity, which has been found by most persons insoluble

I sincerely wish that this note had not been as utterly 
valueless as it is. I would have sent full answers, though 
I have little time or strength to spare, had it been in my 
power. 

I have the honour to remain, dear Madam, 

Yours very faithfully, 

Charles Darwin. 

P.S. — I am grieved that my views should incidentally have 
caused trouble to your mind, but I thank you for your judg- 
ment, and honour you for it, that theology and science 
should each run its own course, and that in the present case 
I am not responsible if their meeting-point should still be 
far off. 

[The next letter discusses the ‘ Reign of Law,’ referred to 
a few pages back :] 

C. Darwin to C. Lyell. 

Down, June I [1867]. 

... I am at present reading the Duke, and am very much 
interested by him ; yet I cannot but think, clever as the whole 
is, that parts arc weak, as when he doubts whether each curva- 
ture of the beak of humming-birds is of service to each species. 
He admits, perhaps too fully, that I have shown the use of 
each little ridge and shape of each petal in orchids, and 
how strange he does not extend the view to humming-birds. 
Still odder, it seems to me, all that he says on beauty, which 
I should have thought a nonentity, except in the mind of 
some sentient being. He might have as well said that love 
existed during the secondary or Palaeozoic periods. I hope 
you are getting on with your book better than I am with 
mine, which kills me with the labour of correcting, and is 
intolerably dull, though I did not think so when I was writing 
it A naturalist’s life would be a happy one if he had only to 
observe, and never to write.

lation of the * Origin,’ undertaken by Professor Carus :] 

C. Darwin to J. Victor Carus. 

Down, February 17 [1867]. 

My DEAR Sir, — I have read your preface with care. It 
seems to me that you have treated Bronn with complete 
respect and great delicacy, and that you have alluded to your 
own labour with much modesty. I do not think that any of 
Bronn’s friends can complain of what you say and what you 
have done. For my own sake, I grieve that you have not 
added notes, as I am sure that I should have profited much 
by them ; but as you have omitted Bronn’s objections, I 
believe that you have acted with excellent judgment and 
fairness in leaving the text without comment to the inde- 
pendent verdict of the reader. I heartily congratulate you 
that the main part of your labour is over ; it would have been 
to most men a very troublesome task, but you seem to have 
indomitable powers of work, judging from those two wonder- 
ful and most useful volumes on zoological literature* edited 
by you, and which I never open without surprise at their ac- 
curacy, and gratitude for their usefulness. I cannot sufficiently 
tell you how much I rejoice that you were persuaded to super- 
intend the translation of the present edition of my book, for I 
have now the great satisfaction of knowing that the German 
public can judge fairly of its merits and demerits. .... 

With my cordial and sincere thanks, believe me, 

My dear Sir, yours very faithfully, 

Ch. Darwin.

PROFESSOR HAECKEL. 



6 7 



[The earliest letter which I have seen from my father to 
Professor Haeckel, was written in 1865, and from that time 
forward they corresponded (though not, I think, with any 
regularity) up to the end of my father's life. His friendship 
with Haeckel was not merely growth of correspondence, as 
was the case with some others, for instance, Fritz Muller. 
Haeckel paid more than one visit to Down, and these were 
thoroughly enjoyed by my father. The following letter will 
serve to show the strong feeling of regard which he enter- 
tained for his correspondent — a feeling which I have often 
heard him emphatically express, and which was warmly 
returned. The book referred to is Haeckel’s ‘Generelle 
Morphologie,’ published in 1866, a copy of which my father 
received from the author in January 1867. 

Dr. E. Krause * has given a good account of Professor 
Haeckel’s services to the cause of Evolution. After speak- 
ing of the lukewarm reception which the ‘ Origin ’ met with in 
Germany on its first publication, he goes on to describe the 
first adherents of the new faith as more or less popular 
writers, not especially likely to advance its acceptance with 
the professorial or purely scientific world. And he claims for 
Haeckel that it was his advocacy of Evolution in his * Radio- 
laria’ (1862), and at the “ Versammlung” of Naturalists at 
Stettin in 1863, that placed the Darwinian question for the 
first time publicly before the forum of German science, and 
his enthusiastic propagandism that chiefly contributed to its 
success. 

Mr. Huxley, writing in 1869, paid a high tribute to 
Professor Haeckel as the Coryphaeus of the Darwinian move- 
ment in Germany. Of his * Generelle Morphologie,’ “ an 
attempt to work out the practical applications ” of the doctrine 
of Evolution to their final results, he says that it has the 
“force and suggestiveness, and . . . systematising power 
of Oken without his extravagance." Professor Huxley also 
• ‘ Charles Darwin und sein Verhaltniss zu Deutschland,’ 1885. 



© The Complete Work of Charles Darwin Online 



‘VARIATION UNDER DOMESTICATION.’ [1867. 



testifies to the value of Haeckel’s ‘ Schopfungs-Geschichte ’ as 
an exposition of the ‘ Generelle Morphologie ’ “ for an educated 
public.” 

Again, in his ‘ Evolution in Biology,’ • Mr. Huxley wrote : 
“ Whatever hesitation may, not unfrequently, be felt by less 
daring minds, in following Haeckel in many of his specula- 
tions, his attempt to systematise the doctrine of Evolution, 
and to exhibit its influence as the central thought of modem 
biology, cannot fail to have a far-reaching influence on the 
progress of science.” 

In the following letter my father alludes to the somewhat 
fierce manner in which Professor Haeckel fought the battle of 
‘ Darwinismus,’ and on this subject Dr. Krause has some good 
remarks (p. 162). He asks whether much that happened in 
the heat of the conflict might not well have been otherwise, 
and adds that Haeckel himself is the last man to deny this. 
Nevertheless he thinks that even these things may have worked 
well for the cause of Evolution, inasmuch as Haeckel “con- 
centrated on himself by his ‘ Ursprung des Menschen- 
Geschlechts,’ his ‘ Generelle Morphologie,’ and * Schopfungs- 
Geschichte,’ all the hatred and bitterness which Evolution 
excited in certain quarters,” so that, “ in a surprisingly short 
time it became the fashion in Germany that Haeckel alone 
should be abused, while Darwin was held up as the ideal of 
forethought and moderation."] 

C. Darwin to E. Haeckel. 

Down, May 21, 1867. 

Dear Haeckel. — -Your letter of the 18th has given me 
great pleasure, for you have received what I said in the most 
kind and cordial manner. You have in part taken what I 
said much stronger than I had intended. It never occurred 
to me for a moment to doubt that your work, with the whole

subject so admirably and clearly arranged, as well as fortified 
by so many new facts and arguments, would not advance our 
common object in the highest degree. All that I think is 
that you will excite anger, and that anger so completely 
blinds every one, that your arguments would have no chance 
of influencing those who are already opposed to our views. 
Moreover, I do not at all like that you, towards whom I feel 
so much friendship, should unnecessarily make enemies, and 
there is pain and vexation enough in the world without more 
being caused. But I repeat that I can feel no doubt that 
your work will greatly advance our subject, and I heartily 
wish it could be translated into English, for my own sake and 
that of others. With respect to what you say about my 
advancing too strongly objections against my own views, some 
of my English friends think that I have erred on this side ; 
but truth compelled me to write what I did, and I am inclined 
to think it was good policy. The belief in the descent theory 
is slowly spreading in England,* even amongst those who can 
give no reason for their belief. No body of men were at first 
so much opposed to my views as the members of the London 
Entomological Society, but now I am assured that, with the 
exception of two or three old men, all the members concur 
with me to a certain extent. It has been a great disappoint- 
ment to me that I have never received your long letter written 
to me from the Canary Islands. I am rejoiced to hear that 
your tour, which seems to have been a most interesting one, 
has done your health much good. I am working away at my 
new book, but make very slow progress, and the work tries my 
health, which is much the same as when you were here.

translation, I am rather doubtful. I am very glad to hear 
that there is some chance of your visiting England this 
autumn, and all in this house will be delighted to see you

Charles Darwin. 

C. Darwin to F. Muller. 

Down, July 31 [1867]. 

My DEAR Sir, — I received a week ago your letter of 
June 2, full as usual of valuable matter and specimens. It 
arrived at exactly the right time, for I was enabled to give 
a pretty full abstract of your observations on the plant’s 
own pollen being poisonous. I have inserted this abstract 
in the proof-sheets in my chapter on sterility, and it forms 
the most striking part of my whole chapter* I thank 
you very sincerely for the most interesting observations, 
which, however, I regret that you did not publish inde- 
pendently. I have been forced to abbreviate one or two 
parts more than I wished . . . Your letters always surprise 
me, from the number of points to which you attend. I wish 
I could make my letters of any interest to you, for I hardly 
ever see a naturalist, and live as retired a life as you in 
Brazil. With respect to mimetic plants, I remember Hooker 
many years ago saying he believed that there were many, but I 
agree with you that it would be most difficult to distinguish 
between mimetic resemblance and the effects of peculiar con- 
ditions. Who can say to which of these causes to attribute 
the several plants with heath-like foliage at the Cape of Good 
Hope? Is it not also a difficulty that quadrupeds appear to 
recognise plants more by their [scent] than their appearance?

MIMICRY. 



What I have just said reminds me to ask you a question. 
Sir J. Lubbock brought me the other day what appears to be 
a terrestrial Planaria (the first ever found in the northern 
hemisphere) and which was coloured exactly like our dark- 
coloured slugs. Now slugs are not devoured by birds, like 
the shell-bearing species, and this made me remember that I 
found the Brazilian Planariae actually together with striped 
Vaginuli which I believe were similarly coloured. Can you 
throw any light on this? I wish to know, because I was 
puzzled some months ago how it would be possible to account 
for the bright colours of the Planariae in reference to sexual 
selection. By the way, I suppose they are hermaphrodites. 

Do not forget to aid me, if in your power, with answers to 
any of my questions on expression, for the subject interests 
me greatly. With cordial thanks for your never-failing kind- 
ness, believe me, 

Yours very sincerely, 

Charles Darwin. 

C. Darwin to C. Lyell. 

Down, July x8 [1867]. 

My DEAR Lyell, — Many thanks for your long letter. I 
am sorry to hear that you are in despair about your book ; * 
I well know that feeling, but am now getting out of the lower 
depths. I shall be very much pleased, if you can make the 
least use of my present book, and do not care at all whether 
it is published before yours. Mine will appear towards the 
end of November of this year ; you speak of yours as not 
coming out till November, 1868, which I hope may bean error. 
There is nothing about Man in my book which can interfere 
with you, so I will order all the completed clean sheets to be 
sent (and others as soon as ready) to you, but please observe 
you will not care for the first volume, which is a mere record

of the amount of variation ; but I hope the second will be 
somewhat more interesting. Though I fear the whole must 
be dull. 

I rejoice from my heart that you are going to speak out 
plainly about species. My book about Man, if published, will 
be short, and a large portion will be devoted to sexual selec- 
tion, to which subject I alluded in the ‘ Origin ’ as bearing on 
Man. . . . 



C. Darwin to C. Lyell. 

Down, August 22 [1867]. 

My DEAR Lyell, — I thank you cordially for your last two 
letters. The former one did me real good, for I had got so 
wearied with the subject that I could hardly bear to correct 
the proofs,* and you gave me fresh heart. I remember 
thinking that when you came to the Pigeon chapter you 
would pass it over as quite unreadable. Your last letter has 
interested me in very many ways, and I have been glad to 
hear about those horrid unbelieving Frenchmen. I have been 
particularly pleased that you have noticed Pangenesis. I do 
not know whether you ever had the feeling of having thought 
so much over a subject that you had lost all power of judging 
it This is my case with Pangenesis (which is 26 or 27 years 
old), but I am inclined to think that if it be admitted as a 
probable hypothesis it will be a somewhat important step in 
Biology. 

I cannot help still regretting that you have ever looked at 
the slips, for I hope to improve the whole a good deal. It is 
surprising to me, and delightful, that you should care in the 
least about the plants. Altogether you have given me one of 
the best cordials I ever had in my life, and I heartily thank 
you. I despatched this morning the French edition.f The

C. Darwin to Asa Gray. 

Down, October 16 [1867]. 

My dear Gray, — I send by this post clean sheets of 
Vol. I. up to p. 336, and there are only 41 1 pages in this vol. 
I am very glad to hear that you are going to review my book ; 
but if the Nation * is a newspaper I wish it were at the 
bottom of the sea, for I fear that you will thus be stopped 
reviewing me in a scientific journal. The first volume is all 
details, and you will not be able to read it ; and you must 
remember that the chapters on plants are written for natural- 
ists who are not botanists. The last chapter in Vol. I. is, 
however, I think, a curious compilation of facts ; it is on bud- 
variation. In Vol. II. some of the chapters are more interest- 
ing ; and I shall be very curious to hear your verdict on the 
chapter on close inter-breeding. The chapter on what I call 
Pangenesis will be called a mad dream, and I shall be pretty 
well satisfied if you think it a dream worth publishing ; but 
at the bottom of my own mind I think it contains a great 
truth. I finish my book with a semi-theological paragraph, 
in which I quote and differ from you ; what you will think of 
it, I know not. . . .

‘VARIATION UNDER DOMESTICATION.’ [1867. 



C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, November 17 [1867]. 

My DEAR Hooker,— Congratulate me, for I have finished 
the last revise of the last sheet of my book. It has been an 
awful job : seven and a half months correcting the press : the 
book, from much small type, does not look big, but is really 
very big. I have had hard work to keep up to the mark, but 
during the last week only few revises came, so that I have 
rested and feel more myself. Hence, after our long mutual 
silence, I enjoy myself by writing a note to you, for the sake 
of exhaling, and hearing from you. On account of the 
index,* I do not suppose that you will receive your copy till 
the middle of next month. I shall be intensely anxious to 
hear what you think about Pangenesis ; though I can see how 
fearfully imperfect, even in mere conjectural conclusions, it is ; 
yet it has been an infinite satisfaction to me somehow to 
connect the various large groups of facts, which I have long 
considered, by an intelligible thread. I shall not be at all 
surprised if you attack it and me with unparalleled ferocity. 
It will be my endeavour to do as little as possible for some time, 
but [I] shall soon prepare a paper or two for the Linnean 
Society. In a short time we shall go to London for ten 
days, but the time is not yet fixed. Now I have told you a 
deal about myself, and do let me hear a good deal about your 
own past and future doings. Can you pay us a visit, early in 
December ? .... I have seen no one for an age, and heard 
no news. 

. . . About my book I will give you a bit of advice. Skip 
the whole of Vol. I., except the last chapter (and that need 
only be skimmed) and skip largely in the 2nd volume ; and 
then you will say it is a very good book. 

* The index was made by Mr. my father express his admiration 
W. S. Dallas ; I have often heard of this excellent piece of work.

1868. 

[‘The Variation of Animals and Plants’ was, as already 
mentioned, published on January 30, 1868, and on that day 
he sent a copy to Fritz Muller, and wrote to him : — 

“ I send by this post, by French packet, my new book, the 
publication of which has been much delayed. The greater 
part, as you will see, is not meant to be read ; but I should 
very much like to hear what you think of ‘Pangenesis,’ 
though I fear it will appear to every one far too speculative.”] 

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

February 3 [1868]. 

... I am very much pleased at what you say about my 
Introduction ; after it was in type I was as near as possible 
cancelling the whole. I have been for some time in despair 
about my book, and if I try to read a few pages I feel fairly 
nauseated, but do not let this make you praise it ; for I have 
made up my mind that it is not worth a fifth part of the 
enormous labour it has cost me. I assure you that all that is 
worth your doing (if you have time for so much) is glancing 
at Chapter VI, and reading parts of the later chapters. 
The facts on self-impotent plants seem to me curious, and I 
have worked out to my own satisfaction the good from cross- 
ing and evil from interbreeding. I did read Pangenesis the 
other evening, but even this, my beloved child, as I had 
fancied, quite disgusted me. The devil take the whole book ; 
and yet now I am at work again as hard as I am able. It is 
really a great evil that from habit I have pleasure in hardly 
anything except Natural History, for nothing else makes me 
forget my ever-recurrent uncomfortable sensations. But I 
must not howl any more, and the critics may say what they 
like ; I did my best, and man can do no more. What a 
splendid pursuit Natural History would be if it was all 
observing and no writing ! . . . .

‘VARIATION UNDER DOMESTICATION.’ [1868. 



C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, February 10 [1868]. 

My DEAR Hooker, — What is the good of having a friend, 
if one may not boast to him ? I heard yesterday that Murray 
has sold in a week the whole edition of 1500 copies of my 
book, and the sale so pressing that he has agreed with Clowes 
to get another edition in fourteen days ! This has done me a 
world of good, for I had got into a sort of dogged hatred of 
my book. And now there has appeared a review in the Pall 
Mall which has pleased me excessively, more perhaps than is 
reasonable. I am quite content, and do not care how much I 
may be pitched into. If by any chance you should hear who 
wrote the article in the Pall Mall, do please tell me ; it is 
some one who writes capitally, and who knows the subject 
I went to luncheon on Sunday, to Lubbock’s, partly in hopes 
of seeing you, and, be hanged to you, you were not there. 

Your cock-a-hoop friend, 

C. D. 

[Independently of the favourable tone of the able series of 
notices in the Pall Mall Gazette (Feb. 10, 15, 17, 1868), my 
father may well have been gratified by the following passages:— 
“ We must call attention to the rare and noble calmness with 
which he expounds his own views, undisturbed by the heats 
of polemical agitation which those views have excited, and 
persistently refusing to retort on his antagonists by ridicule, 
by indignation, or by contempt. Considering the amount of 
vituperation and insinuation which has come from the other 
side, this forbearance is supremely dignified.’’ 

And again in the third notice, Feb. 17 : — 

“ Nowhere has the author a word that could wound the most 
sensitive self-love of an antagonist ; nowhere does he, in text 
or note, expose the fallacies and mistakes of brother investi- 
gators . . . but while abstaining from impertinent censure,

he is lavish in acknowledging the smallest debts he may owe ; 
and his book will make many men happy." 

I am indebted to Messrs. Smith & Elder for the informa- 
tion that these articles were written by Mr. G. H. Lewes.] 



C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, February 23 [1868]. 

My DEAR HOOKER, — I have had almost as many letters 
to write of late as you can have, viz. from 8 to 10 per diem, 
chiefly getting up facts on sexual selection, therefore I have 
felt no inclination to write to you, and now I mean to write 
solely about my book for my own satisfaction, and not at all for 
yours. The first edition was 1 500 copies, and now the second 
is printed off ; sharp work. Did you look at the review in the 
Athenanm* showing profound contempt of me ? ... It is a 
shame that he should have said that I have taken much from 
Pouchet, without acknowledgment ; for I took literally nothing, 
there being nothing to take. There is a capital review in the 
Gardeners' Chronicle, which will sell the book if anything will. 



• Athenrum, February 15, 1868. 
My father quoted Pouchet’s asser- 
tion that “variation under domes- 
tication throws no light on the 
natural modification of species.” 
The reviewer quotes the end of 
a passage in which my father de- 
clares that he can see no force 
in Pouchet’s arguments, or rather 
assertions, and then goes on : “We 
are sadly mistaken if there are not 
clear proofs in the pages of the 
book before us that, on the contrary, 
Mr. Darwin has perceived, felt, and 
yielded to the force of the argu- 

antagonist.” The following may 
serve as samples of the rest of the

have a better illustration of anti- 
climax than the mountain which 
brought forth a mouse, ... in the

“A few summary words. On 
the ‘ Origin of Species ’ Mr. Dar- 
win has nothing, and is never likely 
to have anything, to say ; but on the 
vastly important subject of inheri- 
tance, the transmission of pecu- 
liarities once acquired through 
successive generations, this work

78 ‘VARIATION UNDER DOMESTICATION.’ [1868. 

I don’t quite see whether I or the writer is in a muddle about 
man causing variability. If a man drops a bit of iron into 
sulphuric acid he does not cause the affinities to come into 
play, yet he may be said to make sulphate of iron. I do not 
know how to avoid ambiguity. 

After what the Pall Mall Gazette and the Chronicle have 
said, I do not care a d — . 

I fear Pangenesis is stillborn ; Bates says he has read it 
twice, and is not sure that he understands it. H. Spencer 
says the view is quite different from his (and this is a great 
relief to me, as I feared to be accused of plagiarism, but 
utterly failed to be sure what he meant, so thought it safest 
to give my view as almost the same as his), and he says he is 
not sure he understands it . . . Am I not a poor devil ? yet I 
took such pains, I must think that I expressed myself clearly. 
Old Sir H. Holland says he has read it twice, and thinks it 
very tough ; but believes that sooner or later “ some view 
akin to it ” will be accepted. 

You will think me very self-sufficient, when I declare that I 
feel sure if Pangenesis is now stillborn it will, thank God, 
at some future time reappear, begotten by some other father, 
and christened by some other name. 

Have you ever met with any tangible and clear view of 
what takes place in generation, whether by seeds or buds, or 
how a long-lost character can possibly reappear ; or how the 
male element can possibly affect the mother plant, or the 
mother animal, so that her future progeny are affected ? Now 
all these points and many others are connected together, 
whether truly or falsely is another question, by Pangenesis. 
You see I die hard, and stick up for my poor child. 

This letter is written for my own satisfaction, and not for 
yours. So bear it. 

Yours affectionately, 

Ch. Darwin.

C. Darwin to A. Newton * 

Down, February 9 [1870]. 

Dear Newton, — I suppose it would be universally held 
extremely wrong for a defendant to write to a Judge to 
express his satisfaction at a judgment in his favour ; and yet 
I am going thus to act. I have just read what you have said 
in the ‘ Record ’ f about my pigeon chapters, and it has gratified 
me beyond measure. I have sometimes felt a little dis- 
appointed that the labour of so many years seemed to be 
almost thrown away, for you are the first man capable of 
forming a judgment (excepting partly Quatrefages), who 
seems to have thought anything of this part of my work. 
The amount of labour, correspondence, and care, which the 
subject cost me, is more than you could well suppose. I 
thought the article in the Atheticemn was very unjust; but 
now I feel amply repaid, and I cordially thank you for your 
sympathy and too warm praise. What labour you have 
bestowed on your part of the ' Record ’ ! I ought to be ashamed 
to speak of my amount of work. I thoroughly enjoyed the 
Sunday which you and the others spent here, and 

I remain, dear Newton, yours very sincerely, 

Ch. Darwin.

think that the hypothesis is little more than saying that 
organisms have such and such potentialities. What you

say exactly and fully expresses my feeling, viz. that it 
is a relief to have some feasible explanation of the various 
facts, which can be given up as soon as any better hypo- 
thesis is found. It has certainly been an immense relief 
to my mind ; for I have been stumbling over the subject for 
years, dimly seeing that some relation existed between the 
various classes of facts. I now hear from H. Spencer that his 
views quoted in my foot-note refer to something quite distinct, 
as you seem to have perceived. 

I shall be very glad to hear at some future day your criti- 
cisms on the "causes of variability.” Indeed I feel sure that 
I am right about sterility and natural selection. . . . I do not 
quite understand your case, and we think that a word or two 
is misplaced. I wish some time you would consider the case 
under the following point of view : — If sterility is caused or 
accumulated through natural selection, then as every degree 
exists up to absolute barrenness, natural selection must have 
the power of increasing it. Now take two species, A and B, 
and assume that they are (by any means) half-sterile, i.e. 
produce half the full number of offspring. Now try and make 
(by natural selection) A and B absolutely sterile when 
crossed, and you will find how difficult it is. I grant, indeed 
it is certain, that the degree of sterility of the individuals A 
and B will vary, but any such extra-sterile individuals of, we 
will say A, if they should hereafter breed with other indi- 
viduals of A, will bequeath no advantage to their progeny, by 
which these families will tend to increase in number over 
other families of A, which are not more sterile when crossed 
with B. But I do not know that I have made this any 
clearer than in the chapter in my book. It is a most difficult 
bit of reasoning, which I have gone over and over again on 
paper with diagrams. 

. . . Hearty thanks for your letter. You have indeed 
pleased me, for I had given up the great god Pan as a still- 
born deity. I wish you could be induced to make it clear,

with your admirable powers of elucidation, in one of the 
scientific journals. . . . 



C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, February 28 [1868]. 

My dear Hooker,— I have been deeply interested by 
your letter, and we had a good laugh over Huxley’s remark, 
which was so deuced clever that you could not recollect it. I 
cannot quite follow your train of thought, for in the last page 
you admit all that I wish, having apparently denied all, or 
thought all mere words in the previous pages of your note ; 
but it may be my muddle. I see clearly that any satisfaction 
which Pan may give will depend on the constitution of each 
man’s mind. If you have arrived already at any similar 
conclusion, the whole will of course appear stale to you. I 
heard yesterday from Wallace, who says (excuse horrid 
vanity), "I can hardly tell you how much I admire the 
chapter on ‘ Pangenesis.’ It is a positive comfort to me to 
have any feasible explanation of a difficulty that has always 
been haunting me, and I shall never be able to give it up till 
a better one supplies its place, and that I think hardly 
possible, 8cc.” Now his foregoing [italicised] words express 
my sentiments exactly and fully: though perhaps I feel 
the relief extra strongly from having during many years 
vainly attempted to form some hypothesis. When you or 
Huxley say that a single cell of a plant, or the stump of an 
amputated limb, has the “potentiality” of reproducing the 
whole — or “diffuses an influence,” these words give me no 
positive idea ; — but, when it is said that the cells of a plant, 
or stump, include atoms derived from every other cell of the 
whole organism and capable of development, I gain a distinct 
idea. But this idea would not be worth a rush, if it applied 
to one case alone ; but it seems to me to apply to all the 
forms of reproduction — inheritance — metamorphosis — to the

abnormal transposition of organs — to the direct action of the 
male element on the mother plant, &c. Therefore I fully 
believe that each cell does actually throw off an atom or 
gemmule of its contents ; — but whether or not, this hypothesis 
serves as a useful connecting link for various grand classes 
of physiological facts, which at present stand absolutely 
isolated. 

I have touched on the doubtful point (alluded to by 
Huxley) how far atoms derived from the same cell may 
become developed into different structure accordingly as they 
are differently nourished ; I advanced as illustrations galls 
and polypoid excrescences. . . . 

It is a real pleasure to me to write to you on this subject, 
and I should be delighted if we can understand each other: 
but you must not let your good nature lead you on. Remem- 
ber we always fight tooth and nail. We go to London on 
Tuesday, first for a week to Queen Anne Street, and after- 
wards to Miss Wedgwood’s, in Regent’s Park, and stay the 
whole month, which, as my gardener truly says, is a “ terrible 
thing ” for my experiments. 



C. Darwin to W. Ogle.* 

Down, March 6 [1868J 

Dear Sir, — I thank you most sincerely for your letter, 
which is very interesting to me. I wish I had known of these 
views of Hippocrates before I had published, for they seem 
almost identical with mine — merely a change of terms — and 
an application of them to classes of facts necessarily unknown 
to the old philosopher. The whole case is a good illustration 
of how rarely anything is new. 

. . . Hippocrates has taken the wind out of my sails, but I 
care very little about being forestalled. I advance the views

merely as a provisional hypothesis, but with the secret expect- 
ation that sooner or later some such view will have to be 
admitted. 

... I do not expect the reviewers will be so learned as 
you : otherwise, no doubt, I shall be accused of wilfully 
stealing Pangenesis from Hippocrates, — for this is the spirit 
some reviewers delight to show. 



C. Darwin to Victor Cams. 

Down, March 21 [1868]. 

... I am very much obliged to you for sending me so 
frankly your opinion on Pangenesis, and I am sorry it is 
unfavourable, but I cannot quite understand your remark on 
pangenesis, selection, and the struggle for life not being more 
methodical. I am not at all surprised at your unfavourable 
verdict ; I know many, probably most, will come to the same 
conclusion. One English Review says it is much too com- 
plicated. . .. . Some of my friends are enthusiastic on the 
hypothesis. ... Sir C. Lyell says to every one, “You may 
not believe in ' Pangenesis,’ but if you once understand it, you 
will never get it out of your mind.” And with this criticism 
I am perfectly content. All cases of inheritance and reversion 
and development now appear to me under a new light. . . . 

[An extract from a letter to Fritz Muller, though of later 
date (June), may be given here : — 

"Your letter of April 22 has much interested me. I am 
delighted that you approve of my book, for I value your 
opinion more than that of almost any one. I have yet hopes 
that you will think well of Pangenesis. I feel sure that our 
minds are somewhat alike, and I find it a great relief to have 
some definite, though hypothetical view, when I reflect on the 
wonderful transformations of animals, — the re-growth of 
parts, — and especially the direct action of pollen on the

the characters of the parents are * photographed ’ on the 
child, only by means of material atoms derived from each 
cell in both parents, and developed in the child.”] 



C. Darwin to Asa Gray. 



Down, May 8 [.1868]. 

My dear Gray, — I have been a most ungrateful and 
ungracious man not to have written to you an immense time 
ago to thank you heartily for the Nation, and for all your 
most kind aid in regard to the American edition [of ‘ Animals 
and Plants ’J. But I have been of late ovenvhelmed with 
letters, which I was forced to answer, and so put off writing 
to you. This morning I received the American edition 
(which looks capital), with your nice preface, for which hearty 
thanks. I hope to heaven that the book will succeed well 
enough to prevent you repenting of your aid. This arrival 
has put the finishing stroke to my conscience, which will 
endure its wrongs no longer. 

. . . Your article in the Nation [Mar. 19] seems to me very 
good, and you give an excellent idea of Pangenesis — an infant 
cherished by few as yet, except his tender parent, but which 
will live a long life. There is parental presumption for you! 
You give a good slap at my concluding metaphor : * undoubt- 
edly I ought to have brought in and contrasted natural and 
artificial selection ; but it seemed so obvious to me that 
natural selection depended on contingencies even more 



* A short abstract of the precipice 
metaphor is given at p. 307, vol. i. 
Dr. Gray’s criticism on this point 
is as follows : “ But in Mr. Dar- 
win’s parallel, to meet the case of 
nature according to his own view 
of it, not only the fragments of rock 
(answering to variation) should fall, 



but the edifice (answering to natural 
selection) should rise, irrespective 
of will or choice ! ” But my father! 
parallel demands that natural selec- 
tion shall be the architect, not the 
edifice — the question of design only 
comes in with regard to the form 
of the building materials.

complex than those which must have determined the shape of 
each fragment at the base of my precipice. What I wanted 
to show was that, in reference to pre-ordainment, whatever 
holds good in the formation of a pouter pigeon holds good in 
the formation of a natural species of pigeon. I cannot see 
that this is false. If the right variations occurred, and no 
others, natural selection would be superfluous. A reviewer in 
an Edinburgh paper, who treats me with profound contempt, 
says on this subject that Professor Asa Gray could with the 
greatest ease smash me into little pieces.* 

Believe me, my dear Gray, 

Your ungrateful but sincere friend,

it is proper for me to do so, but I must and will thank you

what you say about my book. I got so tired of it, that for 
months together I thought myself a perfect fool for having 
given up so much time in collecting and observing little facts, 
but now I do not care if a score of common critics speak as 
contemptuously of the book as did the Athenaum. I feel 
justified in this, for I have so complete a reliance on your 
judgment that I feel certain that I should have bowed to your

scient creator.” The reviewer goes

copy of your Address ; if you have, I should much like to send

me add that I discussed bud-variation chiefly from a belief 
which is common to several persons, that all variability is 
related to sexual generation ; I wished to show clearly that 
this was an error.

extent, the reception which the new book received. Before

Dear Sir, — I thank you for your interesting essay on the 
influence of the Geological features of the country on the 
mind and habits of the Ancient Athenians,* and for your 
very obliging letter. I am delighted to hear that you intend 
to consider the relations of fossil animals in connection with 
their genealogy ; it will afford you a fine field for the exercise 
of your extensive knowledge and powers of reasoning. Your 
belief will I suppose, at present, lower you in the estimation 
of your countrymen ; but judging from the rapid spread in 
all parts of Europe, excepting France, of the belief in the 
common descent of allied species, I must think that this 
belief will before long become universal. How strange it is 
that the country which gave birth to Buffon, the elder 
Geoffrey, and especially to Lamarck, should now cling 
so pertinaciously to the belief that species are immutable 
creations.

present day I am continually abused or treated with contempt 
by writers of my own country ; but the younger naturalists 
are almost all on my side, and sooner or later the public 
must follow those who make the subject their special study. 
The abuse and contempt of ignorant writers hurts me very 
little. . . .

CHAPTER III. 



WORK ON ‘MAN. 

1864-1870. 

[In the autobiographical chapter (Vol. I. p. 93), my father gives 
the circumstances which led to his writing the ‘ Descent of 
Man.’ He states that his collection of facts, begun in 1837 or 
1838, was continued for many years without any definite idea of 
publishing on the subject The following letter to Mr. Wallace 
shows that in the period of ill-health and depression about 
1864 he despaired of ever being able to do so :] 



C. Darwin to A. R. Wallace. 

Down, [May ?] 28 [1864]. 

Dear WALLACE, — I am so much better that I have just 
finished a paper for Linnean Society ; • but I am not yet at all 
strong, I felt much disinclination to write, and therefore you 
must forgive me for not having sooner thanked you for your 
paper on ‘ Man,’t received on the 1 ith. But first let me say 
that I have hardly ever in my life been more struck by any 
paper than that on ‘ Variation,’ &c. See., in the Reader. \ I feel 
sure that such papers will do more for the spreading of

our views on the modification of species than any separate 
Treatises on the simple subject itself. It is really admirable ; 
but you ought not in the Man paper to speak of the theory 
as mine ; it is just as much yours as mine. One correspondent 
has already noticed to me your “ high-minded ” conduct on 
this head. But now for your Man paper, about which I 
should like to write more than I can. The great leading 
idea is quite new to me, viz. that during late ages, the mind 
will have been modified more than the body ; yet I had got 
as far as to see with you, that the struggle between the races 
of man depended entirely on intellectual and moral qualities. 
The latter part of the paper I can designate only as grand 
and most eloquently done. I have shown your paper to two 
or three persons who have been here, and they have been 
equally struck with it I am not sure that I go with you on 
all minor points : when reading Sir G. Grey’s account of the 
constant battles of Australian savages, I remember thinking 
that natural selection would come in, and likewise with the 
Esquimaux, with whom the art of fishing and managing canoes 
is said to be hereditary. I rather differ on the rank, under 
a classificatory point of view, which you assign to man ; I do 
not think any character simply in excess ought ever to be 
used for the higher divisions. Ants would not be separated 
from other hymenopterous insects, however high the instinct 
of the one, and however low the instincts of the other. With 
respect to the differences of race, a conjecture has occurred 
to me that much may be due to the correlation of complexion 
(and consequently hair) with constitution. Assume that a 
dusky individual best escaped miasma, and you will readily 
see what I mean. I persuaded the Director-General of the 
Medical Department of the Army to send printed forms to 
the surgeons of all regiments in tropical countries to ascertain 
this point, but I dare say I shall never get any returns. 
Secondly, I suspect that a sort of sexual selection has been

the most powerful means of changing the races of man. I 
can show that the different races have a widely different 
standard of beauty. Among savages the most powerful men 
will have the pick of the women, and they will generally leave 
the most descendants. I have collected a few notes on man, 
but I do not suppose that I shall ever use them. Do you 
intend to follow out your views, and if so, would you like at 
some future time to have my few references and notes ? I 
am sure I hardly know whether they are of any value, and 
they are at present in a state of chaos. 

There is much more that I should like to write, but I have 
not strength. 

Believe me, dear Wallace, yours very sincerely, 

Ch. Darwin. 

P.S. — Our aristocracy is handsomer (more hideous accord- 
ing to a Chinese or Negro) than the middle classes, from 
[having the] pick of the women ; but oh, what a scheme is 
primogeniture for destroying natural selection ! I fear my 
letter will be barely intelligible to you. 

[In February 1867, when the manuscript of ‘ Animals and 
Plants ’ had been sent to Messrs. Clowes to be printed, and 
before the proofs began to come in, he had an interval of spare 
time, and began a “ chapter on Man,” but he soon found it 
growing under his hands, and determined to publish it 
separately as a “ very small volume.” 

The work was interrupted by the necessity of correcting 
the proofs of ‘ Animals and Plants,’ and by some botanical 
work, but was resumed with unremitting industry on the first 
available day in the following year. He could not rest, and 
he recognized with regret the gradual change in his mind 
that rendered continuous work more and more necessary to 
him as he grew older. This is expressed in a letter to Sir 
J. D. Hooker, June 17, 1868, which repeats to some extent 
what is given in the Autobiography : —

[1867. 



“ I am glad you were at the ‘ Messiah,’ it is the one thing 
that I should like to hear again, but I dare say I should find 
my soul too dried up to appreciate it as in old days ; and 
then I should feel very flat, for it is a horrid bore to feel as I 
constantly do, that I am a withered leaf for every subject 
except Science. It sometimes makes me hate Science, though 
God knows I ought to be thankful for such a perennial 
interest, which makes me forget for some hours every day my 
accursed stomach.” 

The work on Man was interrupted by illness in the early 
summer of 1868, and he left home on July 16th for Fresh- 
water, in the Isle of Wight, where he remained with his 
family until August 21st. Here he made the acquaintance 
of Mrs. Cameron. She received the whole family with 
open-hearted kindness and hospitality, and my father always 
retained a warm feeling of friendship for her. She made 
an excellent photograph of him, which was published with 
the inscription written by him : “ I like this photograph 
very much better than any other which has been taken 
of me.” Further interruption occurred in the autumn, so 
that continuous work on the ‘ Descent of Man ’ did not 
begin until 1869. The following letters give some idea of 
the earlier work in 1867 : ] 



C. Darwin to A. R. Wallace. 

Down, February 22, [1867 ?] 

My DEAR WALLACE, — I am hard at work on sexual selec- 
tion, and am driven half mad by the number of collateral 
points which require investigation, such as the relative 
number of the two sexes, and especially on polygamy. 
Can you aid me with respect to birds which have strongly 
marked secondary sexual characters, such as birds of

paradise, humming-birds, the Rupicola, or any other such 
cases? Many gallinaceous birds certainly are polygamous. 
I suppose that birds may be known not to be polygamous 
if they are seen during the whole breeding season to asso- 
ciate in pairs, or if the male incubates or aids in feeding 
the young. Will you have the kindness to turn this in your 
mind ? But it is a shame to trouble you now that, as I am 
heartily glad to hear, you are at work on your Malayan 
travels. I am fearfully puzzled how far to extend your 
protective views with respect to the females in various 
classes. The more I work, the more important sexual 
selection apparently comes out 
Can butterflies be polygamous ? i.e. will one male impreg- 
nate more than one female ? Forgive me troubling you, and 
I dare say I shall have to ask forgiveness again. . . . 



C. Darwin to A. R. Wallace. 

Down, February 23 [1867]. 

Dear Wallace, — I much regretted that I was unable to 
call on you, but after Monday I was unable even to leave the 
house. On Monday evening I called on Bates, and put a 
difficulty before him, which he could not answer, and, as on 
some former similar occasion, his first suggestion was, “ You 
had better ask Wallace.” My difficulty is, why are cater- 
pillars sometimes so beautifully and artistically coloured? 
Seeing that many are coloured to escape danger, I can hardly 
attribute their bright colour in other cases to mere physical 
conditions. Bates says the most gaudy caterpillar he ever 
saw in Amazonia (of a sphinx) was conspicuous at the 
distance of yards, from its black and red colours, whilst 
feeding on large green leaves. If any one objected to male 
butterflies having been made beautiful by sexual selection, 
and asked why should they not have been made beautiful as

well as their caterpillars, what would you answer ? I could 
not answer, but should maintain my ground. Will you think 
over this, and some time, either by letter or when we meet, 
tell me what you think ? Also I want to know whether your 
female mimetic butterfly is more beautiful and brighter than 
the male. When next in London I must get you to show me 
your kingfishers. My health is a dreadful evil ; I failed in 
half my engagements during this last visit to London. 

Believe me, yours very sincerely, 

C. Darwin. 



C. Darwin to A. R. Wallace. 

Down, February 26 [1867], 

My DEAR Wallace, — Bates was quite right ; you are the 
man to apply to in a difficulty. I never heard anything 
more ingenious than your suggestion* and I hope you may 
be able to prove it true. That is a splendid fact about the 
white moths ; it warms one’s very blood to see a theory thus 
almost proved to be true.f With respect to the beauty of 
male butterflies, I must as yet think that it is due to sexual 
selection. There is some evidence that dragon-flies are 
attracted by bright colours ; but what leads me to the above 
belief, is so many male Orthoptera and Cicadas having 
musical instruments. This being the case, the analogy of 
birds makes me believe in sexual selection with respect to 
colour in insects. I wish I had strength and time to make 
some of the experiments suggested by you, but I thought 
butterflies would not pair in confinement I am sure I have 
heard of some such difficulty. Many years ago I had a

dragon-fly painted with gorgeous colours, but I never had an 
opportunity of fairly trying it. 

The reason of my being so much interested just at present 
about sexual selection is, that I have almost resolved to 
publish a little essay on the origin of Mankind, and I still 
strongly think (though I failed to convince you, and this, to 
me, is the heaviest blow possible) that sexual selection has 
been the main agent in forming the races of man. 

By the way, there is another subject which I shall intro- 
duce in my essay, namely, expression of countenance. Now, 
do you happen to know by any odd chance a very good- 
natured and acute observer in the Malay Archipelago, who 
you think would make a few easy observations for me on the 
expression of the Malays when excited by various emotions? 
For in this case I would send to such person a list of queries. 
I thank you for your most interesting letter, and remain, 
Yours very sincerely, 

Ch. Darwin. 



C. Darwin to A. R. Wallace. 

Down, March [1867]. 

My dear Wallace, — I thank you much for your two 
notes. The case of Julia Pastrana* is a splendid addition to 
my other cases of correlated teeth and hair, and I will add it 
in correcting the press of my present volume. Pray let me 
hear in the course of the summer if you get any evidence 
about the gaudy caterpillars. I should much like to give 
(or quote if published) this idea of yours, if in any way sup- 
ported, as suggested by you. It will, however, be a long 
time hence, for I can see that sexual selection is growing 
into quite a large subject, which I shall introduce into my 
essay on Man, supposing that I ever publish it. I had

intended giving a chapter on man, inasmuch as many call 
him (not quite truly) an eminently domesticated animal, but 
I found the subject too large for a chapter. Nor shall I be 
capable of treating the subject well, and my sole reason for 
taking it up is, that I am pretty well convinced that sexual 
selection has played an important part in the formation of 
races, and sexual selection has always been a subject which 
has interested me much. I have been very glad to see your 
impression from memory on the expression of Malays. I 
fully agree with you that the subject is in no way an im- 
portant one ; it is simply a “ hobby-horse ” with me, about 
twenty-seven years old ; and After thinking that I would write 
an essay on Man, it flashed on me that I could work in some 
“supplemental remarks on expression.” After the horrid, 
tedious, dull work of my present huge, and I fear unreadable, 
book [‘The Variation of Animals and Plants’], I thought 
I would amuse myself with my hobby-horse. The subject is, 
I think, more curious and more amenable to scientific treat- 
ment than you seem willing to allow. I want, anyhow, to 
upset Sir C. Bell’s view, given in his most interesting work, 
’ The Anatomy of Expression,’ that certain muscles have 
been given to man solely that he may reveal to other men 
his feelings. I want to try and show how expressions have 
arisen. That is a good suggestion about newspapers, but my 
experience tells me that private applications are generally 
most fruitful. I will, however, see if I can get the queries 
inserted in some Indian paper. I do not know the names or 
addresses of any other papers. 

. . . My two female amanuenses are busy with friends, and 
I fear this scrawl will give you much trouble to read. With 
many thanks, 

Yours very sincerely,

C. Darwin to F. Muller. 

Down, June 3 [1868]. 

. . . Many thanks for all the curious facts about the unequal 
number of the sexes in Crustacea, but the more I investigate 
this subject the deeper I sink in doubt and difficulty. Thanks 
also for the confirmation of the rivalry of Cicadae. I have 
often reflected with surprise on the diversity of the means for 
producing music with insects, and still more with birds. We 
thus get a high idea of the importance of song in the animal 
kingdom. Please to tell me where I can find any account 
of the auditory organs in the Orthoptera. Your facts are 
quite new to me. Scudder has described an insect in the 
Devonian strata, furnished with a stridulating apparatus. 
I believe he is to be trusted, and, if so, the apparatus is of 
astonishing antiquity. After reading Landois’s paper I have 
been working at the stridulating organ in the Lamellicom 
beetles, in expectation of finding it sexual ; but I have only 
found it as yet in two cases, and in these it was equally de- 
veloped in both sexes. I wish you would look at any of 
your common Lamellicoms, and take hold of both males 
and females, and observe whether they make the squeaking 
or grating noise equally. If they do not, you could, perhaps, 
send me a male and female in a light little box. How 
curious it is that there should be a special organ for an object 
apparently so unimportant as squeaking. Here is another 
point; have you any toucans? if so, ask any trustworthy 
hunter whether the beaks of the males, or of both sexes, 
are more brightly coloured during the breeding season than 
at other times of the year. . . . Heaven knows whether I 
shall ever live to make use of half the valuable facts which 
you have communicated to me! Your paper on Balanus

Down, July 6, 1868. 

My DEAR Sir, — I return you my sincere thanks for your 
long letter, which I consider a great compliment, and which 
is quite full of most interesting facts and views. Your 
references and remarks will be of great use should a new 
edition of my book * be demanded, but this is hardly prob- 
able, for the whole edition was sold within the first week, 
and another large edition immediately reprinted, which I 
should think would supply the demand for ever. You ask 
me when I shall publish on the ‘Variation of Species in 
a State of Nature.’ I have had the MS. for another volume 
almost ready during several years, but I was so much 
fatigued by my last book that I determined to amuse myself 
by publishing a short essay on the ‘ Descent of Man.’ I was 
partly led to do this by having been taunted that I concealed 
my views, but chiefly from the interest which I had long 
taken in the subject Now this essay has branched out into 
some collateral subjects, and I suppose will take me more 
than a year to complete. I shall then begin on ‘Species,’ 
but my health makes me a very slow workman. I hope that 
you will excuse these details, which I have given to show

that you will have plenty of time to publish your views first, 
which will be a great advantage to me. Of all the curious 
facts which you mention in your letter, I think that of the 
strong inheritance of the scalp-muscles has interested me 
most. I presume that you would not object to my giving 
this very curious case on your authority. As I believe all 
anatomists look at the scalp-muscles as a remnant of the 
Panniculus carnosus which is common to all the lower 
quadrupeds, I should look at the unusual development and 
inheritance of these muscles as probably a case of reversion. 
Your observation on so many remarkable men in noble 
families having been illegitimate is extremely curious ; and 
should I ever meet any one capable of writing an essay on 
this subject I will mention your remarks as a good sugges- 
tion. Dr. Hooker has several times remarked to me that 
morals and politics would be very interesting if discussed like 
any branch of natural history, and this is nearly to the same 
effect with your remarks. . . . 

C. Darwin to L. Agassiz. 

Down, August 19, 1868. 

Dear Sir, — I thank you cordially for your very kind 
letter. I certainly thought that you had formed so low an 
opinion of my scientific work that it might have appeared 
indelicate in me to have asked for information from you, but 
it never occurred to me that my letter would have been 
shown to you. I have never for a moment doubted your 
kindness and generosity, and I hope you will not think it 
presumption in me to say, that when we met, many years 
ago, at the British Association at Southampton, I felt for you 
the warmest admiration. 

Your information on the Amazonian fishes has interested 
me extremely, and tells me exactly what I wanted to know. 
I was aware, through notes given me by Dr. Giinther, that

many fishes differed sexually in colour and other characters, 
but I was particularly anxious to learn how far this was the 
case with those fishes in which the male, differently from 
what occurs with most birds, takes the largest share in the 
care of the ova and young. Your letter has not only 
interested me much, but has greatly gratified me in other 
respects, and I return you my sincere thanks for your kind- 
ness. Pray believe me, my dear Sir, 

Yours very faithfully,

appears to me most striking and excellent. How you must 
rejoice at all your bothering labour and anxiety having had 
so grand an end. I must say a word about myself ; never 
has such a eulogium been passed on me, and it makes me 
very proud. I cannot get over my amazement at what you 
say about my botanical work. By Jove, as far as my 
memory goes, you have strengthened instead of weakened 
some of the expressions. What is far more important than 
anything personal, is the conviction which I feel, that you 
will have immensely advanced the belief in the evolution of 
species. This will follow from the publicity of the occasion, 
your position, so responsible, as President, and your own high 
reputation. It will make a great step in public opinion, I feel 
sure, and I had not thought of this before. The A thenceum 
takes your snubbing * with the utmost mildness. I certainly 
do rejoice over the snubbing, and hope [the reviewer] will 
feel it a little. Whenever you have spare time to write again, 
tell me whether any astronomers f took your remarks in ill

he can underpin it and substitute 
a new foundation ; and after alt is 
finished, survey his edifice, not only

to him on December 1 : — 

“ In my opinion Dr. Joseph Dalton Hooker need take no

It is quite full of most interesting observations, stated with 
the greatest clearness. I have seldom read a paper with 
more interest, for it abounds with facts of direct use for my 
work. Many of them consist of little points which hardly 
any one besides yourself has observed, or perceived the im- 
portance of recording. I would instance the age at which the 
horns are developed (a point on which I have lately been in 
vain searching for information), the rudiment of horns in the 
female elk, and especially the different nature of the plants 
devoured by the deer and elk, and several other points. 
With cordial thanks for the pleasure and instruction which 
you have afforded me, and with high respect for your power 
of observation, I beg leave to remain, dear Sir,

[The following extract from a letter (Sept 24, 1868) to 
the Marquis de Saporta, the eminent palseo- botanist, refers 
to the growth of Evolutionary views in France : — • 

“As I have formerly read with great interest many of your 
papers on fossil plants, you may believe with what high 
satisfaction I hear that you are a believer in the gradual 
evolution of species. I had supposed that my book on the 
‘ Origin of Species ’ had made very little impression in France, 
and therefore it delights me to hear a different statement 
from you. All the great authorities of the Institute seem 
firmly resolved to believe in the immutability of species, and 
this has always astonished me. . . . Almost the one exception, 
as far as I know, is M. Gaudry, and I think he will be soon 
one of the chief leaders in Zoological Palaeontology in 
Europe ; and now I am delighted to hear that in the sister 
department of Botany you take nearly the same view.”]

My DEAR HAECKEL, — I must write to you again, for two 
reasons. Firstly, to thank you for your letter about your 
baby, which has quite charmed both me and my wife; I 
heartily congratulate you on its birth. I remember being 
surprised in my own case how soon the paternal instincts 
became developed, and in you they seem to be unusually 
strong, ... I hope the large blue eyes and the principles of 
inheritance will make your child as good a naturalist as you 
are ; but, judging from my own experience, you will be 
astonished to find how the whole mental disposition of your 
children changes with advancing years. A young child, and 
the same when nearly grown, sometimes differ almost as much 
as do a caterpillar and butterfly. 

The second point is to congratulate you on the projected 
translation of your great work* about which I heard from 
Huxley last Sunday. I am heartily glad of it, but how it has 
been brought about, I know not, for a friend who supported 
the proposed translation at Norwich, told me he thought 
there would be no chance of it Huxley tells me that you 
consent to omit and shorten some parts, and I am confident 
that this is very wise. As I know your object is to instruct 
the public, you will assuredly thus get many more readers 
in England. Indeed, I believe that almost every book 
would be improved by condensation. I have been reading a 
good deal of your last book,f and the style is beautifully 
clear and easy to me; but why it should differ so much 
in this respect from your great work I cannot imagine. I 
have not yet read the first part, but began with the 
chapter on Lyell and myself, which you will easily believe 

* ‘ Generelle Morphologie,’ 1866. Geschichte,’ i»68. It was traits-

pleased me very much. I think Lyell, who was apparently 
much pleased by your sending him a copy, is also much 
gratified by this chapter.* Your chapters on the affinities and 
genealogy of the animal kingdom strike me as admirable 
and full of original thought. Your boldness, however, 
sometimes makes me tremble, but as Huxley remarked, 
some one must be bold enough to make a beginning in 
drawing up tables of descent. Although you fully admit the 
imperfection of the geological record, yet Huxley agreed with 
me in thinking that you are sometimes rather rash in venturing 
to say at what periods the several groups first appeared. I have 
this advantage over you, that I remember how wonderfully 
different any statement on this subject made 20 years ago, 
would have been to what would now be the case, and I 
expect the next 20 years will make quite as great a difference. 
Reflect on the monocotyledonous plant just discovered in the 
primordial formation in Sweden. 

I repeat how glad I am at the prospect of the translation, 
for I fully believe that this work and all your works will 
have a great influence in the advancement of Science. 

Believe me, my dear Hackcl, your sincere friend, 

Charles Darwik. 



[It was in November of this year that he sat for the bust

with stupid letters, and am undergoing the purgatory of 
sitting for hours to Woolner, who, however, is wonderfully 
pleasant, and lightens as much as man can, the penance ; as 
far as I can judge, it will make a fine bust.”

Mr. Woolner, I should say that the point in which the bust 
fails somewhat as a portrait, is that it has a certain air, almost 
of pomposity, which seems to me foreign to my father’s 
expression.] 

1869. 

[At the beginning of the year he was at work in preparing 
the fifth edition of the ‘ Origin.’ This work was begun on 
the day after Christmas, 1868, and was continued for “forty- 
six days,’’ as he notes in his diary, i.e. until February 10th, 
1869. He then, February nth, returned to Sexual Selection, 
and continued at this subject (excepting for ten days given 
up to Orchids, and a week in , London), until June 10th, 
when he went with his family to North Wales, where he 
remained about seven weeks, returning to Down on July 31st 

Caerdeon, the house where he stayed, is built on the north 
shore of the beautiful Barmouth estuary, and is pleasantly 
placed in being close to wild hill country behind, as well as 
to the picturesque wooded “ hummocks," between the steeper 
hills and the river. My father was ill and somewhat depressed 
throughout this visit, and I think felt saddened at being 
imprisoned by his want of strength, and unable even to reach 
the hills over which he had once wandered for days together. 

He wrote from Caerdeon to Sir J. D. Hooker (June 22nd) 

“We have been here for ten days, how I wish it was 
possible for you to pay us a visit here ; we have a beautiful 
house with a terraced garden, and a really magnificent view 
of Cader, right opposite. Old Cader is a grand fellow, and 
shows himself off superbly with every changing light. We 
remain here till the end of July, when the H. Wedgwoods 
have the house. I have been as yet in a very poor way ; it 
seems as soon as the stimulus of mental work stops, my 
whole strength gives way. As yet I have hardly crawled half 
a mile from the house, and then have been fearfully fatigued. 
It is enough to make one wish oneself quiet in a comfortable

FLEEMING JENKIN.

With regard to the fifth edition of the * Origin,’ he wrote to 
Mr. Wallace, January 22, 1869) : — 

" I have been interrupted in my regular work in preparing 
a new edition of the ‘ Origin,’ which has cost me much labour, 
and which I hope I have considerably improved in two or 
three important points. I always thought individual differ- 
ences more important than single variations, but now I have 
come to the conclusion that they are of paramount import- 
ance, and in this I believe I agree with you. Fleeming 
Jenkin’s arguments have convinced me.” 

This somewhat obscure sentence was explained, February 2, 
in another letter to Mr. Wallace : — 

“ I must have expressed myself atrociously ; I meant to 
say exactly the reverse of what you have understood. 
F. Jenkin argued in the * North British Review ’ against single 
variations ever being perpetuated, and has convinced me, 
though not in quite so broad a manner as here put. I always 
thought individual differences more important ; but I was 
blind and thought that single variations might be preserved 
much oftener than I now see is possible or probable. I men- 
tioned this in my former note merely because I believed that 
you had come to a similar conclusion, and I like much to be 
in accord with you. I believe I was mainly deceived by 
single variations offering such simple illustrations, as when 

The late Mr. Fleeming Jenkin’s review, on the ‘Origin of 
Species,’ was published in the ‘ North British Review ’ for June 
1867. It is not a little remarkable that the criticisms, which 
my father, as I believe, felt to be the most valuable ever 
made on his views should have come, not from a professed 
naturalist but from a Professor of Engineering. 

It is impossible to give in a short compass an account of 
Fleeming Jenkin's argument. My father’s copy of the paper 
(ripped out of the volume as usual, and tied with a bit of 
string) is annotated in pencil in many places. I may quote

one passage opposite which my father has written “good 
sneers ” — but it should be remembered that he used the word 
“sneer" in rather a special sense, not as necessarily implying 
a feeling of bitterness in the critic, but rather in the sense 
of “ banter.” Speaking of the * true believer,’ Fleeming Jenkin 
says, p. 293 

“ He can invent trains of ancestors of whose existence 
there is no evidence ; he can marshal hosts of equally imagi- 
nary foes ; he can call up continents, floods, and peculiar 
atmospheres ; he can dry up oceans, split islands, and parcel 
out eternity at will ; surely with these advantages he must be 
a dull fellow if he cannot scheme some series of animals and 
circumstances explaining our assumed difficulty quite natur- 
ally. Feeling the difficulty of dealing with adversaries who 
command so huge a domain of fancy, we will abandon these 
arguments, and trust to those which at least cannot be assailed 
by mere efforts of imagination.” 

In the fifth edition of the ‘ Origin,’ my father altered a 
passage in the Historical Sketch (fourth edition, p. xviii). He 
thus practically gave up the difficult task of understanding 
whether or not Sir R. Owen claims to have discovered the 
principle of Natural Selection. Adding, “As far as the mere 
enunciation of the principle of Natural Selection is concerned, 
it is quite immaterial whether or not Professor Owen preceded 
me, for both of us . . . were long ago preceded by Dr. Wells 
and Mr. Matthew." 

A somewhat severe critique on the fifth edition, by Mr. John 
Robertson, appeared in the A thenceum, August 14, 1869. 
The writer comments with some little bitterness on the 
success of the ' Origin “ Attention is not acceptance. Many 
editions do not mean real success. The book has sold ; the 
guess has been talked over ; and the circulation and discus- 
sion sum up the significance of the editions.” Mr. Robertson 
makes the true, but misleading statement: “Mr. Darwin 
prefaces his fifth English edition with an Essay, which he

lS6p.] FIFTH EDITION OF THE ‘ORIGIN.’ I09 

calls ‘An Historical Sketch,’ &c.” As a matter of fact a 
Sketch appeared in the third edition in l86r. 

Mr. Robertson goes on to say that the Sketch ought to be 
called a collection of extracts anticipatory or corroborative of 
the hypothesis of Natural Selection. “For no account is 
given of any hostile opinions. The fact is very significant. 
This historical sketch thus resembles the histories of the reign 
of Louis XVIII., published after the Restoration, from which 
the Republic and the Empire, Robespierre and Buonaparte 
were omitted.” 

The following letter to Prof. Victor Cams gives an idea of 
the character of the new edition of the * Origin : ’] 

C. Darwin to Victor Carus. 

Down, May 4, 1869. 

... I have gone very carefully through the whole, trying to 
make some parts clearer, and adding a few discussions and 
facts of some importance. The new edition is only two pages 
at the end longer than the old ; though in one part nine pages 
in advance, for I have condensed several parts and omitted 
some passages. The translation I fear will cause you a great 
deal of trouble ; the alterations took me six weeks, besides 
correcting the press ; you ought to make a special agreement 
with M. Koch [the publisher]. Many of the corrections are 
only a few words, but they have been made from the evidence 
on various points appearing to have become a little stronger 

Thus I have been led to place somewhat more value on 
the definite and direct action of external conditions ; to think 
the lapse of time, as measured by years, not quite so great as 
most geologists have thought ; and to infer that single varia- 
tions are of even less importance, in comparison with indi- 
vidual differences, than I formerly thought I mention these 
points because I have been thus led to alter in many places 
a few words ; and unless you go through the whole new

edition, one part will not agree with another, which would be 
a great blemish. . . . 

[The desire that his views might spread in France was 
always strong with my father, and he was therefore justly 
annoyed to find that in 1869 the publisher of the first French 
edition had brought out a third edition without consulting 
the author. He was accordingly glad to enter into an 
arrangement for a French translation of the fifth edition ; this 
was undertaken by M. Reinwald, with whom he continued 
to have pleasant relations as the publisher of many of his 
books into French. 

He wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker : — 

“ I must enjoy myself and tell you about Mdlle. C. Royer, 
who translated the ' Origin ’ into French, and for whose 
second edition I took infinite trouble. She has now just 
brought out a third edition without informing me, so that all 
the corrections, &c., in the fourth and fifth English editions 
are lost. Besides her enormously long preface to the first 
edition, she has added a second preface abusing me like a 
pickpocket for Pangenesis, which of course has no relation to 
the ‘ Origin.’ So I wrote to Paris ; and Reinwald agrees to 
bring out at once a new translation from the fifth English 
edition, in competition with her third edition. . . . This fact 
shows that “ evolution of species ’’ must at last be spreading 

With reference to the spread of Evolution among the 
orthodox, the following letter is of some interest In March 
he received, from the author, a copy of a lecture by Rev. T. 
R. R. Stebbing, given before the Torquay Natural History 
Society, February 1, 1869, bearing the title “Darwinism." 
My father wrote to Mr. Stebbing :]

kindness in sending me your spirited and interesting lecture;

if a layman had delivered the same address, he would have 
done good service in spreading what, as I hope and believe, is 
to a large extent the truth ; but a clergyman in delivering such 
an address does, as it appears to me, much more good by his 
power to shake ignorant prejudices, and by setting, if I may 
be permitted to say so, an admirable example of liberality. 

With sincere respect, I beg leave to remain, 

Dear Sir, yours faithfully and obliged, 

Charles Darwin. 

[The references to the subject of expression in the following 
letter are explained by the fact, that my father’s original 
intention was to give his essay on this subject as a chapter 
in the ‘Descent of Man,’ which in its turn grew, as we have 
seen, out of a proposed chapter in ‘ Animals and Plants : ’] 



C. Darwin to F. Muller. 

Down, February 22, [1869?] 

. . . Although you have aided me to so great an extent in 
many ways, I am going to beg for any information on two other 
subjects. I am preparing a discussion on “ Sexual Selection,” 
and I want much to know how low down in the animal scale 
sexual selection of a particular kind extends. Do you know 
of any lowly organised animals, in which the sexes are 
separated, and in which the male differs from the female in 
arms of offence, like the horns and tusks of male mammals, or 
in gaudy plumage and ornaments, as with birds and butter- 
flies? I do not refer to secondary sexual characters, by which 
the male is able to discover the female, like the plumed 
antennae of moths, or by which the male is enabled to seize 
the female, like the curious pincers described by you in some 
of the lower Crustaceans. But what I want to know is, how 
low in the scale sexual differences occur which require some 
degree of self-consciousness in the males, as weapons by

which they fight for the female, or ornaments which attract 
the opposite sex. Any differences between males and females 
which follow different habits of life would have to be ex- 
cluded. I think you will easily see what I wish to learn. A 
priori , it would never have been anticipated that insects 
would have been attracted by the beautiful colouring of the 
opposite sex, or by the sounds emitted by the various musical 
instruments of the male Orthoptera. I know no one so likely 
to answer this question as yourself, and should be grateful for 
any information, however small. 

My second subject refers to expression of countenance, to 
which I have long attended, and on which I feel a keen 
interest ; but to which, unfortunately, I did not attend, when 
I had the opportunity of observing various races of man. It 
has occurred to me that you might, without much trouble, 
make a few observations for me, in the course of some 
months, on Negroes, or possibly on native South Americans, 
though I care most about Negroes ; accordingly I enclose 
some questions as a guide, and if you could answer me even 
one or two I should feel truly obliged. I am thinking of 
writing a little essay on the Origin of Mankind, as I have been 
taunted with concealing my opinions, and I should do this 
immediately after the completion of my present book. In 
this case I should add a chapter on the cause or meaning of 
expression. . . .

books, reviews, &c., which interested him.]

hasten to thank you for both, and for the very honourable

have the power to write so many brilliant essays as you have 
lately done. There is no one who writes like you. ... If 
I were in your shoes, I should tremble for my life. I agree 
with all you say, except that I must think that you draw 
too great a distinction between the evolutionists and the 
uniformitarians. 

I find that the few sentences which I have sent to press in 
the ‘ Origin ’ about the age of the world will do fairly well . . .

read. That you ever returned alive is wonderful after all 
your risks from illness and sea voyages, especially that most 
interesting one to Waigiou and back. Of all the impressions 
which I have received from your book, the strongest is that 
your perseverance in the cause of science was heroic. Your 
descriptions of catching the splendid butterflies have made 
me quite envious, and at the same time have made me feel 
almost young again, so vividly have they brought before my 
mind old days when I collected, though I never made such 
captures as yours. Certainly collecting is the best sport in 
the world. I shall be astonished if your book has not a great 
success ; and your splendid generalizations on Geographical 
Distribution, with which I am familiar from your papers, will 
be new to most of your readers. I think I enjoyed most the 
Timor case, as it is best demonstrated : but perhaps Celebes 
is really the most valuable. I should prefer looking at the 
whole Asiatic continent as having formerly been more African 
in its fauna, than admitting the former existence of a con- 
tinent across the Indian Ocean. . . . 

[The following letter refers to Mr. Wallace’s article in the 
April number of the ‘Quarterly Review,’* 1869, which to a 
large extent deals with the tenth edition of Sir Charles Lyell’s

a striking passage on Sir Charles Lyell's confession of evolu- 
tionary faith in the tenth edition of his ‘ Principles,’ which is 
worth quoting : “ The history of science hardly presents so 
striking an instance of youthfulness of mind in advanced life

which characterize every work which our author has produced, 
we shall be convinced that so great a change was not decided 
on without long and anxious deliberation, and that the views 
now adopted must indeed be supported by arguments of over- 
whelming force. If for no other reason than that Sir Charles 
Lyell in his tenth edition has adopted it, the theory of Mr. 
Darwin deserves an attentive and respectful consideration 
from every earnest seeker after truth.”] 

C. Dartuin to A. R. Wallace. 

Down, April 14, 1869. 

My dear Wallace, — I have been wonderfully interested 
by your article, and I should think Lyell will be much 
gratified by it I declare if I had been editor, and had the 
power of directing you, I should have selected for discussion 
the very points which you have chosen. I have often said to 
younger geologists (for I began in the year 1830) that they 
did not know what a revolution Lyell had effected ; neverthe- 
less, your extracts from Cuvier have quite astonished me. 
Though not able really to judge, I am inclined to put more 
confidence in Croll than you seem to do; but I have been 
much struck by many of your remarks on degradation. 
Thomson’s views of the recent age of the world have been for 
some time one of my sorest troubles, and so I have been glad 
to read what you say. Your exposition of Natural Selection 
seems to me inimitably good ; there never lived a better 
expounder than you. I was also much pleased at your 
discussing the difference between our views and Lamarck’s. 
One sometimes sees the odious expression, "Justice to myself 
compels me to say,” &c., but you are the only man I ever 
heard of who persistently does himself an injustice, and never 
demands justice. Indeed, you ought in the review to have 
alluded to your paper in the ‘Linnean Journal,’ and I feel 
sure all our friends will agree in this. But you cannot

“ Burke ” yourself, however much you may try, as may be 
seen in half the articles which appear. I was asked but the 
other day by a German professor for your paper, which I 
sent him. Altogether I look at your article as appearing in 
the ‘ Quarterly ’ as an immense triumph for our cause. I pre- 
sume that your remarks on Man are those to which you 
alluded in your note. If you had not told me I should have 
thought that they had been added by some one else. As you 
expected, I differ grievously from you, and I am very sorry 
for it. I can see no necessity for calling in an additional and 
proximate cause in regard to man.* But the subject is too 
long for a letter. I have been particularly glad to read your 
discussion because I am now writing and thinking much 
about man. 

I hope that your Malay book sells well ; I was extremely 
pleased with the article in the ‘Quarterly Journal of Science,' 
inasmuch as it is thoroughly appreciative of your work : alas! 
you will probably agree with what the writer says about the 
uses of the bamboo. 

I hear that there is also a good article in the Saturday 
Review, but have heard nothing more about it. Believe me, 
my dear Wallace, 

Yours ever sincerely,

heaven, I have finished correcting the new edition of the

Wallace’s article struck me as admirable ; how well he 
brought out the revolution which you effected some 30 years 
ago. I thought I had fully appreciated the revolution, but I 
was astounded at the extracts from Cuvier. What a good 
sketch of natural selection 1 but I was dreadfully disappointed 
about Man, it seems to me incredibly strange . . . ; and had 
I not known to the contrary, would have sworn it had been 
inserted by some other hand. But I believe that you will not 
agree quite in all this.

interested by it to the last page. It is impossible that any 
account of my views could be fairer, or, as far as space per- 
mitted, fuller, than that which you have given. The way in 
which you repeatedly mention my name is most gratifying to 
me. When I had finished the second part, I thought that 
you had stated the case so favourably that you would make

more converts on my side than on your own side, On read- 
ing the subsequent parts I had to change my sanguine view. 
In these latter parts many of your strictures are severe 
enough, but all are given with perfect courtesy and fairness. 
I can truly say I would rather be criticised by you in this 
manner than praised by many others. I agree with some of 
your criticisms, but differ entirely from the remainder ; but I 
will not trouble you with any remarks. I may, however, say, 
that you must have been deceived by the French translation, as 
you infer that I belie ve that the Parus and the N uthatch (or Sitta) 
are related by direct filiation. I wished only to show, by an 
imaginary illustration, how either instincts or structures might 
first change. If you had seen Catiis Magellauicus alive you 
would have perceived how foxlike its appearance is, or if you 
had heard its voice, I think that you would never have 
hazarded the idea that it was a domestic dog run wild ; but 
this does not much concern me. It is curious how nationality 
influences opinion ; a week hardly passes without my hearing 
of some naturalist in Germany who supports my views, and 
often puts an exaggerated value on my works ; whilst in 
France I have not heard of a single zoologist, except M. 
Gaudry (and he only partially), who supports my views. But 
I must have a good many readers as my books are translated, 
and I must hope, notwithstanding your strictures, that I may 
influence some embryo naturalists in France. 

You frequently speak of my good faith, and no compliment 
can be more delightful to me, but I may return you the 
compliment with interest, for every word which you write 
bears the stamp of your cordial love for the truth. Believe 
me, dear Sir, with sincere respect, 

Yours very faithfully, 

Charles Darwin.

head. But I write now ( requiring no answer) to groan a little 
over what you have said about rudimentary organs, f Many 
heretics will take advantage of what you have said. I cannot 
but think that the explanation given at p. 541 of the last 
edition of the ‘ Origin,’ of the long retention of rudimentary 
organs and of their greater relative size during early life, is 
satisfactory. Their final and complete abortion seems to me 
a much greater difficulty. Do look in my * Variations under 
Domestication,’ vol. iL p. 397, at what Pangenesis suggests on 
this head, though I did not dare to put it in the ‘ Origin.’ 
The passage bears also a little on the struggle between the 
molecules or gemmules.J There is likewise a word or two 
indirectly bearing on this subject at pp. 394-395- It won’t 
take you five minutes, so do look at these passages. I am 
very glad that you have been bold enough to give your idea 
about Natural Selection amongst the molecules, though I 
cannot quite follow you.

t In discussing Teleology and 
Haeckel’s “ Dysteleology,” Prof. 
Huxley says: — “Such cases as 
the existence of lateral rudiments 
of toes, in the foot of a horse, place 
us in a dilemma. For either these 
rudiments are of no use to the 
animals, in which case . . . they 
surely ought to have disappeared ; 
or they are of some use to the 
animal, in which case they are of 
no use as arguments against Tele- 



ology.” — ‘Critiques and Addresses,’

t “ It is a probable hypothesis, 
that what the world is to organisms 
in general, each organism is to the 
molecules of which it is composed. 
Multitudes of these having diverse 
tendencies, are competing with one 
another for opportunity to exist 
and multiply j and the organism, 
as a whole, is as much the product 
of the molecules which are victori- 
ous as the Fauna, or Flora, of a 
country is the product of the vict- 
orious organic beings in it.”—

Down, March 15 [1870]. 

My DEAR Sir, — I do not know whether you will consider 
me a very troublesome man, but I have just finished your 
book,* and cannot resist telling you how the whole has much 
interested me. No doubt, as you say, there must be much 
speculation on such a subject, and certain results cannot be 
reached ; but all your views are highly suggestive, and to my 
mind that is high praise. I have been all the more interested, 
as I am now writing on closely allied though not quite identi- 
cal points. I was pleased to see you refer to my much 
despised child, ‘ Pangenesis,’ who I think will some day, under 
some better nurse, turn out a fine stripling. It has also 
pleased me to see how thoroughly you appreciate (and I do 
not think that this is general with the men of science) 
H. Spencer ; I suspect that hereafter he will be looked at as 
by far the greatest living philosopher in England ; perhaps 
equal to any that have lived. But I have no business to 
trouble you with my notions. With sincere thanks for the 
interest which your work has given me, 

I remain, yours very faithfully, 

Ch. Darwin.

My dear Wallace, — I have just received your book, 
and read the preface. There never has been passed on me, or 
indeed on any one, a higher eulogium than yours. I wish 
that I fully deserved it Your modesty and candour are very 
far from new to me. I hope it is a satisfaction to you to 
reflect — and very few things in my life have been more satis- 
factory to me — that we have never felt any jealousy towards 
each other, though in one sense rivals. I believe that I can 
say this of myself with truth, and I am absolutely sure that 
it is true of you. 

You have been a good Christian to give a list of your 
additions, for I want much to read them, and I should hardly 
have had time just at present to have gone through all your 
articles. Of course I shall immediately read those that are 
new or greatly altered, and I will endeavour to be as honest 
as can reasonably be expected. Your book looks remarkably 
well got up. 

Believe me, my dear Wallace, to remain, 

Yours very cordially,

smooth. How I wish to see the two other, and even more 
important, ones of the feathers, and the four [of] reptiles, &c.

real pleasure to me.

then I think I shall cause no more trouble. I will get the

as she is the incubator. As I crawl on with the successive

C. Darwin to A. R. Wallace. 

Down, September 23 [undated]. 

My DEAR WALLACE, — I am very much obliged for all your 
trouble in writing me your long letter, which I will keep by 
me and ponder over. To answer it would require at least 
200 folio pages 1 If you could see how often I have re-written 
some pages you would know how anxious I am to arrive as 
near as I can to the truth. I lay great stress on what I know 
takes place under domestication; I think we start with 
different fundamental notions on inheritance. I find it is 
most difficult, but not I think impossible, to see how, for 
instance, a few red feathers appearing on the head of a 
male bird, and which are at first tratismitted to both sexes, 
could come to be transmitted to males alone. It is not 
enough that females should be produced from the males 
with red feathers, which should be destitute of red feathers ; 
but these females must have a latent tendency to produce 
such feathers, otherwise they would cause deterioration 
in the red head-feathers of their male offspring. Such 



© The Complete Work of Charles Darwin Online 



124 WORK ON ‘MAN.’ [187a 

latent tendency would be shown by their producing the 
red feathers when old, or diseased in their ovaria. But 
I have no difficulty in making the whole head red if the 
few red feathers in the male from the first tended to be 
sexually transmitted. I am quite willing to admit that the 
female may have been modified, either at the same time 
or subsequently, for protection by the accumulation of varia- 
tions limited in their transmission to the female sex. I owe to 
your writings the consideration of this latter point But I 
cannot yet persuade myself that females alone have often 
been modified for protection. Should you grudge the trouble 
briefly to tell me, whether you believe that the plainer head 
and less bright colours of ? chaffinch* the less red on the head 
and less clean colours of ? goldfinch, the much less red on 
the breast of ? bullfinch, the paler crest of golden-crested 
wren, &c., have been acquired by them for protection. I 
cannot think so, any more than I can that the considerable 
differences between $ and $ house sparrow, or much greater 
brightness of $ Parus cceruleus (both of which build under 
cover) than of ? Parus , are related to protection. I even 
misdoubt much whether the less blackness of 9 blackbird is 
for protection. 

Again, can you give me reasons for believing that the 
moderate differences between the female pheasant, the female 
Gallus bankiva, the female of black grouse, the pea-hen, the 
female partridge, have all special references to protection under 
slightly different conditions ? I, of course, admit that they are 
all protected by dull colours, derived, as I think, from some 
dull-ground progenitor ; and I account partly for their 
difference by partial transference of colour from the male, 
and by other means too long to specify ; but I earnestly wish 
to see reason to believe that each is specially adapted for 
concealment to its environment. 

I grieve to differ from you, and it actually terrifies me and

makes me constantly distrust myself. I fear we shall never 
quite understand each other. I value the cases of bright- 
coloured, incubating male fishes, and brilliant female butter- 
flies, solely as showing that one sex may be made brilliant 
without any necessary transference of beauty to the other 
sex ; for in these cases I cannot suppose that beauty in the 
other sex was checked by selection. 

I fear this letter will trouble you to read it A very short 
answer about your belief in regard to the ? finches and 
gallinaceae would suffice. 

Believe me, my dear Wallace, 

Yours very sincerely,

Down, May 25 [1870} 

.... Last Friday we all went to the Bull Hotel at 
Cambridge to see the boys, and for a little rest and enjoyment. 
The backs of the Colleges are simply paradisaical. On 
Monday I saw Sedgwick, who was most cordial and kind ; in 
the morning I thought his brain was enfeebled ; in the evening 
he was brilliant and quite himself. His affection and kind- 
ness charmed us all. My visit to him was in one way un- 
fortunate ; for after a long sit he proposed to take me to the 
museum, and I could not refuse, and in consequence he utterly 
prostrated me ; so that we left Cambridge next morning, and 
I have not recovered the exhaustion yet. Is it not humiliating 
to be thus killed by a man of eighty-six, who evidently never 
dreamed that he was killing me ? As he said to me, “ Oh, I 
consider you as a mere baby to me ! ” I saw Newton several 
times, and several nice friends of F.’s. But Cambridge with- 
out dear Henslow was not itself ; I tried to get to the two 
old houses, but it was too far for me. . . .

Down, June 30 [1870]. 

My dear Sulivan, — It was very good of you to write to 
me so long a letter, telling me much about yourself and your 
children, which I was extremely glad to hear. Think what a 
benighted wretch I am, seeing no one and reading but little 
in the newspapers, for I did not know (until seeing the paper 
of your Natural History Society) that you were a K.C.B. 
Most heartily glad I am that the Government have at last 
appreciated your most just claim for this high distinction. On 
the other hand, I am sorry to hear so poor an account of your 
health ; but you were surely very rash to do all that you did 
and then pass through so exciting a scene as a ball at the 
Palace. It was enough to have tired a man in robust health. 
Complete rest will, however, I hope, quite set you up again. 
As for myself, I have been rather better of late, and if nothing 
disturbs me I can do some hours’ work every day. I shall 
this autumn publish another book partly on man, which I 
dare say many will decry as very wicked. I could have 
travelled to Oxford, but could no more have withstood the 
excitement of a commemoration f than I could a ball at 
Buckingham Palace. Many thanks for your kind remarks 
about my boys. Thank God, all give me complete satisfac- 
tion ; my fourth stands second at Woolwich, and will be an

kindly remembered to Lady Sulivan, in which I very sincerely

[My father’s connection with the South American Mission, 
which is referred to in the above letter, has given rise to some 
public comment, and has been to some extent misunder- 
stood. The Archbishop of Canterbury, speaking at the 
annual meeting of the South American Missionary Society, 
April 21st, 1885,* said that the Society “drew the attention 
of Charles Darwin, and made him, in his pursuit of the 
wonders of the kingdom of nature, realise that there was 
another kingdom just as wonderful and more lasting.” 
Some discussion on the subject appeared in the Daily News 
of April 23rd, 24th, 29th, 1885, and finally Admiral Sir 
james Sulivan, on April 24th, wrote to the same journal, 
giving a clear account of my father’s connection with the 

“Your article in the Daily News of yesterday induces me 
to give you a correct statement of the connection between the 
South American Missionary Society and Mr. Charles Darwin, 
my old friend and shipmate for five years. I have been 
closely connected with the Society from the time of Captain 
Allen Gardiner’s death, and Mr. Darwin had often expressed 
to me his conviction that it was utterly useless to send 
Missionaries to such a set of savages as the Fuegians, prob-

replied that I did not believe any human beings existed too 
low to comprehend the simple message of the Gospel of Christ. 
After many years, I think about 1869,* but I cannot find the 
letter, he wrote to me that the recent accounts of the Mission 
proved to him that he had been wrong and I right in our 
estimates of the native character, and the possibility of doing 
them good through Missionaries ; and he requested me to 
forward to the Society an enclosed cheque for £5, as a 
testimony of the interest he took in their good work. On 
June 6th, 1874, he wrote : ‘ I am very glad to hear so good 
an account of the Fuegians, and it is wonderful’ On June 
10th, 1879 : ‘The progress of the Fuegians is wonderful, and 
had it not occurred would have been to me quite incredible.’ 
On January 3rd, 1880 : ' Your extracts [from a journal] ‘ about 
the Fuegians are extremely curious, and have interested me 
much. I have often said that the progress of Japan was the 
greatest wonder in the world, but I declare that the progress 
of Fuegia is almost equally wonderful.’ On March 20th, 
1881 : ‘The account of the Fuegians interested not only me, 
but all my family. It is truly wonderful what you have heard 
from Mr. Bridges about their honesty and their language. I 
certainly should have predicted that not all the Missionaries 
in the world could have done what has been done.’ On 
December 1st, 1881, sending me his annual subscription to 
the Orphanage at the Mission Station, he wrote: ‘Judging 
from the Missionary Journal, the Mission in Tierra del 
Fuego seems going on quite wonderfully well.’ ”]

COUSIN MARRIAGES.

C. Darwin to John Lubbock. 

Down, July 17, 1870. 

My dear Lubbock— As I hear that the Census will be 
brought before the House to-morrow, I write to say how 
much I hope that you will express your opinion on the 
desirability of queries in relation to consanguineous marriages 
being inserted. As you are aware, I have made experiments 
on the subject during several years ; and it is my clear con- 
viction that there is now ample evidence of the existence of a 
great physiological law, rendering an enquiry with reference to 
mankind of much importance. In England and many parts of 
Europe the marriages of cousins are objected to from their 
supposed injurious consequences ; but this belief rests on no 
direct evidence. It is therefore manifestly desirable that the 
belief should either be proved false, or should be confirmed, so 
that in this latter case the marriages of cousins might be 
discouraged. If the proper queries are inserted, the returns 
would show whether married cousins have in their households 
on the night of the census as many children as have parents 
who are not related ; and should the number prove fewer, we 
might safely infer either lessened fertility in the parents, or 
which is more probable, lessened vitality in the offspring. 

It is, moreover, much to be wished that the truth of the 
often repeated assertion that consanguineous marriages lead 
to deafness, and dumbness, blindness, &c., should be ascer- 
tained ; and all such assertions could be easily tested by the 
returns from a single census. 

Believe me, 

Yours very sincerely, 
Charles Darwin. 

[When the Census Act was passing through the House of 
Commons, Sir John Lubbock and Dr. Playfair attempted to 
carry out this suggestion. The question came to a division, 
which was lost, but not by many votes.

The subject of cousin marriages was afterwards investigated 
by my brother.* The results of this laborious piece of work 
were negative ; the author sums up in the sentence : — 

“ My paper is far from giving anything like a satisfactory 
solution of the question as to the effects of consanguine- 
ous marriages, but it does, I think, show that the assertion 
that this question has already been set at rest, cannot be 
substantiated.”]

PUBLICATION OF THE ‘DESCENT OF MAN.’ 

THE ‘EXPRESSION OF THE EMOTIONS.’ 

I87I-1873. 

[The last revise of the ‘ Descent of Man ’ was corrected on 
January 15th, 1871, so that the book occupied him for about 
three years. He wrote to Sir J. Hooker: "I finished the 
last proofs of my book a few days ago ; the work half-killed 
me, and I have not the most remote idea whether the book 
is worth publishing.” 

He also wrote to Dr. Gray : — 

“ I have finished my book on the 1 Descent of Man,’ &c., 
and its publication is delayed only by the Index : when pub- 
lished, I will send you a copy, but I do not know that you 
will care about it. Parts, as on the moral sense, will, I dare 
say. aggravate you, and if I hear from you, I shall probably 
receive a few stabs from your polished stiletto of a pen.” 

The book was published on February 24, 187.1. 2500 
copies were printed at first, and 5000 more before the end of 
the year. My father notes that he received for this edition 
£ 1470. The letters given in the present chapter deal with 
its reception, and also with the progress of the work on 
Expression. The letters are given, approximately, in chrono- 
logical order, an arrangement which necessarily separates

letters of kindred subject-matter, but gives perhaps a truer 
picture of the mingled interests and labours of my father’s life. 

Nothing can give a better idea (in a small compass) of the 
growth of Evolutionism, and its position at this time, than a 
quotation from Mr. Huxley*: — 

“ The gradual lapse of time has now separated us by more 
than a decade from the date of the publication of the ‘ Origin 
of Species ; ’ and whatever may be thought or said about 
Mr. Darwin’s doctrines, or the manner in which he has pro- 
pounded them, this much is certain, that in a dozen years the 
* Origin of Species ’ has worked as complete a revolution in 
Biological Science as the ‘ Principia ’ did in Astronomy ; ” and 
it has done so, “because, in the words of Helmholtz, it 
contains ‘ an essentially new creative thought.’ And, as time 
has slipped by, a happy change has come over Mr. Darwin's 
critics. The mixture of ignorance and insolence which at 
first characterised a large proportion of the attacks with which 
he was assailed, is no longer the sad distinction of anti- 
Darwinian criticism.” 

A passage in the Introduction to the ‘ Descent of Man ' 
shows that the author recognised clearly this improvement in 
the position of Evolutionism. “When a naturalist like Carl 
Vogt ventures to say in his address, as President of the 
National Institution of Geneva (1869), ‘ personne, en Europe 
au moins, n’ose plus soutenir la creation indepcndantc et 
de toutes pieces, des espfeces,’ it is manifest that at least 
a large number of naturalists must admit that species are 
the modified descendants of other species; and this especi- 
ally holds good with the younger and rising naturalists. 
... Of the older and honoured chiefs in natural science, 
many, unfortunately, are still opposed to Evolution in every

he describes a visit to my father “ early in 1871,”* shortly 
after the publication of the ‘ Descent of Man.’ Mr. Hague 
represents my father as “ much impressed by the general 
assent with which his views had been received,” and as 
remarking that “ everybody is talking about it without being 
shocked.” 

Later in the year the reception of the book is described in 
different language in the ' Edinburgh Review ’ : f “ On every 
side it is raising a storm of mingled wrath, wonder and 
admiration.” 

With regard to the subsequent reception of the ‘ Descent of 
Man,’ my father wrote to Dr. Dohm, February 3, 1872 : — 

"I did not know until reading your article,^ that my 
‘ Descent of Man ’ had excited so much furore in Germany. 
It has had an immense circulation in this country and in 
America, but has met the approval of hardly any naturalists 
as far as I know. Therefore I suppose it was a mistake on 
my part to publish it ; but, anyhow, it will pave the way for 
some better work.” 

The book on the ‘ Expression of the Emotions ’ was begun 
on January 17th, 1871, the last proof of the * Descent of Man ’ 
having been finished on January 15th. The rough copy was 
finished by April 27th, and shortly after this (in June) the 
work was interrupted by the preparation of a sixth edition of 
the * Origin.’ In November and December the proofs of the 
‘Expression’ book were taken in hand, and occupied him 
until the following year, when the book was published. 

Some references to the work on Expression have occurred 
in letters already given, showing that the foundation of the 
book was, to some extent, laid down for some years before he

began to write it. Thus he wrote to Dr. Asa Gray, April 15, 
1867 : — 

“ I have been lately getting up and looking over my old 
notes on Expression, and fear that I shall not make so much 
of my hobby-horse as I thought I could ; nevertheless, it 
seems to me a curious subject which has been strangely 
neglected.” 

It should, however, be remembered that the subject had 
been before his mind, more or less, from 1837 or 1838, as 
I judge from entries in his early note-books. It was in 
December 1839, that he began to make observations on 
children. 

The work required much correspondence, not only with 
missionaries and others living among savages, to whom he 
sent his printed queries, but among physiologists and phy- 
sicians. He obtained much information from Professor 
Donders, Sir W. Bowman, Sir James Paget, Dr. W. Ogle, 
Dr. Crichton Browne, as well as from other observers. 

The first letter refers to the ‘ Descent of Man/] 



C. Darwin to A. R. Wallace. 

Down, January 30 [1871J. 

My dear WALLACE, — Your note * has given me very great 
pleasure, chiefly because I was so anxious not to treat you 



* In the note referred to, dated 
January 27, Mr. Wallace wrote : — 
“ Many thanks for your first volume 
which I have just finished reading 
through with the greatest pleasure 
and interest ; and I have also to 
thank you for the great tenderness 
with which you have treated me 
and my heresies.” 

The heresy is the limitation of 
natural selection as applied to man. 
My father wrote (‘ Descent of 
Man,’ i. p. 137) : — “ I cannot there- 
fore understand how it is that Mr. 



Wallace maintains that ‘natural 
selection could only have endowed 
the savage with a brain a little 
superior to that of an ape.’” In 
the above quoted letter Mr. Wallace 
wrote : — “ Your chapters on ‘ Man ' 
are of intense interest, but as touch- 
ing my special heresy not as yet 
altogether convincing, though of 
course I fully agree with every word 
and every argument which goes to 
prove the evolution or development 
of man out of a lower form."

with the least disrespect, and it is so difficult to speak fairly 
when differing from any one. If I had offended you, it 
would have grieved me more than you will readily believe. 
Secondly, I am greatly pleased to hear that Vol. I. interests 
you ; I have got so sick of the whole subject that I felt in 
utter doubt about the value of any part. I intended, when 
speaking of females not having been specially modified for 
protection, to include the prevention of characters acquired 
by the $ being transmitted to 9 ; but I now see it would have 
been better to have said “ specially acted on,” or some such term. 
Possibly my intention may be clearer in Vol. II. Let me say 
that my conclusions are chiefly founded on the consideration 
of all animals taken in a body, bearing in mind how common 
the rules of sexual differences appear to be in all classes. 
The first copy of the chapter on Lepidoptera agreed pretty 
closely with you. I then worked on, came back to Lepi- 
doptera, and thought myself compelled to alter it — finished 
Sexual Selection and for the last time went over Lepidoptera, 
and again I felt forced to alter it. I hope to God there will 
be nothing disagreeable to you in Vol. II., and that I have 
spoken fairly of your views ; I am fearful on this head, because 
I have just read (but not with sufficient care) Mivart’s book,* 
and I feel absolutely certain that he meant to be fair (but he 
was stimulated by theological fervour) ; yet I do not think he 
has been quite fair. . . . The part which, I think, will have 
most influence is where he^gives the whole series of cases like 
that of the whalebone, in which we cannot explain the grada- 
tional steps ; but such cases have no weight on my mind — if a 
few fish were extinct, who on earth would have ventured even 
to conjecture that lungs had originated in a swim-bladder? 
In such a case as the Thylacine, I think he was bound to say 
that the resemblance of the jaw to that of the dog is super- 
ficial ; the number and correspondence and development of 
teeth being widely different. I think again when speaking

of the necessity of altering a number of characters together, 
he ought to have thought of man having power by selection 
to modify simultaneously or almost simultaneously many 
points, as in making a greyhound or racehorse — as enlarged 
upon in my ‘ Domestic Animals.’ Mivart is savage or con- 
temptuous about my “ moral sense,” and so probably will yon 
be. I am extremely pleased that he agrees with my position, 
as far as animal nature is concerned, of man in the series ; or 
if anything, thinks I have erred in making him too distinct. 

Forgive me for scribbling at such length. You have put me 
quite in good spirits ; I did so dread having been uninten- 
tionally unfair towards your views. I hope earnestly the 
second volume will escape as well. I care now very little what 
others say. As for our not quite agreeing, really in such 
complex subjects, it is almost impossible for two men who 
arrive independently at their conclusions to agree fully, it 
would be unnatural for them to do so. 

Yours ever, very sincerely, 

Ch. Darwin.

write to my father about the ‘ Descent of Man.’ I quote from 
his reply : —

that you approve of my book, as far as you have read it. I

find that I have expressed my high admiration of your labours 
with sufficient clearness ; I am sure that I have not expressed 
it too strongly.”] 



C. Darwin to A. R. Wallace. 

Down, March 16, 1871. 

My DEAR Wallace, — I have just read your grand review.* 
It is in every way as kindly expressed towards myself as it is 
excellent in matter. The Lyells have been here, and Sir C. 
remarked that no one wrote such good scientific reviews as 
you, and as Miss Buckley added, you delight in picking out 
all that is good, though very far from blind to the bad. In 
all this I most entirely agree. I shall always consider your 
review as a great honour ; and however much my book may 
hereafter be abused, as no doubt it will be, your review will 
console me, notwithstanding that we differ so greatly. I will 
keep your objections to my views in my mind, but I fear that 
the latter are almost stereotyped in my mind. I thought for 
long weeks about the inheritance and selection difficulty, and 
covered quires of paper with notes in trying to get out of it, 
but could not, though clearly seeing that it would be a great 
relief if I could. I will confine myself to two or three 
remarks. I have been much impressed with what you urge 
against colour, t in the case of insects, having been acquired 



tiirlichc Schdpfungs - gcschichte,’ 
in which he fully discusses the 
genealogy of man. If this work 
had appeared before my essay 
had been written, I should pro- 
bably never have completed it. 
Almost all the conclusions at 
which I have arrived, I find con- 
firmed by this naturalist, whose 
knowledge on many points is much 
fuller than mine.” 

* Academy , March 15, 1871. 



f Mr. Wallace says that the pair- 
ing of butterflies is probably deter- 
mined by the fact that one male is 
stronger-winged, or more pertina- 
cious than the rest, rather than by 
the choice of the females. He 
quotes the case of caterpillars which 
arc brightly coloured and yet sex- 
less. Mr. Wallace also makes the 
good criticism, that the • Descent of 
Man’ consists of two books mixed 
together.

through sexual selection. I always saw that the evidence 
was very weak ; but I still think, if it be admitted that the 
musical instruments of insects have been gained through 
sexual selection, that there is not the least improbability in 
colour having been thus gained. Your argument with respect 
to the denudation of mankind and also to insects, that taste 
on the part of one sex would have to remain nearly the same 
during many generations, in order that sexual selection should 
produce any effect, I agree to; and I think this argument 
would be sound if used by one who denied that, for instance, 
the plumes of birds of Paradise had been so gained. I believe 
you admit this, and if so I do not see how your argument 
applies in other cases. I have recognised for some short time 
that I have made a great omission in not having discussed, as 
far as I could, the acquisition of taste, its inherited nature, 
and its permanence within pretty close limits for long periods. 



[With regard to the success of the ‘ Descent of Man,’ I 
quote from a letter to Professor Ray Lankester (March 22, 
1871)2 — 

“ I think you will be glad to hear, as a proof of the in- 
creasing liberality of England, that my book has sold wonder- 
fully .... and as yet no abuse (though some, no doubt, will 
come, strong enough), and only contempt even in the poor 
old Athen<Bum." 

As to reviews that struck him he wrote to Mr. Wallace 
(March 24, 1871) : — 

“ There is a very striking second article on my book in the 
Pall Mall. The articles in the Spectator * have also interested 
me much." 



* Spectator, March n and 18, 
1871. With regard to the evolution 
of conscience the reviewer thinks 
that my father comes much nearer 
to the “ kernel of the psychological 
problem ” than many of his prede- 
cessors. The second article con- 



bearing of the book on the question 
of design, and concludes by finding 
in it a vindication of Theism more 
wonderful than that in Paley’s 
‘ Natural Theology.’

REVIEWS. 



139 



1871 .] 

On March 20 he wrote to Mr. Murray : — 

“ Many thanks for the Nonconformist [March 8, 1871]. I 
like to see all that is written, and it is of some real use. If 
you hear of reviewers in out-of-the-way papers, especially the 
religious, as Record, Guardian, Tablet, kindly inform me. It 
is wonderful that there has been no abuse * as yet, but I 
suppose I shall not escape. On the whole, the reviews have 
been highly favourable.” 

The following extract from a letter to Mr. Murray (April 
13, 1871) refers to a review in the Times .f 

“I have no idea who wrote the Times review. He has 
no knowledge of science, and seems to me a wind-bag full 
of metaphysics and classics, so that I do not much regard 
his adverse judgment, though I suppose it will injure the 
sale." 

A review of the ‘ Descent of Man,’ which my father spoke 
of as “ capital,” appeared in the Saturday Review (Mar. 4 
and 11, 1871). A passage from the first notice (Mar. 4) may 
be quoted in illustration of the broad basis, as regards general 
acceptance, on which the doctrine of Evolution now stood : 
“He claims to have brought man himself, his origin and 
constitution, within that unity which he had previously 
sought to trace through all lower animal forms. The growth 
of opinion in the interval, due in chief measure to his own 
intermediate works, has placed the discussion of this problem 



• “ I feel a full conviction that 
my chapter on man will excite 
attention and plenty of abuse, and 
1 suppose abuse is as good as 
praise for selling a book.”— (From 
a letter to Mr. Murray, Jan. 31, 
1867.) 

t Times, April 7 and 8, 1871. 
The review is not only unfavourable 
as regards the book under dis- 
cussion, but also as regards Evolu- 
tion in general, as the following 



citation will show : “ Even had it 
been rendered highly probable, 
which we doubt, that the animal 
creation has been developed into 
its numerous and widely different 
varieties by mere evolution, it would 
still require an independent investi- 
gation of overwhelming force and 
completeness to justify the pre- 
sumption that man isbut a term in 
this sclf-evolvipg scries.’’

in a position very much in advance of that held by it fifteen 
years ago. The problem of Evolution is hardly any longer to 
be treated as one of first principles ; nor has Mr. Darwin to 
do battle for a first hearing of his central hypothesis, upborne 
as it is by a phalanx of names full of distinction and promise, 
in either hemisphere.” 

The infolded point of the human ear, discovered by 
Mr. Woolner, and described in the ‘ Descent of Man,’ seems 
especially to have struck the popular imagination ; my father 
wrote to Mr. Woolner : — 

“ The tips to the ears have become quite celebrated. One 
reviewer (‘ Nature ’) says they ought to be called, as I sug- 
gested in joke, Angulus Woolneriatius .* A German is very 
proud to find that he has the tips well developed, and I 
believe will send me a photograph of his ears.”] 



C. Darwin to John Brodie Innes.\ 

Down, May 29 [1871]. 

My DEAR Innes, — I have been very glad to receive your 
pleasant letter, for, to tell you the truth, I have sometimes 
wondered whether you would not think me an outcast and 
a reprobate after the publication of my last book [‘ Descent ’]4 
I do not wonder at all at your not agreeing with me, for a 
good many professed naturalists do not. Yet when I see in 
how extraordinary a manner the judgment of naturalists has 
changed since I published the ‘ Origin,’ I feel convinced that 
there will be in ten years quite as much unanimity about man, 
as far as his corporeal frame is concerned. . . .

term suggested is Angulus Wool-

4 In a letter of my father’s to 
Mr. Innes, he says “ We often 



differed, but you are one of those rare 
mortals from whom one can differ 
and yet feel no shade of animosity, 
and that is a thing which I should 
feel very proud of, if any one could 
say it of me.”

[The following letters, addressed to Dr. Ogle, deal with 
the progress of the work on Expression.] 

Down, March 12 [1871]. 

Mv DEAR Dr. Ogle, — I have received both your letters, 
and they tell me all that I wanted to know in the clearest 
possible way, as, indeed, all your letters have ever done. 
I thank you cordially. I will give the case of the murderer * 
in my hobby-horse essay on Expression. I fear that the 
Eustachian tube question must have cost you a deal of 
labour; it is quite a complete little essay. It is pretty 
clear that the mouth is not opened under surprise merely to 
improve the hearing. Yet why do deaf men generally keep 
their mouths open ? The other day a man here was mimick- 
ing a deaf friend, leaning his head forward and sideways to 
the speaker, with his mouth well open ; it was a lifelike 
representation of a deaf man. Shakespeare somewhere says : 
' Hold your breath, listen ” or “ hark,” I forget which. Sur- 
prise hurries the breath, and it seems to me one can breathe, 
at least hurriedly, much quieter through the open mouth 
than through the nose. I saw the other day you doubted 
this. As objection is your province at present, I think 
breathing through the nose ought to come within it likewise, 
so do pray consider this point, and let me hear your judg- 
ment. Consider the nose to be a flower to be fertilised, and 
then you will make out all about itf I have had to allude 
to your paper on ‘ Sense of Smell;’ J is the paging right, 
namely, 1, 2, 3 ? If not, I protest by all the gods against the 
plan followed by some, of having presentation copies falsely 
paged ; and so does Rolleston, as he wrote to me the other 
day. In haste. 

Yours very sincerely,

C. Darwin to W. Ogle. 

Down, March 25 [1871]. 

My DEAR Dr. Ogle, — You will think me a horrid bore, 
but I beg you, in relation to a new point for observation, to 
imagine as well as you can that you suddenly come across 
some dreadful object, and act with a sudden little start, a 
shudder of horror ; please do this once or twice, and observe 
yourself as well as you can, and afterwards read the rest of 
this note, which I have consequently pinned down. I find, to 
my surprise, whenever I act thus my platysma contracts. Does 
yours ? (N.B. — See what a man will do for science ; I began 
this note with a horrid fib, namely, that I want you to attend 
to a new point.*) I will try and get some persons thus to act 
who are so lucky as not to know that they even possess this 
muscle, so troublesome for any one making out about expres- 
sion. Is a shudder akin to the rigor or shivering before 
fever? If so, perhaps the platysma could be observed in 
such cases. Paget told me that he had attended much to 
shivering, and had written in MS. on the subject, and been 
much perplexed about it He mentioned that passing a 
catheter often causes shivering. Perhaps I will write to him 
about the platysma. He is always most kind in aiding me in 
all ways, but he is so overworked that it hurts my conscience 
to trouble him, for I have a conscience, little as you have 
reason to think so. Help me if you can, and forgive me. 
Your murderer case has come in splendidly as the acme 
of prostration from fear. 

Yours very sincerely, 

Ch. Darwin. 

* The point was doubtless de- being directed to the platysma, a 
scribed as a new one, to avoid the muscle which had been the subject 
possibility of Dr. Ogle’s attention of discussion in other letters.

C. Darwin to Dr. Ogle. 

Down, April 29 [1871]. 

My dear Dr. Ogle, — I am truly obliged for all the 
great trouble which you have so kindly taken. I am sure 
you have no cause to say that you are sorry you can give me 
no definite information, for you have given me far more than 
I ever expected to get. The action of the platysma is not 
very important for me, but 1 believe that you will fully 
understand (for I have always fancied that our minds were 
very similar) the intolerable desire I had not to be utterly 
baffled. Now I know that it sometimes contracts from fear 
and from shuddering, but not apparently from a prolonged 
state of fear such as the insane suffer. . . . 

[Mr. Mivart’s ‘Genesis of Species,’ — a contribution to the 
literature of Evolution, which excited much attention, — was 
published in 1871, before the appearance of the ‘Descent of 
Man.’ To this book the following letter (June 21, 1871) 
from the late Chauncey Wright * to my father, refers : — 

“I send . . . revised proofs of an article which will be 
published in the July number of the ‘ North American 
Review,’ sending it in the hope that it will interest or even be 
of greater value to you. Mr. Mivart’s book [‘Genesis of 
Species ’] of which this article is substantially a review, seems 
to me a very good background from which to present the 
considerations which I have endeavoured to set forth in the 
article, in defence and illustration of the theory of Natural 



* Chauncey Wright was bom at 
Northampton, Massachusetts, Sept. 
30, 1830, and came of a family 
settled in that town since 1654. 
He became in 1852 a computer in 
the Nautical Almanac office at Cam- 
bridge, Mass., and lived a quiet un- 
eventful life, supported by the small 
stipend of his office, and by what 
he earned from his occasional 



articles, as well by a little teaching. 
He thought and read much on 
metaphysical subjects, but on the 
whole with an outcome (as far as 
the world was concerned) not com- 
mensurate to the power of his mind. 
He seems to have been a man of 
strong individuality, and to have 
made a lasting impression on his 
friends. He died in Sept 1875.

theory by placing it in its proper relations to philosophical 
inquiries in general.” * 

With regard to the proofs received from Mr. Wright, my 
father wrote to Mr. Wallace :] 



Down, July 9 [1871]. 

My dear Wallace, — I send by this post a review by 
Chauncey Wright, as I much want your opinion of it as soon 
as you can send it I consider you an incomparably better 
critic than I am. The article, though not very clearly 
written, and poor in parts from want of knowledge, seems 
to me admirable. Mivart’s book is producing a great effect 
against Natural Selection, and more especially against me 
Therefore if you think the article even somewhat good I will 
write and get permission to publish it as a shilling pamphlet, 
together with the MS. additions (enclosed), for which there 
was not room at the end of the review. . . . 

I am now at work at a new and cheap edition of the 
‘Origin,’ and shall answer several points in Mivart’s book, 
and introduce a new chapter for this purpose ; but I treat the 
subject so much more concretely, and I dare say less philo- 
sophically, than Wright, that we shall not interfere with each 
other. You will think me a bigot when I say, after studying 
Mivart, I was never before in my life so convinced of the 
general (t.e. not in detail) truth of the views in the ' Origin.' 
I grieve to see the omission of the words by Mivart, detected 
by Wright, t I complained to Mivart that in two cases he 
quotes only the commencement of sentences by me, and thus

be mentioned that the passage

C. Darwin to Chauncey Wright. 

Down, July 14, 1871. 

My DEAR Sir, — I have hardly ever in my life read an 
article which has given me so much satisfaction as the 
review which you have been so kind as to send me. I agree 
to almost everything which you say. Your memory must be 
wonderfully accurate, for you know my works as well as I do 
myself, and your power of grasping other men’s thoughts is 
something quite surprising ; and this, as far as my experience 
goes, is a very rare quality. As I read on I perceived how 
you have acquired this power, viz. by thoroughly analyzing 
each word. 

. . . Now I am going to beg a favour. Will you pro- 
visionally give me permission to reprint your article as a 
shilling pamphlet ? I ask only provisionally, as I have not 
yet had time to reflect on the subject. It would cost me, 
I fancy, with advertisements, some £ 20 or £30; but the 
worst is that, as I hear, pamphlets never will sell. And this 
makes me doubtful. Should you think it too much trouble 
to send me a title for the chance t The title ought, I think, 
to have Mr. Mivart’s name on it. 

... If you grant permission and send a title, you will 
kindly understand that I will first make further enquiries 
whether there is any chance of a pamphlet being read. 

Pray believe me yours very sincerely obliged, 

Ch. Darwin.

October 23 my father wrote to Mr. Wright : —

.... I feel very doubtful how far I shall succeed in 
answering Mivart, it is so difficult to answer objections to 
doubtful points, and make the discussion readable. I shall 
make only a selection. The worst of it is, that I cannot 
possibly hunt through all my references for isolated points, it 
would take me three weeks of intolerably hard work. I wish 
I had your power of arguing clearly. At present I feel sick 
of everything, and if I could occupy my time and forget my 
daily discomforts, or rather miseries, I would never publish 
another word. But I shall cheer up, I dare say, soon, having 
only just got over a bad attack. Farewell ; God knows why 
I bother you about myself. I can say nothing more about 
missing-links than what I have said. I should rely much on 
pre-silurian times ; but then comes Sir W. Thomson like an 
odious spectre. Farewell.

think of Mivart. I shall soon be viewed as the most despic- 
able of men. This * Quarterly Review ’ tempts me to republish 
Ch. Wright, even if not read by any one, just to show 
some one will say a word against Mivart, and that his ( u 
Mivart’s) remarks ought not to be swallowed without some 
reflection. . . . God knows whether my strength and spirit 
will last out to write a chapter versus Mivart and others ; I 
do so hate controversy and feel I shall do it so badly.

'QUARTERLY REVIEW.' 



147 



1871.] 

[The above-mentioned ‘ Quarterly ’ review was the subject of 
an article by Mr. Huxley in the November number of the 
'Contemporary Review.’ Here, also, are discussed Mr.Wallace’s 
‘Contribution to the Theory of Natural Selection,’ and the 
second edition of Mr. Mivart’s * Genesis of Species.’ What 
follows is taken from Mr. Huxley’s article. The ‘ Quarterly’ 
reviewer, though being to some extent an evolutionist, believes 
that Man “ differs more from an elephant or a gorilla, than do 
these from the dust of the earth on which they tread.” The 
reviewer also declares that my father has “ with needless op- 
position, set at naught the first principles of both philosophy 
and religion.” Mr. Huxley passes from the * Quarterly ’ re- 
viewer’s further statement, that there is no necessary opposi- 
tion between evolution and religion, to the more definite 
position taken by Mr. Mivart, that the orthodox authorities 
of the Roman Catholic Church agree in distinctly asserting 
derivative creation, so that “ their teachings harmonize with 
all that modern science can possibly require.” Here Mr. 
Huxley felt the want of that “ study of Christian philo- 
sophy” (at any rate, in its Jesuitic garb), which Mr. Mivart 
speaks of, and it was a want he at once set to work to fill up. 
He was then staying at St. Andrews, whence he wrote to 
my father : — 

“By great good luck there is an excellent library here, with 
a good copy of Suarez,* in a dozen big folios. Among these I 
dived, to the great astonishment of the librarian, and looking 
into them ‘ as the careful robin eyes the delver’s toil ’ ( vide 
‘Idylls’), I carried off the two venerable clasped volumes 
which were most promising.” Even those who know Mr. 
Huxley’s unrivalled power of tearing the heart out of a book 
must marvel at the skill with which he has made Suarez 
speak on his side. “ So I have come out,” he wrote, “ in the 
new character of a defender of Catholic orthodoxy, and upset 
Mivart out of the mouth of his own prophet.” 

* The learned Jesuit on whom Mr. Mivart mainly relies.

H 8 ‘ DESCENT OF MAN ’—EXPRESSION. [1871. 

The remainder of Mr. Huxley’s critique is largely occupied 
with a dissection of the ‘ Quarterly ’ reviewer’s psychology, and 
his ethical views. He deals, too, with Mr. Wallace’s objections 
to the doctrine of Evolution by natural causes when applied 
to the mental faculties of Man. Finally, he devotes a couple 
of pages to justifying his description of the ‘Quarterly’ 
reviewer’s “ treatment of Mr. Darwin as alike unjust and un- 
becoming.’’ 

It will be seen that the two following letters were written 
before the publication of Mr. Huxley’s article.] 

C. Darwin to T. H. Huxley. 

Down, September 31 [1871], 

My DEAR Huxley,— Your letter has pleased me in many 
ways, to a wonderful degree. . . . What a wonderful man 
you are to grapple with those old metaphysico-divinity books. 
It quite delights me that you are going to some extent to 
answer and attack Mivart. His book, as you say, has pro- 
duced a great effect ; yesterday I perceived the reverberations 
from it, even from Italy. It was this that made me ask 
Chauncey Wright to publish at my expense his article, which 
seems to me very clever, though ill-written. He has not 
knowledge enough to grapple with Mivart in detail. I think 
there can be no shadow of doubt that he is the author of the 
article in the ‘ Quarterly Review ’ . . . Iam preparing a new 
edition of the ' Origin,’ and shall introduce a new chapter in 
answer to miscellaneous objections, and shall give up the 
greater part to answer Mivart’s cases of difficulty of incipient 
structures being of no use : and I find it can be done easily. 
He never states his case fairly, and makes wonderful blunders. 

. . . The pendulum is now swinging against our side, but I 
feel positive it will soon swing the other way ; and no mortal 
man will do half as much as you in giving it a start in the 
right direction, as you did at the first commencement. God 
forgive me for writing so long and egotistical a letter; but it

Down, September 30 [1871]. 

MY dear Huxley, — It was very good of you to send the 
proof-sheets, for I was very anxious to read your article. I 
have been delighted with it. How you do smash Mivart’s 
theology : it is almost equal to your article versus Comte, — * 
that never can be transcended. . . . But I have been pre- 
eminently glad to read your discussion on [the ‘ Quarterly 1 
reviewer’s] metaphysics, especially about reason and his de- 
finition of it. I felt sure he was wrong, but having only 
common observation and sense to trust to, I did not know 
what to say in my second edition of my ‘ Descent’ Now a 
footnote and reference to you will do the work. . . . For me, 
this is one of the most important parts of the review. But for 
pleasure, I have been particularly glad that my few words t on 
the distinction, if it can be so called, between Mivart’s two 
forms of morality, caught your attention. I am so pleased 
that you take the same view, and give authorities for it ; but I 
searched Mill in vain on this head. How well you argue the 
whole case. I am mounting climax on climax ; for after all 
there is nothing, I think, better in your whole review than your

arguments v. Wallace on the intellect of savages. I must tell 
you what Hooker said to me a few years ago. “ When I read 
Huxley, I feel quite infantile in intellect.” By Jove I have 
felt the truth of this throughout your review. What a man 
you are. There are scores of splendid passages, and vivid 
flashes of wit. I have been a good deal more than merely 
pleased by the concluding part of your review ; and all the 
more, as I own I felt mortified by the accusation of bigotry, 
arrogance, &c., in the * Quarterly Review.’ But I assure you, 
he may write his worst, and he will never mortify me again. 

My dear Huxley, yours gratefully, 

Charles Darwin. 

C. Darwin to F. Miiller. 

Haredene, Albury, August 2 [1871]. 

My dear Sir, — Y our last letter has interested me greatly; 
it is wonderfully rich in facts and original thoughts. First, let 
me say that I have been much pleased by what you say 
about my book. It has had a very large sale ; but I have 
been much abused for it, especially for the chapter on the 
moral sense ; and most of my reviewers consider the book as 
a poor affair. God knows what its merits may really be ; all 
that I know is that I did my best With familiarity I think 
naturalists will accept sexual selection to a greater extent 
than they now seem inclined to do. I should very much like 
to publish your letter, but I do not see how it could be made 
intelligible, without numerous coloured illustrations, but I will 
consult Mr. Wallace on this head. I earnestly hope that you 
keep notes of all your letters and that some day you will 
publish a book : ‘ Notes of a Naturalist in S. Brazil,’ or some 
such title. Wallace will hardly admit the possibility of 
sexual selection with Lepidoptera, and no doubt it is very 
improbable. Therefore, I am very glad to hear of your cases 
(which I will quote in the next edition) of the two sets of

Hesperiadai, which display their wings differently, according to 
which surface is coloured. I cannot believe that such display 
is accidental and purposeless. . . . 

No fact of your letter has interested me more than that 
about mimicry. It is a capital fact about the males pursuing 
the wrong females. You put the difficulty of the first steps in 
imitation in a most striking and convincing manner. Your 
idea of sexual selection having aided protective imitation 
interests me greatly, for the same idea had occurred to me in 
quite different cases, viz. the dulness of all animals in the 
Galapagos Islands, Patagonia, &c., and in some other cases ; 
but I was afraid even to hint at such an idea. Would you 
object to my giving some such sentence as follows : “ F 
Muller suspects that sexual selection may have come into 
play, in aid of protective imitation, in a very peculiar manner, 
which will appear extremely improbable to those who do not 
fully believe in sexual selection. It is that the appreciation 
of certain colour is developed in those species which frequently 
behold other species thus ornamented.” Again let me thank 
you cordially for your most interesting letter. . . . 



C. Darwin to E. B. Tylor.* 

Down [Sept. 24, 1871]. 

My DEAR Sir, — I hope that you will allow me to have the 
pleasure of telling you how greatly I have been interested by 
your ‘ Primitive Culture,’ now that I have finished it It seems 
to me a most profound work, which will be certain to have 
permanent value, and to be referred to for years to come. It 
is wonderful how you trace animism from the lower races up 
to the religious belief of the highest races. It will make me 
for the future look at religion — a belief in the soul, &c. — from 
a new point of view. How curious, also, are the survivals or

rudiments of old customs. . . . You will perhaps be surprised 
at my writing at so late a period, but I have had the book 
read aloud to me, and from much ill-health of late, could only 
stand occasional short reads. The undertaking must have 
cost you gigantic labour. Nevertheless, I earnestly hope that 
you may be induced to treat morals in the same enlarged yet 
careful manner, as you have animism. I fancy from the last 
chapter that you have thought of this. No man could do the 
work so well as you, and the subject assuredly is a most 
important and interesting one. You must now possess refer- 
ences which would guide you to a sound estimation of the 
morals of savages ; and how writers like Wallace, Lubbock, 
&c. &c., do differ on this head. Forgive me for troubling 
you, and believe me, with much respect, 

Yours very sincerely, 

Ch. Darwin. 



1872. 

[At the beginning of the year the sixth edition of the 
‘Origin,’ which had been begun in June 1871, was nearly 
completed. The last sheet was revised on January 10, 1872, 
and the book was published in the course of the month. 
This volume differs from the previous ones in appearance 
and size — it consists of 458 pp. instead of 596 pp., and is a 
few ounces lighter ; it is printed on bad paper, in small type, 
and with the lines unpleasantly close together. It had, how- 
ever, one advantage over the previous editions, namely that 
it was issued at a lower price. It is to be regretted that this 
the final edition of the ‘ Origin ’ should have appeared in 
so unattractive a form ; a form which has doubtless kept many 
readers from the book. 

The discussion suggested by the ‘ Genesis of Species ’ was 
perhaps the most important addition to the book. The ob- 
jection that incipient structures cannot be of use, was dealt 
with in some detail, because it seemed to the author that this

was the point in Mr. Mivart’s book which had struck most 
readers in England. 

It is a striking proof of how wide and general had become 
the acceptance of his views, that my father found it necessary 
to insert (sixth edition, p. 424), the sentence : “ As a record 
of a former state of things, I have retained in the foregoing 
paragraphs and also elsewhere, several sentences which imply 
that naturalists believe in the separate creation of each 
species ; and I have been much censured for having thus 
expressed myself. But undoubtedly this was the general 
belief when the first edition of the present work appeared. . . 
Now things are wholly changed, and almost every naturalist 
admits the great principle of evolution." 

A small correction introduced into this sixth edition is 
connected with one of his minor papers : “ Note on the habits 
of the Pampas Woodpecker." • The paper in question was a 
reply to Mr. Hudson’s remarks on the woodpecker in a 
previous number of the same journal. The last sentence of 
my father’s paper is worth quoting for its temperate tone : 
” Finally, I trust that Mr. Hudson is mistaken when he says 
that any one acquainted with the habits of this bird might 
be induced to believe that I ‘had purposely wrested the 
truth’ in order to prove my theory. He exonerates me 
from this charge ; but I should be loath to think that there 
are many naturalists who, without any evidence, would 
accuse a fellow-worker of telling a deliberate falsehood to 
prove his theory.” In the fifth edition of the ‘ Origin,’ p. 220, 
he wrote : — 

“ Yet as I can assert not only from my own observation, but 
from that of the accurate Azara, it [the ground woodpecker] 
never climbs a tree.” In the sixth edition, p. 142, the passage 
runs “ in certain large districts it does not climb trees.” And 
he goes on to give Mr. Hudson’s statement, that in other 
regions it does frequent trees.

One of the additions in the sixth edition (p. 149), was a 
reference to Mr. A. Hyatt’s and Professor Cope’s theory of 
“ acceleration.” With regard to this he wrote (October 10, 
1872) in characteristic words to Mr. Hyatt : — 

“ Permit me to take this opportunity to express my sincere 
regret at having committed two grave errors in the last 
edition of my 1 Origin of Species,’ in my allusion to yours and 
Professor Cope’s views on acceleration and retardation of de- 
velopment I had thought that Professor Cope had preceded 
you ; but I now well remember having formerly read with 
lively interest, and marked, a paper by you somewhere in my 
library, on fossil Cephalopods with remarks on the subject. 
It seems also that I have quite misrepresented your joint 
view. This has vexed me much. I confess that I have 
never been able to grasp fully what you wish to show, and I 
presume that this must be owing to some dulness on my 
part.” 

The sixth edition of the ‘Origin’ being intended as a 
popular one, was made to include a glossary of technical 
terms, “ given because several readers have complained . . . 
that some of the terms used were unintelligible to them.” 
The glossary was compiled by Mr. Dallas, and being an 
excellent collection of clear and sufficient definitions, must 
have proved useful to many readers.]

regretting that you should expend your valuable time in

Down, April 5, 1872. 

My DEAR Sir, — I have now read your essay t with very 
great interest. Your view of the origin of local races 
through “Amixie,” is altogether new to me, and seems to 
throw an important light on an obscure problem. There is, 
however, something strange about the periods or endurance 
of variability. I formerly endeavoured to investigate the 
subject, not by looking to past time, but to species of the 
same genus widely distributed ; and I found in many cases 
that all the species, with perhaps one or two exceptions, were 
variable. It would be a very interesting subject for a con-

chologist to investigate, viz. : whether the species of the same 
genus were variable during many successive geological forma- 
tions. I began to make enquiries on this head, but failed in 
this, as in so many other things, from the want of time and 
strength. In your remarks on crossing, you do not, as it 
seems to me, lay nearly stress enough on the increased vigour 
of the offspring derived from parents which have been exposed 
to different conditions. I have during the last five years 
been making experiments on this subject with plants, and 
have been astonished at the results, which have not yet been 
published. 

In the first part of your essay, I thought that you wasted 
(to use an English expression) too much powder and shot on 
M. Wagner;* but I changed my opinion when I saw how 
admirably you treated the whole case, and how well you 
used the facts about the Planorbis. I wish I had studied 
this latter case more carefully. The manner in which, as 
you show, the different varieties blend together and make 
a constant whole, agrees perfectly with my hypothetical 
illustrations. 

Many years ago the late E. Forbes described three closely 
consecutive beds in a secondary formation, each with repre- 
sentative forms of the same fresh-water shells : the case is 
evidently analogous with that of Hilgendorf.t but the interest- 
ing connecting varieties or links were here absent I rejoice 
to think that I formerly said as emphatically as I could, that 
neither isolation nor time by themselves do anything for the 
modification of species. Hardly anything in your essay has 
pleased me so much personally, as to find that you believe to 
a certain extent in sexual selection. As far as I can judge,

very few naturalists believe in this. I may have erred on 
many points, and extended the doctrine too far, but I feel a 
strong conviction that sexual selection will hereafter be 
admitted to be a powerful agency. I cannot agree with what 
you say about the taste for beauty in animals not easily vary- 
ing. It may be suspected that even the habit of viewing 
differently coloured surrounding objects would influence their 
taste, and Fritz Miiller even goes so far as to believe that the 
sight of gaudy butterflies might influence the taste of distinct 
species. There are many remarks and statements in your 
essay which have interested me greatly, and I thank you for 
the pleasure which I have received from reading it. 

With sincere respect, I remain, 

My dear Sir, yours very faithfully, 

Charles Darwin. 

P.S. — If you should ever be induced to consider the whole 
doctrine of sexual selection, I think that you will be led to 
the conclusion, that characters thus gained by one sex are 
very commonly transferred in a greater or less degree to the 
other sex. 

[With regard to Moritz Wagner’s first Essay, my father 
wrote to that naturalist, apparently in 1868 :] 

Dear and respected Sir,— I thank you sincerely for 
sending me your ‘ Migrationsgesetz, 8tc.,’ and for the very 
kind and most honourable notice which you have taken of my 
works. That a naturalist who has travelled into so many and 
such distant regions, and who has studied animals of so many 
classes, should, to a considerable extent, agree with me, is, I 
can assure you, the highest gratification of which I am 
capable. . . . Although I saw the effects of isolation in the 
case of islands and mountain-ranges, and knew of a few 
instances of rivers, yet the greater number of your facts were 
quite unknown to me. I now see that from the want of

knowledge I did not make nearly sufficient use of the views 
which you advocate ; and I almost wish I could believe in its 
importance to the same extent with you ; for you well show, 
in a manner which never occurred to me, that it removes 
many difficulties and objections. But I must still believe that 
in many large areas all the individuals of the same species 
have been slowly modified, in the same manner, for instance, 
as the English race-horse has been improved, that is by the 
continued selection of the fleetest individuals, without any 
separation. But I admit that by this process two or more 
new species could hardly be found within the same limited 
area ; some degree of separation, if not indispensable, would 
be highly advantageous ; and here your facts and views will 
be of great value. . . . 

[The following letter bears on the same subject. It refers 
to Professor M. Wagner’s Essay, published in Das A us- 
land, May 31, 1875 :] 



C. Darwin to Moritz Wagner. 

Down, October 13, 1876. 

Dear Sir, — I have now finished reading your essays, 
which have interested me in a very high degree, notwith- 
standing that I differ much from you on various points. For 
instance, several considerations make me doubt whether 
species are much more variable at one period than at another, 
except through the agency of changed conditions. I wish, 
however, that I could believe in this doctrine, as it removes 
many difficulties. But my strongest objection to your theory 
is that it does not explain the manifold adaptations in struc- 
ture in every organic being — for instance in a Picus for 
climbing trees and catching insects — or in a Strix for catching 
animals at night, and so on ad infinitum. No theory is in 
the least satisfactory to me unless it clearly explains such

adaptations. I think that you misunderstand my views on 
isolation. I believe that all the individuals of a species can 
be slowly modified within the same district, in nearly the 
same manner as man effects by what I have called the 
process of unconscious selection. ... I do not believe that 
one species will give birth to two or more new species, as 
long as they are mingled together within the same district 
Nevertheless I cannot doubt that many new species have 
been simultaneously developed within the same large conti- 
nental area ; and in my * Origin of Species ’ I endeavoured 
to explain how two new species might be developed, 
although they met and intermingled on the borders of their 
range. It would have been a strange fact if I had over- 
looked the importance of isolation, seeing that it was such 
cases as that of the Galapagos Archipelago, which chiefly 
led me to study the origin of species. In my opinion the 
greatest error which I have committed, has been not allowing 
sufficient weight to the direct action of the environment, 
U. food, climate, &c., independently of natural selection. 
Modifications thus caused, which are neither of advantage nor 
disadvantage to the modified organism, would be especially 
favoured, as I can now see chiefly through your observations, 
by isolation in a small area, where only a few individuals 
lived under nearly uniform conditions. 

When I wrote the * Origin,’ and for some years afterwards, 
I could find little good evidence of the direct action of the 
environment ; now there is a large body of evidence, and your 
case of the Satumia is one of the most remarkable of which I 
have heard. Although we differ so greatly, I hope that you 
will permit me to express my respect for your long-continued 
and successful labours in the good cause of natural science. 

I remain, dear Sir, yours very faithfully, 

Charles Darwin.

on my father’s views on the action of isolation as regards the 
origin of new species :] 

C. Darwin to K. Semper. 

Down, November 26, 1878. 

My dear Professor Semper, — When I published the 
sixth edition of the ‘ Origin,’ I thought a good deal on the 
subject to which you refer, and the opinion therein expressed 
was my deliberate conviction. I went as far as I could, 
perhaps too far, in agreement with Wagner ; since that time I 
have seen no reason to change my mind, but then I must add 
that my attention has been absorbed on other subjects. 
There are two different classes of cases, as it appears to me, 
viz. those in which a species becomes slowly modified in the 
same country (of which I cannot doubt there are innumerable 
instances) and those cases in which a species splits into two 
or three or more new species ; and in the latter case, I should 
think nearly perfect separation would greatly aid in their 
“ specification,” to coin a new word. 

I am very glad that you are taking up this subject, for you 
will be sure to throw much light on it 1 remember well, 
long ago, oscillating much ; when I thought of the Fauna and 
Flora of the Galapagos Islands I was all for isolation, when I 
thought of S. America I doubted much. Pray believe me, 
Yours very sincerely, 

Ch. Darwin.

but I have no amanuensis at present.

Dear Professor Semper, — Since writing I have recalled 
some of the thoughts and conclusions which have passed

through ray mind of late years. In North America, in going 
from north to south or from east to west, it is clear that the 
changed conditions of life have modified the organisms in the 
different regions, so that they now form distinct races or even 
species. It is further clear that in isolated districts, however 
small, the inhabitants almost always get slightly modified, and 
how far this is due to the nature of the slightly different 
conditions to which they are exposed, and how far to mere 
interbreeding, in the manner explained by Weismann, I can 
form no opinion. The same difficulty occurred to me (as 
shown in my ‘Variation of Animals and Plants under Domesti- 
cation ') with respect to the aboriginal breeds of cattle, sheep, 
&c., in the separated districts of Great Britain, and indeed 
throughout Europe. As our knowledge advances, very slight 
differences, considered by systematists as of no importance 
in structure, are continually found to be functionally im- 
portant ; and I have been especially struck with this fact in 
the case of plants to which my observations have of late years 
been confined. Therefore it seems to me rather rash to 
consider the slight differences between representative species, 
for instance those inhabiting the different islands of the same 
archipelago, as of no functional importance, and as not in any 
way due to natural selection. With respect to all adopted 
structures, and these are innumerable, I cannot see how M. 
Wagner's view throws any light, nor indeed do I see at all 
more clearly than I did before, from the numerous cases 
which he has brought forward, how and why it is that a long 
isolated form should almost always become slightly modified. 
I do not know whether you will care about hearing my 
further opinion on the point in question, for as before 
remarked I have not attended much of late years to such 
questions, thinking it prudent, now that I am growing old, to 
work at easier subjects. 

Believe me, yours very sincerely, 

Ch. Darwin.

I hope and trust that you will throw light on these points. 

P.S. — I will add another remark which I remember 
occurred to me when I first read M. Wagner. When a 
species first arrives on a small island, it will probably increase 
rapidly, and unless all the individuals change instantaneously 
(which is improbable in the highest degree), the slowly, more 
or less, modifying offspring must intercross one with another, 
and with their unmodified parents, and any offspring not as 
yet modified. The case will then be like that of domesticated 
animals which have slowly become modified, either by the 
action of the external conditions or by the process which I 
have called the unconscious selection by man — i.e., in contrast 
with methodical selection.

C. Darwin to the Marquis de Sapor la. 

Down, April 8, 1872. 

Dear Sir, — I thank you very sincerely and feel much 
honoured by the trouble which you have taken in giving 
me your reflections on the origin of Man. It gratifies me 
extremely that some parts of my work have interested you, 
and that we agree on the main conclusion of the derivation of 
man from some lower form. 

I will reflect on what you have said, but I cannot at present 
give up my belief in the close relationship of Man to the 
higher Simise. I do not put much trust in any single cha- 
racter, even that of dentition ; but I put the greatest faith in 
resemblances in many parts of the whole organisation, for I 
cannot believe that such resemblances can be due to any 
cause except close blood relationship. That man is closely 
allied to the higher Simiae is shown by the classification of

Linnaeus, who was so good a judge of affinity. The man 
who in England knows most about the structure of the 
Simiae, namely, Mr. Mivart, and who is bitterly opposed 
to my doctrines about the derivation of the mental powers, 
yet has publicly admitted that I have not put man too 
close to the higher Simiae, as far as bodily structure is 
concerned. I do not think the absence of reversions of 
structure in man is of much weight ; C. Vogt, indeed, argues 
that [the existence of] Micro-cephalous idiots is a case of 
reversion. No one who believes in Evolution will doubt that 
the Phocae are descended from some terrestrial Carnivore. 
Yet no one would expect to meet with any such reversion 
in them. The lesser divergence of character in the races of 
man in comparison with the species of Simiadae may perhaps 
be accounted for by man having spread over the world at a 
much later period than did the Simiadae. I am fully 
prepared to admit the high antiquity of man ; but then we 
have evidence, in the Dryopithecus, of the high antiquity of 
the Anthropomorphous Simiae. 

I am glad to hear that you are at work on your fossil 
plants, which of late years have afforded so rich a field for 
discovery. With my best thanks for your great kindness, 
and with much respect, I remain, 

Dear Sir, yours very faithfully, 

Charles Darwin.

elected a foreign member of your Royal Society has pleased

appeared to me by far the highest reward to which any 
scientific man can look. My gratification has been not a 
little increased by first hearing of the honour from you.”]

‘DESCENT OF MAN ’—EXPRESSION. [1872. 
C. Darwin to Chauncey Wright. 

Down, June 3, 1872. 

My DEAR Sir, — M any thanks for your article * in the 
•North American Review,’ which I have read with great 
interest Nothing can be clearer than the way in which you 
discuss the permanence or fixity of species. It never occurred 
to me to suppose that any one looked at the case as it seems 
Mr. Mivart does. Had I read his answer to you, perhaps I 
should have perceived this ; but I have resolved to waste no 
more time in reading reviews of my works or on Evolution, 
excepting when I hear that they are good and contain new 
matter. ... It is pretty clear that Mr. Mivart has come to 
the end of his tether on this subject 

As your mind is so clear, and as you consider so carefully 
the meaning of words, I wish you would take some incidental 
occasion to consider when a thing may properly be said to be 
effected by the will of man. I have been led to the wish by 
reading an article by your Professor Whitney versus Schleicher. 
He argues, because each step of change in language is made 
by the will of man, the whole language so changes ; but I do 
not think that this is so, as man has no intention or wish to 
change the language. It is a parallel case with what I haw 
called “ unconscious selection,” which depends on men con- 
sciously preserving the best individuals, and thus uncon- 
sciously altering the breed. 

My dear Sir, yours sincerely, 

Charles Darwin. 

[Not long afterwards (September) Mr. Chauncey Wright paid 



* The proof-sheets of an article 
which appeared in the July number 
of the ‘North American Review.’ 
It was a rejoinder to Mr. Mivart’s 
reply (‘ N. Am. Review,’ April 1872) 
to Mr. Chauncey Wright’s pam- 
phlet. Chauncey Wright says of 



it (‘ Letters,’ p. 238) : — “ It is ml 
properly a rejoinder but a no 
article, repeating and expounding 
some of the points of my pamphlet, 
and answering some of Mr. Mivarfs

Sedgwick (now Mrs. William Darwin) : “ If you can imagine me

or criticism, then think of my last evening’s and this morning’s 
talks with Mr. Danvin. ... I was never so worked up in my 
life, and did not sleep many hours under the hospitable roof. 
... It would be quite impossible to give by way of report 
any idea of these talks before and at and after dinner, at 
breakfast, and at leave-taking ; and yet I dislike the egotism 
of 1 testifying ’ like other religious enthusiasts without any 
verification, or hint of similar experience.”],

indeed, admirable, and hardly less so your second article on

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, July 12 [1872]. 

My DEAR HOOKER, — I must exhale and express my joy at 
the way in which the newspapers have taken up your case. 
I have seen the Times, the Daily News, and the Pali Mall, 
and hear that others have taken up the case. 

The Memorial has done great good this way, whatever may 
be the result in the action of our wretched Government On 
my soul, it is enough to make one turn into an old honest 
Tory. . . . 

If you answer this, I shall be sorry that I have relieved my 
feelings by writing. 

Yours affectionately, 

C. Darwin. 

[The memorial here referred to was addressed to Mr. 
Gladstone, and was signed by a number of distinguished men, 
including Sir Charles Lyell, Mr. Bentham, Mr. Huxley, and 
Sir James Paget It gives a complete account of the arbitrary 
and unjust treatment received by Sir J. D. Hooker at the 
hands of his official chief, the First Commissioner of Works. 
The document is published in full in ‘Nature’ (July II, 1872), 
and is well worth studying as an example of the treatment 
which it is possible for science to receive from officialism. As 
‘Nature’ observes, it is a paper which must be read with 
the greatest indignation by scientific men in every part of the 
world, and with shame by all Englishmen. The signatories 
of the memorial conclude by protesting against the expected 
consequences of Sir Joseph Hooker’s persecution — namely his 
resignation, and the loss of “ a man honoured for his integrity,

My DEAR WALLACE, — I hate controversy, chiefly perhaps 
because 1 do it badly ; but as Dr. Bree accuses you • of “blund- 
ering,” I have thought myself bound to send the enclosed 
lettert to ‘ Nature,’ that is, if you in the least desire it In this 
case please post it If you do not at all wish it, I should 
rather prefer not sending it, and in this case please to tear it 
up. And I beg you to do the same, if you intend answering 
Dr. Bree yourself, as you will do it incomparably better 
than I should. Also please tear it up if you don’t like the 
letter. 

My dear Wallace, yours very sincerely,

C. Darwin to A. R. Wallace. 

Down, August 28, 1871 

My DEAR WALLACE, — I have at last finished the gigantic 
job of reading Dr. Bastian’s book,* and have been deeply 
interested by it You wished to hear my impression, but it 
is not worth sending. 

He seems to me an extremely able man, as, indeed, I 
thought when I read his first essay. His general argument 
in favour of Archebiosis f is wonderfully strong, though I 
cannot think much of some few of his arguments. The result 
is that I am bewildered and astonished by his statements, but 
am not convinced, though, on the whole, it seems to me pro- 
bable that Archebiosis is true. I am not convinced, partly 
I think owing to the deductive cast of much of his reasoning ; 
and I know not why, but I never feel convinced by deduction, 
even in the case of H. Spencer’s writings. If Dr. Bastian’s 
book had been turned upside down, and he had begun with 
the various cases of Heterogenesis, and then gone on to 
organic, and afterwards to saline solutions, and had then given 
his general arguments, I should have been, I believe, much 
more influenced. I suspect, however, that my chief difficulty 
is the effect of old convictions being stereotyped on my brain. 
I must have more evidence that germs, or the minutest frag- 
ments of the lowest forms, are always killed by 212“ of Fahr. 
Perhaps the mere reiteration of the statements given by 
Dr. Bastian [of] other men, whose judgment I respect, and who 
have worked long on the lower organisms, would suffice to 
convince me. Here is a fine confession of intellectual weak- 
ness ; but what an inexplicable frame of mind is that of 
belief 1 

As for Rotifers and Tardigrades being spontaneously gener-

1872.] 'BEGINNINGS OF LIFE.’ 169 

ated, my mind can no more digest such statements, whether 
true or false, than my stomach can digest a lump of lead. 
Dr. Bastian is always comparing Archebiosis, as well as 
growth, to crystallisation ; but, on this view, a Rotifer or Tardi- 
grade is adapted to its humble conditions of life by a happy 
accident, and this I cannot believe. . . . He must have 
worked with very impure materials in some cases, as plenty 
of organisms appeared in a saline solution not containing an 
atom of nitrogen. 

I wholly disagree with Dr. Bastian about many points in 
his latter chapters. Thus the frequency of generalised forms 
in the older strata seems to me clearly to indicate the common 
descent with divergence of more recent forms. Notwith- 
standing all his sneers, I do not strike my colours as yet about 
Fangenesis. I should like to live to see Archebiosis proved 
true, for it would be a discovery of transcendent importance ; 
or, if false, I should like to see’ it disproved, and the facts 
otherwise explained ; but I shall not live to see all this. If 
ever proved, Dr. Bastian will have taken a prominent part in 
the work. How grand is the onward rush of science; it is 
enough to console us for the many errors which we have com- 
mitted, and for our efforts being overlaid and forgotten in the 
mass of new facts and new views which are daily turning up. 

This is all I have to say about Dr. Bastian’s book, and it 
certainly has not been worth saying. . . . 



C. Darwin to A. De Candolle. 

Down, December n, 1872. 

My DEAR Sir — I began reading your new book * sooner 
than I intended, and when I once began, I could not stop ; 
and now you must allow me to thank you for the very great 
pleasure which it has given me. I have hardly ever read

anything more original and interesting than your treatment 
of the causes which favour the development of scientific men. 
The whole was quite new to me, and most curious. When 
I began your essay I was afraid that you were going to attack 
the principle of inheritance in relation to mind, but I soon 
found myself fully content to follow you and accept your 
limitations. I have felt, of course, special interest in the 
latter part of your work, but there was here less novelty to 
me. In many parts you do me much honour, and every- 
where more than justice. Authors generally like to hear what 
points most strike different readers, so I will mention that of 
your shorter essays, that on the future prevalence of lan- 
guages, and on vaccination interested me the most, as, indeed, 
did that on statistics, and free will. Great liability to certain 
diseases, being probably liable to atavism, is quite a new idea 
to me. At p. 322 you suggest that a young swallow ought to 
be separated, and then let loose in order to test the power 
of instinct ; but nature annually performs this experiment, 
as old cuckoos migrate in England some weeks before the 
young birds of the same year. By the way, I have just used 
the forbidden word “nature," which, after reading your 
essay, I almost determined never to use again. There 
are very few remarks in your book to which I demur, but 
when you back up Asa Gray in saying that all instincts are 
congenital habits, I must protest. 

Finally, will you permit me to ask you a question : have 
you yourself, or [has] some one who can be quite trusted, 
observed (p. 322) that the butterflies on the Alps are tamer 
than those on the lowlands ? Do they belong to the same 
species? Has this fact been observed with more than one 
species ? Are they brightly coloured kinds ? I am especially 
curious about their alighting on the brightly coloured parts 
of ladies’ dresses, more especially because I have been more 
than once assured that butterflies like bright colours, for 
instance, in India the scarlet leaves of Fointsettia.

1*72.] PUBLICATION OF THE EXPRESSION BOOK. 171 

Once again allow me to thank you for having sent me your 
work, and for the very unusual amount of pleasure which I 
have received in reading it 

With much respect, I remain, my dear Sir, 

Yours very sincerely, 

Charles Darwin. 

[The last revise of the ‘ Expression of the Emotions ’ was 
finished on August 22nd, 1872, and he wrote in his Diary : — 
* Has taken me about twelve months.” As usual he had no 
belief in the possibility of the book being generally successful. 
The following passage in a letter to Haeckel serves to show 
that he had felt the writing of this book as a somewhat 
severe strain : — 

" I have finished my little book on ‘ Expression,’ and when 
it is published in November I will of course send you a copy, 
in case you would like to read it for amusement. I have 
resumed some old botanical work, and perhaps I shall never 
again attempt to discuss theoretical views. 

“ I am growing old and weak, and no man can tell when 
his intellectual powers begin to fail Long life and happiness 
to you for your own sake and for that of science.” 

It was published in the autumn. The edition consisted of 
7000, and of these 5267 copies were sold at Mr. Murray’s sale 
in November. Two thousand were printed at the end of the 
year, and this proved a misfortune, as they did not afterwards 
sell so rapidly, and thus a mass of notes collected by the 
author was never employed for a second edition during his 
lifetime. 

Among the reviews of the * Expression of the Emotions ’ 
may be mentioned the not unfavourable notices in the At/ie- 
lueum, Nov. 9, 1872, and the Times, Dec. 13, 1872. A good 
review by Mr. Wallace appeared in the ‘ Quarterly Journal 
of Science,’ Jan. 1873. Mr. Wallace truly remarks that the 
book exhibits certain “ characteristics of the author's mind in

an eminent degree,” namely, “ the insatiable longing to dis- 
cover the causes of the varied and complex phenomena pre- 
sented by living things.” He adds that in the case of the 
author “the restless curiosity of the child to know the ‘what 
for?’ the ‘why?’ and the ‘how?’ of everything” seems 
“never to have abated its force.” 

A writer in one of the theological reviews describes the 
book as “ the most powerful and insidious ” of all the author’s 
works. 

Professor Alexander Bain criticised the book in a post- 
script to the ‘ Senses and the Intellect ; ’ to this essay the 
following letter refers :] 



C. Darwin to Alexander Bain. 

Down, October 9, 1873. 

My DEAR SIR, — I am particularly obliged to you for having 
sent me your essay. Your criticisms are all written in a 
quite fair spirit, and indeed no one who knows you or your 
works would expect anything else. What you say about the 
vagueness of what I have called the direct action of the 
nervous system, is perfectly just I felt it so at the time, and 
even more of late. I confess that I have never been able 
fully to grasp your principle of spontaneity,* as well as some 
other of your points, so as to apply them to special cases, 



* Professor Bain expounded his 
theory of Spontaneity in the essay 
here alluded to. It would be im- 
possible to do justice to it within 
the limits of a foot-note. The 
following quotations may give some 
notion of it : — 

“ By Spontaneity I understand the 
readiness to pass into movement, 
in the absence of all stimulation 
whatever; the essential requisite 
being that the nerve-centres and 



muscles shall be fresh and vigorous 
.... The gesticulations and the 
carols of young and active animals 

energy ; and although they arevety 
apt to concur with pleasing emotion, 
they have an independent source. 
.... They are not properly move- 
ments of expression ; they express 
nothing at all except an abundant 
stock of physical power.”

But as we look at everything from different points of view, it 
is not likely that we should agree closely. 

I have been greatly pleased by what you say about the 
crying expression and about blushing. Did you read a review 
in a late ‘ Edinburgh ’ ? * It was magnificently contemptuous 
towards myself and many others. 

I retain a very pleasant recollection of our sojourn together 
at that delightful place, Moor Park. 

With my renewed thanks, I remain, my dear Sir,

* The review on the ‘ Expression 
of the Emotions ’ appeared in the 
April number of the ‘ Edinburgh 
Review,’ 1873. The opening sen- 
tence is'a fair sample of the general 
tone of the article : “ Mr. Darwin has 
added another volume of amusing 
stories and grotesque illustrations 

already devoted to the exposition 
and defence of the evolutionary 
hypothesis.” A few other quota- 
tions may be worth giving. “ His 
one-sided devotion to an i priori 
scheme of interpretation seems thus 
steadily tending to impair the 
author’s hitherto unrivalled powers 
as an observer. However this may 
be, most impartial critics will, we 
think, admit that there is a marked 
falling off, both in philosophical 
tone and scientific interest, in the 
works produced since Mr. Darwin 
committed himself to the crude 
metaphysical conception so largely 



associated with his name.” The 
article is directed against Evolution 
as a whole, almost as much as 
against the doctrines of the book 
under discussion. We find through- 
out plenty of that effective style of 
criticism which consists in the use 
of such expressions as “dogma- 
tism,” “ intolerance,” “ presump- 
tuous,” “ arrogant ; ” together with 
accusations of such various faults 
as “virtual abandonment of the 
inductive method,” and the use of 
slang and vulgarisms. 

The part of the article which 
seems to have interested my father 
is the discussion on the use which 
he ought to have made of painting

say that I have just published a book on the ‘ Expression of 
the Emotions in Man and Animals and it has occurred to 
me that you might possibly like to read some parts of it ; and 
I can hardly think that this would have been the case with 
any of the books which I have already published. So I send 
by this post my present book. Although I have had no 
communication with you or the other members of your family 
for so long a time, no scenes in my whole life pass so 
frequently or so vividly before my mind as those which relate 
to happy old days spent at Woodhouse. I should very much 
like to hear a little news about yourself and the other 
members of your family, if you will take the trouble to write 
to me. Formerly I used to glean some news about you from 
my sisters. 

I have had many years of bad health and have not been 
able to visit anywhere ; and now I feel very old. As long as 
I pass a perfectly uniform life, I am able to do some daily 
work in Natural History, which is still my passion, as it was 
in old days, when you used to laugh at me for collecting 
beetles with such zeal at Woodhouse. Excepting from my 
continued ill-health, which has excluded me from society, my 
life has been a very happy one ; the greatest drawback being 
that several of my children have inherited from me feeble 
health. I hope with all my heart that you retain, at least to 
a large extent, the famous “ Owen constitution.” With 
sincere feelings of gratitude and affection for all bearing the 
name of Owen, I venture to sign myself,

that you would remain as warm-hearted and as true-hearted

well how many grievous sorrows you have gone through ; but

1873- 

[The only work (other than botanical) of this year was the 
preparation of a second edition of the ‘ Descent of Man,’ the 
publication of which is referred to in the following chapter. 
This work was undertaken much against the grain, as he was 
at the time deeply immersed in the manuscript of ‘ Insec- 
tivorous Plants.’ Thus he wrote to Mr. Wallace (Novem- 
ber 19), “ I never in my lifetime regretted an interruption so 
much as this new edition of the * Descent’ ” And later (in 
December) he wrote to Mr. Huxley : “The new edition of the 
‘ Descent ’ has turned out an awful job. It took me ten days 
merely to glance over letters and reviews with criticisms and 
new facts. It is a devil of a job.” 

The work was continued until April 1, 1874, when he was

able to return to his much loved Drosera. He wrote to 
Mr. Murray: — 

“ I have at last finished, after above three months as hard 
work as I have ever had in my life, a corrected edition of the 
4 Descent,’ and I much wish to have it printed off as soon as 
possible. As it is to be stereotyped I shall never touch it

sant visit received from Colonel Higginson of Newport, U.S.] 

C. Darwin to Thos. Wentworth Higginson. 

Down, February 27th [1873]. 

My DEAR Sir, — M y wife has just finished reading aloud 
your ‘ Life with a Black Regiment,’ and you must allow me to 
thank you heartily for the very great pleasure which it has in 
many ways given us. I always thought well of the negroes, 
from the little which I have seen of them ; and I have been 
delighted to have my vague impressions confirmed, and their 
character and mental powers so ably discussed. When you 
were here I did not know of the noble position which you had 
filled. I had formerly read about the black regiments, but 
failed to connect your name with your admirable undertaking. 
Although we enjoyed greatly your visit to Down, my wife 
and myself have over and over again regretted that we did 
not know about the black regiment, as we should have greatly 
liked to have heard a little about the South from your own lips. 

Your descriptions have vividly recalled walks taken forty 
years ago in Brazil. We have your collected Essays, which 
were kindly sent us by Mr. [Moncure] Conway, but have not 
yet had time to read them. I occasionally glean a little news 
of you in the ‘ Index ’ ; and within the last hour have read an 
interesting article of yours on the progress of Free Thought. 

Believe me, my dear Sir, with sincere admiration, 

Yours very faithfully,

Organs :”] 



C. Darwin to E. Haeckel. 

Down, September 25, 1873. 

My DEAR HACKEL, — I thank you for the present of your 
book ,• and I am heartily glad to see its great success. You 
will do a wonderful amount of good in spreading the doctrine 
of Evolution, supporting it as you do by so many original 
observations. I have read the new preface with very great 
interest. The delay in the appearance of the English trans- 
lation vexes and surprises me, for I have never been able to 
read it thoroughly in [German, and I shall assuredly do so 
when it appears in English. Has the problem of the later 
stages of reduction of useless structures ever perplexed you ? 
This problem has of late caused me much perplexity. I have 
just written a letter to ‘ Nature ’ with a hypothetical explana- 
tion of this difficulty, and I will send you the paper with the 
passage marked. I will at the same time send a paper which 
has interested me ; it need not be returned. It contains a 
singular statement bearing on so-called Spontaneous Gener- 
ation. I much wish that this latter question could be settled, 
but I see no prospect of it. If it could be proved true this 
would be most important to us. . . .

CHAPTER V. 



MISCELLANEA, INCLUDING SECOND EDITIONS OF 'CORAL 

REEFS,’ THE ‘DESCENT OF MAN,’ AND THE ‘VARIATION 

OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS.’ 

1874 AND 1875. 

[The year 1874 was given up to ‘ Insectivorous Plants,’ with 
the exception of the months devoted to the second edition of 
the ‘Descent of Man,’ (see Vol. III. p. 175) and with the further 
exception of the time given to a second edition of his ‘ Coral 
Reefs ’ (1874). The Preface to the latter states that new facts 
have been added, the whole book revised, and “the latter 
chapters almost rewritten." In the Appendix some account 
is given of Professor SempePs objections, and this was the 
occasion of correspondence between that naturalist and my 
father. In Professor Sempeds volume, ‘ Animal Life ’ (one of 
the International Series), the author calls attention to the 
subject in the following passage which I give in German, the 
published English translation being, as it seems to me, 
incorrect : “ Es scheint mir als ob er in der zweiten Ausgabe 
seines allgemein bekannten Werks iiber Korallenriffe einem 
Irrthume liber meine Beobachtungen zum Opfer gefallen ist, 
indem er die Angaben, die ich allerdings bisher immer nur 
sehr kurz gehalten hatte, vollstandig falsch wiedergegeben 
hat.” 

The proof-sheets containing this passage were sent by Pro- 
fessor Semper to my father before ‘ Animal Life ’ was published, 
and this was the occasion for the following letter, which was 
afterwards published in Professor Semper’s book.]

C. Darwin to K. Semper. 

Down, October 2, 1875. 

My dear Professor Semper,— I thank you for your 
extremely kind letter of the 19th, and for the proof-sheets. I 
believe that I understand all, excepting one or two sentences, 
where my imperfect knowledge of German has interfered. 
This is my sole and poor excuse for the mistake which 1 
made in the second edition of my ‘Coral’ book. Your 
account of the Pellew Islands is a fine addition to our know- 
ledge on coral reefs. I have very little to say on the subject, 
even if I had formerly read your account and seen your maps, 
but had known nothing of the proofs of recent elevation, 
and of your belief that the islands have not since subsided. I 
have no doubt that I should have considered them as formed 
during subsidence. But I should have been much troubled 
in my mind by the sea not being so deep as it usually is 
round atolls, and by the reef on one side sloping so gradually 
beneath the sea ; for this latter fact, as far as my memory 
serves me, is a very unusual and almost unparalleled case. I 
always foresaw that a bank at the proper depth beneath the 
surface would give rise to a reef which could not be distin- 
guished from an atoll, formed during subsidence. I must 
still adhere to my opinion, that the atolls and barrier reefs in 
the middle of the Pacific and Indian Oceans indicate subsi- 
dence ; but I fully agree with you that such cases as that of 
the Pellew Islands, if of at all frequent occurrence, would 
make my general conclusions of very little value. Future 
observers must decide between us. It will be a strange fact 
if there has not been subsidence of the beds of the great 
oceans, and if this has not affected the forms of the coral 
reefs. 

In the last three pages of the last sheet sent I am extremely 
glad to see that you are going to treat of the dispersion of 
animals. Your preliminary remarks seem to me quite ex-

cellent. There is nothing about M. Wagner, as I expected 
to find. I suppose that you have seen Moseley’s last book, 
which contains some good observations on dispersion. 

I am glad that your book will appear in English, for then I 
can read it with ease. Pray believe me, 

Yours very sincerely, 

Charles Darwin. 

[The most recent criticism on the Coral-reef theory is by 
Mr. Murray, one of the staff of the Challenger , who read a 
paper before the Royal Society of Edinburgh, April 5, 1880.* 
The chief point brought forward is the possibility of the 
building up of submarine mountains, which may serve as 
foundations for coral reefs. Mr. Murray also seeks to prove 
that “the chief features of coral reefs and islands can be 
accounted for without calling in the aid of great and general 
subsidence.” The following letter refers to this subject :] 



C. Darwin to A. Agassis. 

Down, May 5, 1881. 

. . . You will have seen Mr. Murray’s views on the forma- 
tion of atolls and barrier reefs. Before publishing my book, I 
thought long over the same view, but only as far as ordinary 
marine organisms are concerned, for at that time little was 
known of the multitude of minute oceanic organisms. I 
rejected this view, as from the few dredgings made in the 
Beagle, in the south temperate regions, I concluded that shells, 
the smaller corals, &c., decayed, and were dissolved, when not 
protected by the deposition of sediment, and sediment could 
not accumulate in the open ocean. Certainly, shells, &c., 
were in several cases completely rotten, and crumbled into 
mud between my fingers ; but you will know well whether

[I87+ 



this is in any degree common. I have expressly said that a 
bank at the proper depth would give rise to an atoll, which 
could not be distinguished from one formed during subsidence. 
I can, however, hardly believe in the former presence of as 
many banks (there having been no subsidence) as there are 
atolls in the great oceans, within a reasonable depth, on which 
minute oceanic organisms could have accumulated to the thick- 
ness of many hundred feet. . . . Pray forgive me for troubling 
you at such length, but it has occurred [to me] that you 
might be disposed to give, after your wide experience, your 
judgment. If I am wrong, the sooner I am knocked on the 
head and annihilated so much the better. It still seems to 
me a marvellous thing that there should not have been much, 
and long continued, subsidence in the beds of the great 
oceans. I wish that some doubly rich millionaire would take 
it into his head to have borings made in some of the Pacific 
and Indian atolls, and bring home cores for slicing from a 
depth of 500 or 600 feet. . . . 

[The second edition of the ‘ Descent of Man ’ was published 
in the autumn of 1874 Some severe remarks on the 
“monistic hypothesis" appeared in the July* number of 
the ‘ Quarterly Review 1 (p. 45). The reviewer expresses his 
astonishment at the ignorance of certain elementary dis- 
tinctions and principles (eg. with regard to the verbum 
mentale) exhibited, among others, by Mr. Darwin, who “docs 
not exhibit the faintest indication of having grasped them, 
yet a clear perception of them, and a direct and detailed 
examination of his facts with regard to them, was a sine qui 
non for attempting, with a chance of success, the solution of 
the mystery as to the descent of man.” 

Some further criticisms of a later date may be here alluded 
to. In the ‘Academy,’ 1876 (pp. 562, 587), appeared a review 
of Mr. Mivart’s ‘Lessons from Nature,’ by Mr. Wallace. 

* The review necessarily deals with the first edition of the ‘ Descent 
of Man.’

MR. MIVART. 



1*74-] 



185 



When considering the part of Mr. Mivart’s book relating to 
Natural and Sexual Selection, Mr. Wallace says: “In his 
violent attack on Mr. Darwin’s theories our author uses 
unusually strong language. Not content with mere argu- 
ment, he expresses ‘ reprobation of Mr. Darwin’s views ’ ; and 
asserts that though he (Mr. Darwin) has been obliged, 
virtually, to give up his theory, it is still maintained by 
Darwinians with ‘ unscrupulous audacity,’ and the actual 
repudiation of it concealed by the ‘ conspiracy of silence.’ ” 
Mr. Wallace goes on to show that these charges are without 
foundation, and points out that, “ If there is one thing more 
than another for which Mr. Darwin is pre-eminent among 
modern literary and scientific men, it is for his perfect literary 
honesty, his self-abnegation in confessing himself wrong, and 
the eager haste with which he proclaims and even magnifies 
small errors in his works, for the most part discovered by 
himself.” 

The following extract from a letter to Mr. Wallace (June 
17th) refers to Mr. Mivart’s statement (‘Lessons from Nature,’ 
p. 144) that Mr. Darwin at first studiously disguised his views 
as to the “ bestiality of man ” : — 

" I have only just heard of and procured your two articles 
in the ‘Academy.’ I thank you most cordially for your 
generous defence of me against Mr. Mivart. In the ‘ Origin ’ 
I did not discuss the derivation of any one species ; but that 
I might not be accused of concealing my opinion, I went out 
of my way, and inserted a sentence which seemed to me (and 
still so seems) to disclose plainly my belief. This was quoted 
in my ‘ Descent of Man.’ Therefore it is very unjust ... of 
Mr. Mivart to accuse me of base fraudulent concealment” 

The letter which here follows is of interest in connection 
with the discussion, in the ' Descent of Man,’ on the origin of 
the musical sense in man :]

C. Darwin to E. Gtirney.* 

Down, July 8, 1876. 

My dear Mr. Gurney, — I have read your article t with 
much interest, except the latter part, which soared above my 
ken. I am greatly pleased that you uphold my views to a 
certain extent Your criticism of the rasping noise made by 
insects being necessarily rhythmical is very good ; but though 
not made intentionally, it may be pleasing to the females, 
from the nerve cells being nearly similar in function through- 
out the animal kingdom. With respect to your letter, I 
believe that I understand your meaning, and agree with you. 
I never supposed that the different degrees and kinds of 
pleasure derived from different music could be explained by 
the musical powers of our semi-human progenitors. Docs 
not the fact that different people belonging to the same 
civilized nation are very differently affected by the same 
music, almost show that these diversities of taste and pleasure 
have been acquired during their individual lives? Your 
simile of architecture seems to me particularly good ; for in 
this case the appreciation almost must be individual, though 
possibly the sense of sublimity excited by a grand cathedral 
may have some connection with the vague feelings of terror 
and superstition in our savage ancestors, when they entered 
a great cavern or gloomy forest. I wish some one could 
analyse the feeling of sublimity. It amuses me to think how 
horrified some high-flying aesthetic men will be, at your 
encouraging such low degraded views as mine. 

Believe me, yours very sincerely, 

Charles Darwin.

Queen Anne Street, under the auspices of a well-known 
medium : 

"... We had grand fun, one afternoon, for George hired a 
medium, who made the chairs, a flute, a bell, and candlestick, 
and fiery points jump about in my brother’s dining-room, in a 
manner that astounded every one, and took away all their 
breaths. It was in the dark, but George and Hensleigh 
Wedgwood held the medium’s hands and feet on both sides 
all the time. I found it so hot and tiring that I went away 
before all these astounding miracles, or jugglery, took place. 
How the man could possibly do what was done passes my 
understanding. I came downstairs, and saw all the chairs, 
&c., on the table, which had been lifted over the heads of 
those sitting round it. 

The Lord have mercy on us all, if we have to believe 
in such rubbish. F. Galton was there, and says it was a good 
stance. ...”

present, and on which he reported to my father :]

it was, I think, really worth the exertion, as the same sort of 

things are done at all the stances, even at ’s ; and now to 

my mind an enormous weight of evidence would be requisite 
to make one believe in anything beyond mere trickery. . . . 
I am pleased to think that I declared to all my family, the 
day before yesterday, that the more I thought of all that

I was it was all imposture .... my theory was that [the

[In the spring of this year (1874) he read a book which 
gave him great pleasure and of which he often spoke with 
admiration : — The ‘ Naturalist in Nicaragua,’ by the late 
Thomas Belt Mr. Belt, whose untimely death may well be 
deplored by naturalists, was by profession an Engineer, so 
that all his admirable observations in natural history, in 
Nicaragua and elsewhere, were the fruit of his leisure. The 
book is direct and vivid in style and is full of description and 
suggestive discussions. With reference to it my father 
wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker : —

change. I observe that M. A. De Candolle has lately quoted 
you on this head versus Heer. I hope that you may be able 
to throw light on the question whether such protean, or poly-

exactly what I said, and now cannot be easy without again 
telling you how profoundly I have been gratified. Every one, 
I suppose, occasionally thinks that he has worked in vain, and 
when one of these fits overtakes me, I will think of your 
article, and if that does not dispel the evil spirit, I shall know 
that I am at the time a little bit insane, as we all are 
occasionally. 

What you say about Teleologyt pleases me especially, and I 
do not think any one else $ has ever noticed the point. I have 
always said you were the man to hit the nail on the head. 

Yours gratefully and affectionately,

your outing. In your last letter you spoke of Mr. Judd's paper 
on the Volcanoes of the Hebrides. I have just finished it, 
and to ease my mind must express my extreme admiration. 

It is years since I have read a purely geological paper 
which has interested me so greatly. I was all the more 
interested, as in the Cordillera I often speculated on the 
sources of the deluges of submarine porphyritic lavas, of 
which they are built ; and, as I have stated, I saw to a 
certain extent the causes of the obliteration of the points of 
eruption. I was also not a little pleased to see my volcanic 
book quoted, for I thought it was completely dead and 
forgotten. What fine work will Mr. Judd assuredly do! .... 
Now I have eased my mind ; and so farewell, with both 
E. D.’s and C. D.’s very kind remembrances to Miss Lyell. 

Yours affectionately, 

Charles Darwin.

C. Darwin to Aug. For el. 

Down, October 15, 1874. 

My DEAR Sir, — I have now read the whole of your admir- 
able work* and seldom in my life have I been more in- 
terested by any book. There are so many interesting facts 
and discussions, that I hardly know which to specify ; but I 
think, firstly, the newest points to me have been about the 
size of the brain in the three sexes, together with your sugges- 
tion that increase of mind-power may have led to the sterility 
of the workers. Secondly about the battles of the ants, and 
your curious account of the enraged ants being held by their 
comrades until they calmed down. Thirdly, the evidence of 
ants of the same community being the offspring of brothers 
and sisters. You admit, I think, that new communities will 
often be the product of a cross between not-related ants. 
Fritz Muller has made some interesting observations on this 
head with respect to Termites. The case of Anergates is 
most perplexing in many ways, but I have such faith in the 
law of occasional crossing that I believe an explanation will 
hereafter be found, such as the dimorphism of either sex and 
the occasional production of winged males. I see that you 
are puzzled how ants of the same community recognize each 
other; I once placed two (F. rufa) in a pill-box smelling 
strongly of asafoetida and after a day returned them to their 
homes ; they were threatened, but at last recognized. I 
made the trial thinking that they might know each other by

their odour ; but this cannot have been the case, and I have 
often fancied that they must have some common signal. 
Your last chapter is one great mass of wonderful facts and 
suggestions, and the whole profoundly interesting. I have 
seldom been more gratified than by [your] honourable mention 
of my work. 

I should like to tell you one little observation which I 
made with care many years ago ; I saw ants ( Formica rufa) 
carrying cocoons from a nest which was the largest I ever saw 
and which was well known to all the country people near, and 
an old man, apparently about eighty years of age, told me 
that he had known it ever since he was a boy. The ants 
carrying the cocoons did not appear to be emigrating; 
following the line, I saw many ascending a tall fir-tree still 
carrying their cocoons. But when I looked closely I found 
that all the cocoons were empty cases. This astonished me, 
and next day I got a man to observe with me, and we again 
saw ants bringing empty cocoons out of the nest ; each of us 
fixed on one ant and slowly followed it, and repeated the 
observation on many others. We thus found that some ants 
soon dropped their empty cocoons ; others carried them for 
many yards, as much as thirty paces, and others carried them 
high up the fir-tree out of sight Now here I think we have 
one instinct in contest with another and mistaken one. The 
first instinct being to carry the empty cocoons out of the nest, 
and it would have been sufficient to have laid them on the 
heap of rubbish, as the first breath of wind would have blown 
them away. And then came in the contest with the other 
very powerful instinct of preserving and carrying their 
cocoons as long as possible ; and this they could not help 
doing although the cocoons were empty. According as the 
one or other instinct was the stronger in each individual ant, 
so did it carry the empty cocoon to a greater or less distance. 
If this little observation should ever prove of any use to you, 
you are quite at liberty to use it. Again thanking you

C. Darwin to J. Fiske. 

Down, December 8, 1874. 

My DEAR Sir, — You must allow me to thank you for the 
very great interest with which I have at last slowly read the 
whole of your work.* I have long wished to know some- 
thing about the views of the many great men whose doctrines 
you give. With the exception of special points I did not 
even understand H. Spencer’s general doctrine ; for his style 
is too hard work for me. I never in my life read so lucid an 
expositor (and therefore thinker) as you are ; and I think 
that I understand nearly the whole — perhaps less clearly 
about Cosmic Theism and Causation than other parts. It is 
hopeless to attempt out of so much to specify what has 
interested me most, and probably you would not care to hear. 
I wish some chemist would attempt to ascertain the result of 
the cooling of heated gases of the proper kinds, in relation 
to your hypothesis of the origin of living matter. It pleased 
me to find that here and there I had arrived from my own 
crude thoughts at some of the same conclusions with you ; 
though I could seldom or never have given my reasons for 
such conclusions. I find that my mind is so fixed by the 
inductive method, that I cannot appreciate deductive reason- 
ing : I must begin with a good body of facts and not from a 
principle (in which I always suspect some fallacy) and then

as much deduction as you please. This may be very narrow- 
minded ; but the result is that such parts of H. Spencer as I 
have read with care impress my mind with the idea of his 
inexhaustible wealth of suggestion, but never convince me ; 
and so I find it with some others. I believe the cause to lie 
in the frequency with which I have found first-formed 
theories [to be] erroneous. I thank you for the honourable 
mention which you make of my works. Parts of the 
‘Descent of Man’ must have appeared laughably weak to 
you : nevertheless, I have sent you a new edition just 
published. Thanking you for the profound interest and 
profit with which I have read your work, I remain, 

My dear Sir, yours very faithfully, 

Ch. Darwin. 

1875. 

[The only work, not purely botanical, which occupied my 
father in the present year was the correction of the second 
edition of ‘ The Variation of Animals and Plants,’ and on this 
he was engaged from the beginning of July till October 3rd. 
The rest of the year was taken up with his work on in- 
sectivorous plants, and on cross-fertilisation, as will be shown 
in a later chapter. The chief alterations in the second edition 
of ‘ Animals and Plants ’ are in the eleventh chapter on “ Bud- 
variation and on certain anomalous modes of reproduction;” 
the chapter on Pangenesis "was also largely altered and re- 
modelled.” He mentions briefly some of the authors who 
have noticed the doctrine. Professor Delpino’s 1 Sulla Dar- 
winiana Teoria della Pangenesi’ (1869), an adverse but fair 
criticism, seems to have impressed him as valuable. Of 
another critic my father characteristically says,* “ Dr. Lionel 
Beale (‘Nature,’ May 11, 1871, p. 26) sneers at the whole 
doctrine with much acerbity and some justice.” He also

points out that, in Mantegazza’s ‘ Element! di Igiene,’ the 
theory of Fangenesis was clearly forestalled. 

In connection with this subject, a letter of my father’s to 
‘Nature’ (April 27, 1871) should be mentioned. A paper by 
Mr. Galton had been read before the Royal Society (March 
30, 1871) in which were described experiments, on intertrans- 
fusion of blood, designed to test the truth of the hypothesis 
of pangenesis. My father, while giving all due credit to Mr. 
Galton for his ingenious experiments, does not allow that 
pangenesis has “ as yet received its death-blow, though from 
presenting so many vulnerable points its life is always in 
jeopardy.’’ 

He seems to have found the work of correcting very 
wearisome, for he wrote : — 

“ I have no news about myself, as I am merely slaving over 
the sickening work of preparing new editions. I wish I could 
get a touch of poor Lyell’s feelings, that it was delightful to 
improve a sentence, like a painter improving a picture.” 

The feeling of effort or strain over this piece of work, is 
shown in a letter to Professor Haeckel : — 

“ What I shall do in future if I live, Heaven only knows ; 
I ought perhaps to avoid general and large subjects, as too 
difficult for me with my advancing years, and I suppose 
enfeebled brain.” 

At the end of March, in this year, the portrait for which he 
was sitting to Mr. Ouless was finished. He felt the sittings a 
great fatigue, in spite of Mr. Ouless’s considerate desire to 
spare him as far as was possible. In a letter to Sir J. D. 
Hooker he wrote, “ I look a very venerable, acute, melan- 
choly old dog ; whether I really look so I do not know.” 
The picture is in the possession of the family, and is known 
to many through M. Rajon’s etching. Mr. Ouless’s portrait 
is, in my opinion, the finest representation of my father that 
has been produced.

C. Darwin to Miss Buckley ( now Mrs. Fisher).* 

Down, February 23, 1875. 

My dear Miss Buckley, — I am grieved to hear of the 
death of my old and kind friend, though I knew that it could 
not be long delayed, and that it was a happy thing that his 
life should not have been prolonged, as I suppose that his 
mind would inevitably have suffered. I am glad that Lady 
Lyell f has been saved this terrible blow. His death makes 
me think of the time when I first saw him, and how full of 
sympathy and interest he was about what I could tell him of 
coral reefs and South America. I think that this sympathy 
with the work of every other naturalist was one of the finest 
features of his character. How completely he revolutionised 
Geology : for I can remember something of pre-Lyellian days. 

I never forget that almost everything which I have done in 
science I owe to the study of his great works. Well, he has 
had a grand and happy career, and no one ever worked with a 
truer zeal in a noble cause. It seems strange to me that I 
shall never again sit with him and Lady Lyell at their break- 
fast. I am very much obliged to you for having so kindly 
written to me. 

Pray give our kindest remembrances to Miss Lyell, and I 
hope that she has not suffered much in health, from fatigue 
and anxiety. 

Believe me, my dear Miss Buckley, 

Yours very sincerely, 

Charles Darwin.

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, February 25 [1875]. 

My dear Hooker, — Your letter so full of feeling has 
interested me greatly. I cannot say that I felt his [Lyell’s] 
death much, for I fully expected it, and have looked for some 
little time at his career as finished. 

I dreaded nothing so much as his surviving with impaired 
mental powers. He was, indeed, a noble man in very many 
ways ; perhaps in none more than in his warm sympathy with 
the work of others. How vividly I can recall my first con- 
versation with him, and how he astonished me by his interest 
in what I told him. How grand also was his candour and 
pure love of truth. Well, he is gone, and I feel as if we were 
all soon to go. ... I am deeply rejoiced about West- 
minster Abbey,* the possibility of which had not occurred to 
me when I wrote before. I did think that his works were the 
most enduring of all testimonials (as you say) to him ; but 
then I did not like the idea of his passing away with no out- 
ward sign of what scientific men thought of his merits. Now 
all this is changed, and nothing can be better than West- 
minster Abbey. Mrs. Lyell has asked me to be one of the 
pall-bearers, but I have written to say that I dared not, as I 
should so likely fail in the midst of the ceremony, and have 
my head whirling off my shoulders. All this affair must have 
cost you much fatigue and worry, and how I do wish you 
were out of England. . . . 

[In 1881 he wrote to Mrs. Fisher in reference to her article

much about his private character, otherwise his strong sense 
of humour and love of society might have been added. Also

C. Darwin to Anton Dohrn. 

Down [1875 ?]. 

My dear Dr. Dohrn, — Many thanks for your most kind 
letter. I most heartily rejoice [at your improved health and 
at the success of your grand undertaking, which will have 
so much influence on the progress of Zoology throughout 
Europe. 

If we look to England alone, what capital work has already 
been done at the Station by Balfour and Ray Lankester.. . . . 
When you come to England, I suppose that you will bring 
Mrs. Dohrn, and we shall be delighted to see you both here. 
I have often boasted that I have had a live Uhlan in my 
house ! It will be very interesting to me to read your new 
views on the ancestry of the Vertebrates. I shall be sorry to 
give up the Ascidians.to whom I feel profound gratitude ; but 
the great thing, as it appears to me, is that any link whatever 
should be found between the main divisions of the Animal 
Kingdom. . . . 

C. Darwin to August Weis matin. 

Down, December 6, 1875. 

My dear SIR, — I have been profoundly interested by your 
essay on Amblystoma,* and think that you have removed a 
great stumbling-block in the way of Evolution. I once thought 
of reversion in this case ; but in a crude and imperfect manner. 
I write now to call your attention to the sterility of moths 
when hatched out of their proper season ; I give references in 
chapter 18 of my ‘Variation under Domestication’ (vol. ii. 

• ‘ Umwandlung. dcs AxolotL’

1875 ] . VIVISECTION; 199 

p. 157, of English edition), and these cases illustrate, I think, 
the sterility of Amblystoma. Would it not be worth while to 
examine the reproductive organs of those individuals of wing- 
less Hemiptera which occasionally have wings, as in the case 
of the bed-bug? I think I have heard that the females of 
Mutilla sometimes have wings. These cases must be due to 
reversion. I dare say many anomalous cases will be hereafter 
explained on the same principle. 

I hinted at this explanation in the extraordinary case of 
the black-shouldered peacock, the so-called Pavo nigripennis 
given in my ‘ Var. under Domest ; ’ and I might have been 
bolder, as the variety is in many respects intermediate between 
the two known species. 

With much respect, 

Yours sincerely, 

Ch. Darwin. 



THE VIVISECTION QUESTION. 

[It was in November 1875 that my father gave his evidence 
before the Royal Commission on Vivisection.* I have, there- 
fore, placed together here the matter relating to this subject, 
irrespective of date. Something has already been said of my 
father’s strong feeling with regard to suffering f both in man 
and beast It was indeed one of the strongest feelings in his 
nature, and was exemplified in matters small and great, in 
his sympathy with the educational miseries of dancing dogs, 
or in his horror at the sufferings of slaves.

200 MISCELLANEA. [1875. 

The remembrance of screams, or other sounds heard in 
Brazil, when he was powerless to interfere with what he 
believed to be the torture of a slave, haunted him for years, 
especially at night. In smaller matters, where he could inter- 
fere, he did so vigorously. He returned one day from his walk 
pale and faint from having seen a horse ill-used, and from the 
agitation of violently remonstrating with the man. On 
another occasion he saw a horse-breaker teaching his son to 
ride, the little boy was frightened and the man was rough ; 
my father stopped, and jumping out of the carriage reproved 
the man in no measured terms. 

One other little incident may be mentioned, showing that 
his humanity to animals was well known in his own neigh- 
bourhood. A visitor, driving from Orpington to Down, told 
the cabman to go faster. “Why,” said the man, “if I had 
whipped the horse this much, driving Mr. Darwin, he would 
have got out of the carriage and abused me well.” 

With respect to the special point under consideration, — the 
sufferings of animals subjected to experiment, — nothing could 
show a stronger feeling than the following extract from a 
letter to Professor Ray Lankester (March 22, 1871) : — 

“ You ask about my opinion on vivisection. I quite agree 
that it is justifiable for real investigations on physiology ; but 
not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a 
subject which makes me sick with horror, so I will not say 
another word about it, else I shall not sleep to-night" 

An extract from Sir Thomas Farrer’s notes shows how 
strongly he expressed himself in a similar manner in con- 
versation : — 

“ The last time I had any conversation with him was at my 
house in Bryanston Square, just before one of his last seizures. 
He was then deeply interested in the vivisection question ; 

Some time afterwards the patient that he had undoubtedly been in- 
was discharged, and wrote to thank sane when he wrote his former 
my father for his interference, adding letter.

and what he said made a deep impression on me. He was a 
man eminently fond of animals and tender to them ; he would 
not knowingly have inflicted pain on a living creature ; but 
he entertained the strongest opinion that to prohibit experi- 
ments on living animals, would be to put a stop to the know- 
ledge of and the remedies for pain and disease." 

The Anti- Vivisection agitation, to which the following 
letters refer, seems to have become specially active in 1874, as 
may be seen, eg. by the index to ‘Nature’ for that year, in 
which the word “ Vivisection ” suddenly comes into promi- 
nence. But before that date the subject had received the 
earnest attention of biologists. Thus at the Liverpool 
Meeting of the British Association in 1870, a Committee 
was appointed, whose report defined the circumstances and 
conditions under which, in the opinion of the signatories, 
experiments on living animals were justifiable. In the spring 
of 1875, Lord Hartismere introduced a Bill into the Upper 
House to regulate the course of physiological research. 
Shortly afterwards a Bill more just towards science in its 
provisions was introduced to the House of Commons by 
Messrs. Lyon Playfair, Walpole, and Ashley. It was 
however, withdrawn on the appointment of a Royal Com- 
mission to inquire into the whole question. The Commis- 
sioners were Lords Cardwell and Winmarleigh, Mr. W. E, 
Forster, Sir J. B. Karslake, Mr. Huxley, Professor Erichssen, 
and Mr. R. H. Hutton : they commenced their inquiry in 
July, 1875, and the Report was published early in the follow- 
ing year. 

In the early summer of 1876, Lord Carnarvon’s Bill, 
entitled, “ An Act to amend the Law relating to Cruelty to 
Animals,” was introduced. It cannot be denied that the 
framers of this Bill, yielding to the unreasonable clamour of 
the public, went far beyond the recommendations of the 
Royal Commission. As a correspondent in 1 Nature ’ put it 
(1876, p. 248), “ the evidence on the strength of which legisla-

tion was recommended went beyond the facts, the Report 
went beyond the evidence, the Recommendations beyond the 
Report ; and the Bill can hardly be said to have gone beyond 
the Recommendations ; but rather to have contradicted them.” 
The legislation which my father worked for, as described 
in the following letters, was practically what was introduced 
as Dr. Lyon Playfair’s Bill.] 



C. Darwin to Mrs. Litchfield ? 

January 4, 1875. 

My DEAR H. — Your letter has led me to think over vivisec- 
tion (I wish some new word like anaes-section could be 
invented t) for some hours, and I will jot down my conclu- 
sions, which will appear very unsatisfactory to you. I have 
long thought physiology one of the greatest of sciences, sure 
sooner, or more probably later, greatly to benefit mankind ; 
but, judging from all other sciences, the benefits will accrue 
only indirectly in the search for abstract truth. It is certain 
that physiology can progress only by experiments on living 
animals. Therefore the proposal to limit research to points 
of which we can now see the bearings in regard to health, &c., 
I look at as puerile. I thought at first it would be good to 
limit vivisection to public laboratories ; but I have heard only 
of those in London and Cambridge, and I think Oxford ; but 
probably there may be a .few others. Therefore only men 
living in a few great towns would carry on investigation, and 
this I should consider a great evil. If private men were per- 
mitted to work in their own houses, and required a licence, I 
do not see who is to determine whether any particular man 
should receive one. It is young unknown men who are the

most likely to do good work. I would gladly punish severely 
any one who operated on an animal not rendered insensible, if 
the experiment made this possible ; but here again I do not 
see that a magistrate or jury could possibly determine such a 
point Therefore I conclude, if (as is likely) some experi- 
ments have been tried too often, or anaesthetics have not been 
used when they could have been, the cure must be in the 
improvement of humanitarian feelings. Under this point of 
view I have rejoiced at the present agitation. If stringent 
laws are passed, and this is likely, seeing how unscientific the 
House of Commons is, and that the gentlemen of England 
are humane, as long as their sports are not considered, which 
entail a hundred or thousand-fold more suffering than the 
experiments of physiologists — if such laws are passed, the 
result will assuredly be that physiology, which has been until 
within the last few years at a standstill in England, will 
languish or quite cease. It will then be carried on solely on 
the Continent ; and there will be so many the fewer workers 
on this grand subject, and this I should greatly regret. By 
the way, F. Balfour, who has worked for two or three years 
in the laboratory at Cambridge, declares to George that he 
has never seen an experiment, except with animals rendered 
insensible. No doubt the names of doctors will have great 
weight with the House of Commons ; but very many prac- 
titioners neither know nor care anything about the progress 
of knowledge. I cannot at present see my way to sign any 
petition, without hearing what physiologists thought would 
be its effect, and then judging for myself. I certainly could 
not sign the paper sent me by Miss Cobbe.with its monstrous 
(as it seems to me) attack on Virchow for experimenting on 
the Trichinae. I am tired and so no more. 

Yours affectionately, 
Charles Darwin.

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, April 14 [1875]. 

My DEAR Hooker. — I worked all the time in London on 
the vivisection question ; and we now think it advisable to go 
further than a mere petition. Litchfield* drew up a sketch 
of a Bill, the essential features of which have been approved 
by Sanderson, Simon and Huxley, and from conversation, 
will, I believe, be approved by Paget, and almost certainly, I 
think, by Michael Foster. Sanderson, Simon and Paget wish 
me to see Lord Derby, and endeavour to gain his advocacy 
with the Home Secretary. Now, if this is carried into effect, 
it will be of great importance to me to be able to say that the 
Bill in its essential features has the approval of some half- 
dozen eminent scientific men. I have therefore asked 
Litchfield to enclose a copy to you in its first rough form ; 
and if it is not essentially modified, may I say that it meets 
with your approval as President of the Royal Society ? The 
object is to protect animals, and at the same time not to 
injure Physiology, and Huxley and Sanderson’s approval 
almost suffices on this head. Pray let me have a line from 
you soon. 

i Yours affectionately, 

Charles Darwin. 

[The Physiological Society, which was founded in 1876, was 
in some measure the outcome of the anti-vivisection move- 
ment, since it was this agitation which impressed on Physiolo- 
gists the need of a centre for those engaged in this particular 
branch of science. With respect to the Society, my father 
wrote to Mr. Romanes (May 29, 1876): — 

“ I was very much gratified by the wholly unexpected 
honour of being elected one of the Honorary Members. 
This mark of sympathy has pleased me to a very high 
degree.”

The following letter appeared in the Times, April 18th, 
1881 :] 



C. Darwin to Frithiof Holmgren .* 

Down, April 14, 1881. 

Dear Sir, — In answer to your courteous letter of April 7, 
1 have no objection to express my opinion with respect to 
the right of experimenting on living animals. I use this latter 
expression as more correct and comprehensive than that of 
vivisection. You are at liberty to make any use of this letter 
which you may think fit, but if published I should wish the 
whole to appear. I have all my life been a strong advocate 
for humanity to animals, and have done what I could in my 
writings to enforce this duty. Several years ago, when the 
agitation against physiologists commenced in England, it 
was asserted that inhumanity was here practised, and useless 
suffering caused to animals ; and I was led to think that it 
might be advisable to have an Act of Parliament on the 
subject. I then took an active part in trying to get a Bill 
passed, such as would have removed all just cause of com- 
plaint, and at the same time have left physiologists free to 
pursue their researches, — a Bill very different from the Act 
which has since been passed. It is right to add that the 
investigation of the matter by a Royal Commission proved 
that the accusations made against our English physiologists 
were false. From all that I have heard, however, I fear that 
in some parts of Europe little regard is paid to the sufferings 
of animals, and if this be the case, I should be glad to hear of 
legislation against inhumanity in any such country. On the 
other hand, I know that physiology cannot possibly progress 
except by means of experiments on living animals, and I 
feel the deepest conviction that he who retards the progress 
of physiology commits a crime against mankind. Any one

who remembers, as I can, the state of this science half a 
century ago, must admit that it has made immense progress, 
and it is now progressing at an ever-increasing rate. What 
improvements in medical practice may be directly attributed 
to physiological research is a question which can be properly 
discussed only by those physiologists and medical practitioners 
who have studied the history of their subjects ; but, as far as 
I can learn, the benefits are already great However this may 
be, no one, unless he is grossly ignorant of what science has 
■done for mankind, can entertain any doubt of the incalculable 
benefits which will hereafter be derived from physiology, not 
•only by man, but by the lower animals. Look for instance 
at Pasteur’s results in modifying the germs of the most 
malignant diseases, from which, as it so happens, animals will 
in the first place receive more relief than man. Let it be 
remembered how many lives and what a fearful amount of 
suffering have been saved by the knowledge gained of 
parasitic worms through the experiments of Virchow and 
■others on living animals. In the future every one will be 
astonished at the ingratitude shown, at least in England, to 
these benefactors of mankind. As for myself, permit me to 
assure you that I honour, and shall always honour, every one 
who advances the noble science of physiology. 

Dear Sir, yours faithfully, 

Charles Darwin.

" Mr. Darwin and Vivisection,” signed by Miss Frances Power

C. Darwin to the Editor of the ' Times.' 

SIR, — I do not wish to discuss the views expressed by 
Miss Cobbe in the letter which appeared in the Times of the 
19th inst ; but as she asserts that I have “ misinformed ” my 
correspondent in Sweden in saying that “the investigation of 
the matter by a Royal Commission proved that the accu- 
sations made against our English physiologists were false," 
I will merely ask leave to refer to some other sentences 
from the report 'of the Commission. 

(1.) The sentence — “ It is not to be doubted that in- 
humanity may be found in persons of very high position as 
physiologists," which Miss Cobbe quotes from page 17 of the 
report, and which, in her opinion, “can necessarily concern 
English physiologists alone and not foreigners,” is imme- 
diately followed by the words “ We have seen that it was so 
in Majendie." Majendie was a French physiologist who 
became notorious some half century ago for his cruel 
experiments on living animals. 

(2.) The Commissioners, after speaking of the “general 
sentiment of humanity" prevailing in this country, say 
(p. 10):— 

“This principle is accepted generally by the very highly 
educated men whose lives are devoted either to scientific 
investigation and education or to the mitigation or the 
removal of the sufferings of their fellow-creatures ; though 
differences of degree in regard to its practical application 
will be easily discernible by those who study the evidence as 
it has been laid before us.” 

Again, according to the Commissioners (p. 10) : — 

“ The secretary of the Royal Society for the Prevention of 
Cruelty to Animals, when asked whether the general tendency 
of the scientific world in this country is at variance with 
humanity, says he believes it to be very different, indeed, 
from that of foreign physiologists ; and while giving it as the

opinion of the society that experiments are performed which 
are in their nature beyond any legitimate province of science, 
and that the pain which they inflict is pain which it is not 
justifiable to inflict even for the scientific object in view, he 
readily acknowledges that he does not know a single case of 
wanton cruelty, and that in general the English physiologists 
have used anaesthetics where they think they can do so with 
safety to the experiment" 






I am, Sir, your obedient servant, 

Charles Darwin.

My dear Romanes, — I was very glad to read your last 
note with much news interesting to me. But I write now to 
say how I, and indeed all of us in the house, have admired 
your letter in the Times.* It was so simple and direct I was 
particularly glad about Burdon Sanderson, of whom I have

view I am very glad of the publication of your letter, as I 
was at first inclined to think that I had done mischief by 
stirring up the mud. Now I feel sure that I have done good.

physiology, and I suppose, therefore, that these all originate 
with Miss Cobbe. .... Mr. Jesse complains bitterly that the

vivisection, to which Mr. Romanes wished my father to 
contribute :] 

C. Darwin to G. J. Romanes. 

Down, September 2, 1881. 

My dear Romanes, — Your letter has perplexed me 
beyond all measure. I fully recognise the duty of every one 
whose opinion is worth anything, expressing his opinion pub- 
licly on vivisection ; and this made me send my letter to the 
Times. 1 have been thinking at intervals all morning what I 
could say, and it is the simple truth that I have nothing worth 
saying. You and men like you, whose ideas flow freely, and 
who can express them easily, cannot understand the state 
of mental paralysis in which I find myself. What is most 
wanted is a careful and accurate attempt to show what physi- 
ology has already done for man, and even still more strongly 
what there is every reason to believe it will hereafter do. 
Now I am absolutely incapable of doing this, or of discussing 
the other points suggested by you. 

If you wish for my name (and I should be glad that it 
should appear with that of others in the same cause), could 
you not quote some sentence from my letter in the Times 
which I enclose, but please return it. If you thought fit you 
might say you quoted it with my approval, and that after still 
further reflection I still abide most strongly in my expressed 
conviction. 

For Heaven’s sake, do think of this. I do not grudge 
the labour and thought; but I could write nothing worth 
any one reading.

Allow me to demur to your calling your conjoint article a 
“ symposium " strictly a “ drinking party.” This seems to me 
very bad taste, and I do hope every one of you will avoid any 
semblance of a joke on the subject. I know that words, like 
a joke, on this subject have quite disgusted some persons not 
at all inimical to physiology. One person lamented to me 
that Mr. Simon, in his truly admirable Address at the Medical 
Congress (by far the best thing which I have read), spoke of 
the fantastic sensuality • (or some such term) of the many 
mistaken, but honest men and women who are half mad on 
the subject. . . ,

though obscurely written, and I agree with almost everything 
he says, except with some passages which appear to imply that

by the whole history of science.”]

[We have now to consider the work (other than botanical) 
which occupied the concluding six years of my father’s life. 
A letter to his old friend Rev. L. Blomfield (Jenyns), written 
in March, 1877, shows what was my father’s estimate of his 
own powers of work at this time : — 

“My dear Jenyns (I see I have forgotten your proper 
names), — Your extremely kind letter has given me warm 
pleasure. As one gets old, one’s thoughts turn back to the 
past rather than to the future, and I often think of the 
pleasant, and to me valuable, hours which I spent with you on 
the borders of the Fens. 

"You ask about my future work ; I doubt whether I shall 
be able to do much more that is new, and I always keep 

before my mind the example of poor old , who in his old 

age had a cacoethcs for writing. But I cannot endure doing 
nothing, so I suppose that I shall go on as long as I can 
without obviously making a fool of myself. I have a great 
mass of matter with respect to variation under nature ; but so 
much has been published since the appearance of the ' Origin 
of Species,’ that I very much doubt whether I retain power of 
mind and strength to reduce the mass into a digested whole. 
I have sometimes thought that I would try, but dread the 
attempt. . . .”

tion, but his estimate of powers which could afterwards prove 
capable of grappling with the ‘Movements of Plants,’ and 
with the work on ‘ Earthworms,’ was certainly a low one. 

The year 1876, with which the present chapter begins, 
brought with it a revival of geological work. He had been 
astonished, as I hear from Professor Judd, and as appears 
in his letters, to learn that his books on ‘ Volcanic Islands,’ 
1844, and on ‘South America,’ 1846, were still consulted 
by geologists, and it was a surprise to him that new editions 
should be required. Both these works were originally 
published by Messrs. Smith and Elder, and the new edition 
of 1876 was also brought out by them. This appeared in 
one volume with the title ‘Geological Observations on the 
Volcanic Islands, and Parts of South America visited during 
the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle . .’ He has explained in the 
preface his reasons for leaving untouched the text of the 
original editions : “ They relate to parts of the world which 
have been so rarely visited by men of science, that I am not 
aware that much could be corrected or added from observa- 
tions subsequently made. Owing to the great progress which 
Geology has made within recent times, my views on some 
few points may be somewhat antiquated ; but I have thought 
it best to leave them as they originally appeared." 

It may have been the revival of geological speculation, 
due to the revision of his early books, that led to his re- 
cording the observations of which some account is given in the 
following letter. Part of it has been published in Professor 
James Geikie’s ‘ Prehistoric Europe,’ chaps, vii. and ix.,* a few 
verbal alterations having been made at my father’s request in 
the passages quoted. Mr. Geikie lately wrote to me: “The

views suggested in his letter as to the origin of the angular 
gravels, &c., in the South of England will, I believe, come 
to be accepted as the truth. This question has a much 
wider bearing than might at first appear. In point of fact 
it solves one of the most difficult problems in Quaternary 
Geology— and has already attracted the attention of German 
geologists.’’] 

C. Darwin to James Geikie. 

Down, November 16, 1876. 

My dear Sir, — I hope that you will forgive me for 
troubling you with a very long letter. But first allow me to 
tell you with what extreme pleasure and admiration I have 
just finished reading your ‘Great Ice Age.’ It seems to me 
admirably done, and most clear. Interesting as many 
chapters are in the history of the world, I do not think that 
any one comes [up] nearly to the glacial period or periods. 
Though I have steadily read much on the subject, your book 
makes the whole appear almost new to me. 

I am now going to mention a small observation, made by 
me two or three years ago, near Southampton, but not fol- 
lowed out, as I have no strength for excursions. I need say 
nothing about the character of the drift there (which includes 
palaeolithic celts), for you have described its essential features 
in a few words at p. 506. It covers the whole country [in an] 
even plain-like surface, almost irrespective of the present 
outline of the land. 

The coarse stratification has sometimes been disturbed. I 
find that you allude “ to the larger stones often standing on 
end and this is the point which struck me so much. Not 
only moderately sized angular stones, but small oval pebbles 
often stand vertically up, in a manner which I have never seen 
in ordinary gravel beds. This fact reminded me of what 
occurs near my home, in the stiff red clay, full of unworn flints 
over the chalk, which is no doubt the residue left undissolved

by rain water. In this clay, flints as long and thin as my arm 
often stand perpendicularly up ; and I have been told by the 
tank-diggers that it is their “ natural position ” ! I presume 
that this position may safely be attributed to the differential 
movement of parts of the red clay as it subsided very slowly 
from the dissolution of the underlying chalk ; so that the 
flints arrange themselves in the lines of least resistance. The 
similar but less strongly marked arrangement of the stones in 
the drift near Southampton makes me suspect that it also 
must have slowly subsided ; and the notion has crossed my 
mind that during the commencement and height of the glacial 
period great beds of frozen snow accumulated over the south 
of England, and that, during the summer, gravel and stones 
were washed from the higher land over its surface, and 
in superficial channels. The larger streams may have cut 
right through the frozen snow, and deposited gravel in lines 
at the bottom. But on each succeeding autumn, when the 
running water failed, I imagine that the lines of drainage 
would have been filled up by blown snow afterwards con- 
gealed, and that, owing to great surface accumulations of snow, 
it would be a mere chance whether the drainage, together with 
gravel and sand, would follow the same lines during the next 
summer. Thus, as I apprehend, alternate layers of frozen 
snow and drift, in sheets and lines, would ultimately have 
covered the country to a great thickness, with lines of drift 
probably deposited in various directions at the bottom by 
the larger streams. As the climate became warmer, the 
lower beds of frozen snow would have melted with extreme 
slowness, and the many irregular beds of interstratified drift 
would have sunk down with equal slowness ; and during this 
movement the elongated pebbles would have arranged them- 
selves more or less vertically. The drift would also have been 
deposited almost irrespective of the outline of the under- 
lying land. When I viewed the country I could not per- 
suade myself that any flood, however great, could have depo-

sited such coarse gravel over the almost level platforms 
between the valleys. My view differs from that of Holst, 
p. 415 [‘Great Ice Age’], of which I had never heard, as his 
relates to channels cut through glaciers, and mine to beds 
of drift interstratified with frozen snow where no glaciers 
existed. The upshot of this long letter is to ask you to 
keep my notion in your head, and look out for upright 
pebbles in any lowland country which you may examine, 
where glaciers have not existed. Or if you think the notion 
deserves any further thought, but not otherwise, to tell any 
one of it, for instance Mr. Skertchly, who is examining such 
districts. Pray forgive me for writing so long a letter, and 
again thanking you for the great pleasure derived from your 
book, 

I remain yours very faithfully, 

Ch. Darwin. 

P.S. ... I am glad that you have read Blytt ;* his paper 
seemed to me a most important contribution to Botanical 
Geography. How curious that the same conclusions should 
have been arrived at by Mr. Skertchly, who seems to be a 
first-rate observer ; and this implies, as I always think, a 
sound theoriser. 

I have told my publisher to send you in two or three days 
a copy (second edition) of my geological work during the 
voyage of the Beagle. The sole point which would perhaps 
interest you is about the steppe-like plains of Patagonia 

For many years past I have had fearful misgivings that it 
must have been the level of the sea, and not that of the land 
which has changed.

and though I knew how kind-hearted [he was], yet the book 
has raised him greatly in my respect, notwithstanding his 
foibles and want of broad philosophical views. 

[The only other geological work of his later years was 
embodied in his book on earthworms (1881), which may 
therefore be conveniently considered in this place. This 
subject was one which had interested him many years before 
this date, and in 1838 a paper on the formation of mould 
was published in the Proceedings of the Geological Society 
(see vol. i. p. 284). 

Here he showed that “fragments of burnt marl, cinders, &c, 
which had been thickly strewed over the surface of several 
meadows were found after a few years lying at a depth of 
some inches beneath the turf, but still forming a layer.” For 
the explanation of this fact, which forms the central idea of 
the geological part of the book, he was indebted to his unde 
Josiah Wedgwood, who suggested that worms, by bringing 
earth to the surface in their castings, must undermine any 
objects lying on the surface and cause an apparent sinking. 

In the book of 1881 he extended his observations on this 
burying action, and devised a number of different ways of 
checking his estimates as to the amount of work done.* He 
also added a mass of observations on the habits, natural 
history and intelligence of worms, a part of the work which 
added greatly to its popularity. 

In 1877 Sir Thomas Farrer had discovered close to his 
garden the remains of a building of Roman-British times, 
and thus gave my father the opportunity of seeing for himself 



* He received much valuable 
help from Dr. King, of the Botanical 
Gardens, Calcutta. The following 
passage is from a letter to Dr. King, 
dated January 18, 1873

thank you enough for the immense 



trouble which you have taken.

to the points about which I was 
most anxious. If 1 had been eack

the effects produced by earthworms on the old concrete-floors, 
walls, &c. On his return he wrote to Sir Thomas Farrer : — 

"I cannot remember a more delightful week than the last. 
I know very well that E. will not believe me, but the worms 
were by no means the sole charm.” 

In the autumn of 1880, when the ‘ Power of Movements in 
Plants’ was nearly finished, he began once more on the 
subject. He wrote to Professor Carus (September 21) : — 

* In the intervals of correcting the press, I am writing a 
very little book, and have done nearly half of it. Its title 
will be (as at present designed), ‘ The Formation of Vegetable 
Mould through the Action of Worms.’ • As far as I can judge 
it will be a curious little book.” 

The manuscript was sent to the printers in April, 1881, 
and when the proof-sheets were coming in he wrote to Pro- 
fessor Carus : “ The subject has been to me a hobby-horse, and 
I have perhaps treated it in foolish detail.” 

It was published on October 10, and 2000 copies were sold 
at once. He wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker, “ I am glad that 
you approve of the ‘Worms.’ When in old days I was to 
tell you whatever I was doing, if you were at all interested, I 
always felt as most men do when their work is finally pub- 
lished.” 

To Mr. Mellard Readc he wrote (November 8) : “ It has 
been a complete surprise to me how many persons have cared 
for the subject” And to Mr. Dyer (in November) : “ My 
book has been received with almost laughable enthusiasm, 
and 3500 copies have been sold 111 ” Again, to his friend 
Mr. Anthony Rich, he wrote on February 4, 1882, “I have 
been plagued with an endless stream of letters on the sub- 
ject ; most of them very foolish and enthusiastic ; but some 
containing good facts which I have used in correcting 
yesterday the ‘ Sixth Thousand.’ ” The popularity of the

book may be roughly estimated by the fact that, in the three 
years following its publication, 8500 copies were sold— a 
sale relatively greater than that of the * Origin of Species.’ 

It is not difficult to account for its success with the non- 
scientific public. Conclusions so wide and so novel, and so 
easily understood, drawn from the study of creatures so 
familiar, and treated with unabated vigour and freshness, 
may well have attracted many readers. A reviewer remarks: 
“In the eyes of most men. . . the earthworm is a mere 
blind, dumb, senseless, and unpleasantly slimy annelid 
Mr. Darwin undertakes to rehabilitate his character, and the 
earthworm steps forth at once as an intelligent and beneficent 
personage, a worker of vast geological changes, a planer 
down of mountain sides ... a friend of man . . . and an 
ally of the Society for the preservation of ancient monu- 
ments.” The St. James's Gazette, of October 17th, 1881, 
pointed out that the teaching of the cumulative importance 
of the infinitely little is the point of contact between this 
book and the author’s previous work. 

One more book remains to be noticed, the ‘ Life of Erasmus 
Darwin.’ 

In February 1879 an essay by Dr. Ernst Krause, on the 
scientific work of Erasmus Darwin, appeared in the evolu- 
tionary journal, ‘Kosmos,’ The number of ‘Kosmos’ in 
question was a " Gratulationsheft,” * or special congratulatory 
issue in honour of my father’s birthday, so that Dr. Krause’s 
essay, glorifying the older evolutionist, was quite in its place. 
He wrote to Dr. Krause, thanking him cordially for the honour 
paid to Erasmus, and asking his permission to publish t an 
English translation of the Essay. 



* The same number contains a 
good biographical sketch of my 
father, of which the material was to 
a large extent supplied by him to 
the writer, Prof. Preyer of Jena. 
The article contains an excellent 



list of my father’s publications. 

t The wish to do so was shared 
by his brother, Erasmus Darwin 
the younger, who continued to be 
associated with the project. 



J879-] ERASMUS DARWIN. 219 

His chief reason for writing a notice of his grandfather’s 
life was “ to contradict flatly some calumnies by Miss Seward.” 
This appears from a letter of March 27, 1879, to his cousin 
Reginald Darwin, in which he asks for any documents and 
letters which might throw light on the character of Erasmus. 
This led to Mr. Reginald Darwin placing in my father’s hands 
a quantity of valuable material, including a curious folio 
common-place book, of which he wrote : " I have been 

deeply interested by the great book reading and 

looking at it is like having communion with the dead .... 
[it] has taught me a good deal about the occupations and 
tastes of our grandfather.” A subsequent letter (April 8) to 
the same correspondent describes the source of a further 
supply of material : — 

“ Since my last letter I have made a strange discovery ; 
for an old box from my father marked * Old Deeds,’ and 
which consequently I had never opened, I found full of 
letters — hundreds from Dr. Erasmus — and others from old 
members of the family : some few very curious. Also a 
drawing of Elston before it was altered, about 1750, of which 
I think I will give a copy.” 

Dr. Krause’s contribution formed the second part of the 
‘ Life of Erasmus Darwin,’ my father supplying a “ preliminary 
notice.” This expression on the title-page is somewhat mis- 
leading ; my father's contribution is more than half the book, 
and should have been described as a biography. Work of 
this kind was new to him, and he wrote doubtfully to Mr. 
Thiselton Dyer, June 18th : “God only knows what I shall 
make of his life, it is such a new kind of work to me." The 
strong interest he felt about his forebears helped to give 
zest to the work, which became a decided enjoyment to him. 
With the general public the book was not markedly success- 
ful, but many of his friends recognised its merits. Sir J. D. 
Hooker was one of these, and to him my father wrote, 
■“ Your praise of the Life of Dr. D. has pleased me exceed-

ingly, for I despised my work, and thought myself a perfect 
fool to have undertaken such a job." 

To Mr. Galton, too, he wrote, November 14 : — 

“ I am extremely glad that you approve of the little ‘Life' 
of our grandfather, for I have been repenting that I ever 
undertook it, as the work was quite beyond my tether.” 

The publication of the * Life of Erasmus Darwin ’ led to an 
attack by Mr. Samuel Butler, which amounted to a charge 
of falsehood against my father. After consulting his friends, 
he came to the determination to leave the charge unanswered, 
as being unworthy of his notice.* Those who wish to know 
more of the matter, may gather the facts of the case from Ernst 
Krause's ‘ Charles Darwin,’ and they will find Mr. Butler’s 
statement of his grievance in the Athenceum , January 31, 1880, 
and in the St. James’s Gazette, December 8, 1880. The affair 
gave my father much pain, but the warm sympathy of those 
whose opinion he respected soon helped him to let it pass into 
a well-merited oblivion. 

The following letter refers to M. J. H. Fabre’s * Souvenirs 
Entomologiques.’ It may find a place here, as it contains 
a defence of Erasmus Darwin on a small point The post- 
script is interesting, as an example of one of my father’s 
bold ideas both as to experiment and theory :] 



C. Darwin to J. H. Fabre. 

Down, January 3t, 1880. 

My dear Sir, — I hope that you will permit me to have 
the satisfaction of thanking you cordially for the lively 
pleasure which I have derived from reading your book. 
Never have the wonderful habits of insects been more vividly 
described, and it is almost as good to read about them as to

see them. I feel sure that you would not be unjust to even 
an insect, much less to a man. Now, you have been misled 
by some translator, for my grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, 
states (■ Zoonomia,’ voL i. p. 183, 1794) that it was a wasp 
(gu£pe) which he saw cutting off the wings of a large fly. I 
have no doubt that you are right in saying that the wings are 
generally cut off instinctively ; but in the case described by 
my grandfather, the wasp, after cutting off the two ends of 
the body, rose in the air, and was turned round by the wind ; 
he then alighted and cut off the wings. I must believe, with 
Pierre Huber, that insects have “ une petite dose de raison.” 
In the next edition of your book, I hope that you will alter 
fart of what you say about my grandfather. 

I am sorry that you are so strongly opposed to the Descent 
theory ; I have found the searching for the history of each 
structure or instinct an excellent aid to observation ; and 
wonderful observer as you are, it would suggest new points to 
you. If I were to write on the evolution of instincts, I could 
make good use of some of the facts which you give. Permit 
me to add, that when I read the last sentence in your book, I 
sympathised deeply with you.* 

With the most sincere respect, 

I remain, dear Sir, yours faithfully, 

Charles Darwin. 

P.S. — Allow me to make a suggestion in relation to your 
wonderful account of insects finding their way home. I for- 
merly wished to try it with pigeons : namely, to carry the 
insects in their paper “ comets,” about a hundred paces in the 
opposite direction to that which you ultimately intended to 
cany them ; but before turning round to return, to put the 
insect in a circular box, with an axle which could be made to

revolve very rapidly, first in one direction, and then in 
another, so as to destroy for a time all sense of direction in 
the insects. I have sometimes imagined that animals may 
feel in which direction they were at the first start carried.* If 
this plan failed, I had intended placing the pigeons within an 
induction coil, so as to disturb any magnetic or dia-magnetic 
sensibility, which it seems just possible that they may 
possess. C. D. 



[During the latter years of my father’s life there was a 
growing tendency in the public to do him honour. In 1877 
he received the honorary degree of LL.D.from the University 
of Cambridge. The degree was conferred on November 17, 
and with the customary Latin speech from the Public Orator, 
concluding with the words : “ Tu vero, qui leges naturae tam 
docte illustraveris, legum doctor nobis esto.” 

The honorary degree led to a movement being set on foot 
in the University to obtain some permanent memorial of my 
father. A sum of about £400 was subscribed, and after the 
rejection of the idea that a bust would be the best memorial, 
a picture was determined on. In June 1879 he sat to Mr. W. 
Richmond for the portrait in the possession of the University, 
now placed in the Library of the Philosophical Society at 
Cambridge. He is represented seated in a Doctor’s gown, 
the head turned towards the spectator : the picture has many 
admirers, but, according to my own view, neither the attitude 
nor the expression are characteristic of my father. 

A similar wish on the part of the Linnean Society — with 
which my father was so closely associated — led to his sitting 



* This idea was a favourite one 
with him, and he has described in 
* Nature’ (vol. vii. 1873, p. 360) the 
behaviour of his cob Tommy, in 
whom he fancied he detected a sense 
of direction. The horse had been 
taken by rail from Kent to the Isle of 
Wight ; when there he exhibited a 



marked desire to go eastward, even 
when his stable lay in the opposite 
direction. In the same volume of 
‘Nature,’ p. 417, is a letter on the 
‘ Origin of Certain Instincts,’ which 
contains a short discussion on the 
sense of direction.

in August, 1881, to Mr. John Collier, for the portrait now in 
the possession of the Society. Of the artist, he wrote, 
'Collier was the most considerate, kind and pleasant painter a 
sitter could desire.” The portrait represents him standing 
facing the observer in the loose cloak so familiar to those who 
knew him, and with his slouch hat in his hand. Many of 
those who knew his face most intimately, think that Mr. 
Collier’s picture is the best of the portraits, and in this 
judgment the sitter himself was inclined to agree. According 
to my feeling it is not so simple or strong a representation of 
him as that given by Mr. Ouless. There is a certain expres- 
sion in Mr. Collier’s portrait which I am inclined to consider 
an exaggeration of the almost painful expression which 
Professor Cohn has described in my father’s face, and which he 
had previously noticed in Humboldt Professor Cohn’s remarks 
occur in a pleasantly written account of a visit to Down* 
in 1876, published in the Breslauer Zcitung, April 23, 1882. 

Besides the Cambridge degree, he received about the same 
time honours of an academic kind from some foreign societies.. 

On August 5, 1878, he was elected a Corresponding 
Member of the French Institute! in the Botanical Section,! 
and wrote to Dr. Asa Gray : — 

“ I see that we are both elected Corresponding Members 



• In this connection may be 
mentioned a visit (1881) from 
another distinguished German, 
Hans Richter. The occurrence is 
otherwise worthy of mention, inas- 
much as it led to the publication, 
after my father’s death, of Herr 
Richter’s recollections of the visit 
The sketch is simply and sympa- 
thetically written, and the author 
has succeeded in giving a true 
picture of my father as he lived at 
Down. It appeared in the Neue 
Tagblatt of Vienna, and was repub- 
lished by Dr. O. Zacharias in his 



' Charles R. Darwin,’ Berlin, 1882. 

t “ Lyell always spoke of it as a 
great scandal that Darwin was so 
long kept out of the French Insti- 
tute. As he said, even if the de- 
velopment hypothesis were objected 
to, Darwin’s original works on 
Coral Reefs, the Cirripedia, and 
other subjects, constituted a more 
than sufficient claim.” — From Pro- 
fessor Judd’s notes.

than once published that he was 
elected to the Zoological Section, 
but this was not the case.

of the Institute. It is rather a good joke that I should be 
elected in the Botanical Section, as the extent of ray know- 
ledge is little more than that a daisy is a Compositous plant 
and a pea a Leguminous one.” 

In the early part of the same year he was elected a Corre- 
sponding Member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and 
he wrote (March 12) to Professor Du Bois Reymond, who had 
proposed him for election : — 

“ I thank you sincerely for your most kind letter, in which 
you announce the great honour conferred on me. The know- 
ledge of the names of the illustrious men, who seconded the 
proposal is even a greater pleasure to me than the honour itself." 

The seconders were Helmholtz, Peters, Ewald, Pringsheim 
and Virchow. 

In 1879 he received the Baly Medal of the Royal College 
of Physicians.*

BRESSA PRIZE. 



22S 



Again in 1879 he received from the Royal Academy of 
Turin the Bressa Prize for the years 1875-78, amounting 
to the sum of 12,000 francs. In the following year he 
received on his birthday, as on previous occasions, a kind 
letter of congratulation from Dr. Dohrn of Naples. In 
writing (February 15th) to thank him and the other 
naturalists at the Zoological Station, my father added : — 

“Perhaps you saw in the papers that the Turin Society 
honoured me to an extraordinary degree by awarding me 
the Bressa Prize. Now it occurred to me that if your station 
wanted some piece of apparatus, of about the value of £vx>, 
I should very much like to be allowed to pay for it Will 
you be so kind as to keep this in mind, and if any want 
should occur to you, I would send you a cheque at any 

I find from my father’s accounts that £100 was presented 
to the Naples Station. 

He received also several tokens of respect and sympathy of 
a more private character from various sources. With regard 
to such incidents, and to the estimation of the public’generally, 
his attitude may be illustrated by a passage from a letter to 
Mr. Romanes :* — 

“You have indeed passed a most magnificent eulogium 
upon me, and I wonder that you were not afraid of hearing 
‘oh! oh!’ or some other sign of disapprobation. Many 
persons think that what I have done in science has been 
much overrated, and I very often think so myself ; but my 
comfort is that I have never consciously done anything to 
gain applause. Enough and too much about my dear self.” 

Among such expressions of regard he valued very highly 
the two photographic albums received from Germany and 
Holland on his birthday, 1877. Herr Emil Rade of Munster, 
originated the idea of the German birthday gift, and under-

took the necessary arrangements. To him my father wrote 
(February 16, 1877) : — 

“ I hope that you will inform the one hundred and fifty-four 
men of science, including some of the most highly honoured 
names in the world, how grateful I am for their kindness and 
generous sympathy in having sent me their photographs on 
my birthday.” 

To Professor Haeckel he wrote (February 16, 1877) 

“ The album has just arrived quite safe. It is most superb.* 
It is by far the greatest honour which I have ever received, 
and my satisfaction has been greatly enhanced, by your most 
kind letter of February 9. ... I thank you all from my 
heart. I have written by this post to Herr Rade, and I hope 
he will somehow manage to thank all my generous friends.” 
To Professor A. van Bemmelen he wrote, on receiving a 
similar present from a number of distinguished men and 
lovers of Natural History in the Netherlands : — 

“ SIR, — I received yesterday the magnificent present of the 
album, together with your letter. I hope that you will 
endeavour to find some means to express to the two hundred 
and seventeen distinguished observers and lovers of natural 
science, who have sent me their photographs, my gratitude 
for their extreme kindness. I feel deeply gratified by this 
gift, and I do not think that any testimonial more honourable 
to me could have been imagined. I am well aware that my 
books could never have been written, and would not have 
made any impression on the public mind, had not an immense 
amount of material been collected by a long series of admir- 
able observers ; and it is to them that honour is chiefly due. 
I suppose that every worker at science occasionally feels 
depressed, and doubts whether what he has published has 
been worth the labour which it has cost him, but for the few

remaining years of my life, whenever I want cheering, I will 
look at the portraits of my distinguished co-workers in the 
field of science, and remember their generous sympathy. 
When I die, the album will be a most precious bequest to my 
children. I must further express my obligation for the very 
interesting history contained in your letter of the progress of 
opinion in the Netherlands, with respect to Evolution, the 
whole of which is quite new to me. I must again thank all 
my kind friends, from my heart, for their ever-memorable 
testimonial, and I remain, Sir, 

Your obliged and grateful servant, 

Charles R. Darwin.” 

[In the June of the following year (1878) he was gratified 
by learning that the Emperor of Brazil had expressed a wish 
to meet him. Owing to absence from home my father was 
unable to comply with this wish ; he wrote to Sir J. D. 
Hooker : — 

“ The Emperor has done so much for science, that every 
scientific man is bound to show him the utmost respect, 
and I hope that you will express in the strongest language, 
and which you can do with entire truth, how greatly I feel 
honoured by his wish to see me ; and how much I regret my 
absence from home." 

Finally it should be mentioned that in 1880 he received an 
address personally presented by members of the Council of 
the Birmingham Philosophical Society, as well as a memorial 
from the Yorkshire Naturalist Union presented by some of 
the members, headed by Dr. Sorby. He also received in the 
same year a visit from some of the members of the Lewisham 
and Blackheath Scientific Association, — a visit which was, I 
think, enjoyed by both guests and host]

MISCELLANEA ( continued ). 



MISCELLANEOUS LETTERS — 1876-1882. 

[The chief incident of a personal kind (not already dealt 
with) in the years which we are now considering was the 
death of his brother Erasmus, who died at his house in Queen 
Anne Street, on August 26th, 1881. My father wrote to 
Sir J. D. Hooker (Aug. 30) : — 

“ The death of Erasmus is a very heavy loss to all of us, for 
he had a most affectionate disposition. He always appeared 
to me the most pleasant and clearest headed man, whom I 
have ever known. London will seem a strange place to me 
without his presence ; I am deeply glad that he died without 
any great suffering, after a very short illness from mere 
weakness and not from any definite disease.* 

“ I cannot quite agree with you about the death of the old 
and young. Death in the latter case, when there is a bright 
future ahead, causes grief never to be wholly obliterated.” 
An incident of a happy character may also be selected for 
especial notice, since it was one which strongly moved my 
father’s sympathy. A letter (Dec. 17, 1879) to Sir Joseph 
Hooker shows that the possibility of a Government Pension 
being conferred on Mr. Wallace first occurred to my father at 
this time. The idea was taken up by others, and my father’s 
letters show that he felt the most lively interest in the success 
of the plan. He wrote, for instance, to Mrs. Fisher, “ I hardly 
ever wished for anything more than I do for the success 
of our plan." He was deeply pleased when this thoroughly 
deserved honour was bestowed on his friend, and wrote 
to the same correspondent (January 7, 1881), on receiving} 
letter from Mr. Gladstone announcing the fact : " How extra- 
ordinarily kind of Mr. Gladstone to find time to write undo

The letters which follow are of a miscellaneous character 
and refer principally to the books he read, and to his minor 
writings.] 



C. Darwin to Miss Buckley (Mrs. Fisher). 

Down, February 11 [1876]. 

My dear Miss Buckley,— You must let me have the 
pleasure of saying that I have just finished reading with very 
great interest your new book.f The idea seems to me a 
capital one, and as far as I can judge very well carried out. 
There is much fascination in taking a bird’s eye view of all 
the grand leading steps in the progress of science. At first I 
regretted that you had not kept each science more separate ; 
but I dare say you found it impossible. I have hardly any 
criticisms, except that I think you ought to have introduced 
Murchison as a great classifier of formations, second only to 
W. Smith. You have done full justice, and not more than 
justice, to our dear old master, Lyell. Perhaps a little more 
ought to have been said about botany, and if you should ever 
add this, you would find Sachs' 1 History,’ lately published, 
very good for your purpose. 

You have crowned Wallace and myself with much honour 
and glory. I heartily congratulate you on having produced 
so novel and interesting a work, and remain, 

My dear Miss Buckley, yours very faithfully, 

Ch. Darwin.

C. Darwin to A. R. Wallace. 

[Hopedene] •, June 5, 1876. 

My DEAR WALLACE, — I must have the pleasure of ex- 
pressing to you my unbounded admiration of your booty 
tho’ I have read only to page 184 — my object having been 
to do as little as possible while resting. I feel sure that you 
have laid a broad and safe foundation for all future work on 
Distribution. How interesting it will be to see hereafter 
plants treated in strict relation to your views ; and then all 
insects, pulmonate molluscs and fresh-water fishes, in greater 
detail than I suppose you have given to these lower animals. 
The point which has interested me most, but I do not say the 
most valuable point, is your protest against sinking imaginary 
continents in a quite reckless manner, as was stated by Forbes, 
followed, alas, by Hooker, and caricatured by Wollaston and 
[Andrew] Murray! By the way, the main impression that 
the latter author has left on my mind is his utter want of all 
scientific judgment I have lifted up my voice against the 
above view with no avail, but I have no doubt that you will 
succeed, owing to your new arguments and the coloured chart. 
Of a special value, as it seems to me, is the conclusion that 
we must determine the areas, chiefly by the nature of the 
mammals. When I worked many years ago on this subject, 
I doubted much whether the now called Palaearctic and 
Nearctic regions ought to be separated ; and I determined if I 
made another region that it should be Madagascar. I have, 
therefore, been able to appreciate your evidence on these 
points. What progress Palaeontology has made during the 
last 20 years ; but if it advances at the same rate in the 
future, our views on the migration and birth-place of the 
various groups will, I fear, be greatly altered. I cannot feel 
quite easy about the Glacial period, and the extinction of large

mammals, but I must hope that you are right. I think you 
will have to modify your belief about the difficulty of 
dispersal of land molluscs ; I was interrupted when beginning 
to cxperimentize on the just hatched young adhering to the 
feet of ground-roosting birds. I differ on one other point, 
viz. in the belief that there must have existed a Tertiary 
Antarctic continent, from which various forms radiated to the 
southern extremities of our present continents. But I could 
go on scribbling for ever. You have written, as I believe, a 
grand and memorable work which will last for years as the 
foundation for all future treatises on Geographical Distribution. 

My dear Wallace, yours very sincerely, 

Charles Darwin. 

P'S— You have paid me the highest conceivable compliment, 
by what you say of your work in relation to my chapters on 
distribution in the * Origin,’ and I heartily thank you for it 

[The following letters illustrate my father’s power of taking 
avivid interest in work bearing on Evolution, but unconnected 
with his own special researches at the time. The books 
referred to in the first letter are Professor Weismann’s

to the cause of Evolution :]

valuable. I never expected to see the coloured marks on 
caterpillars so well explained ; and the case of the ocelli 
delights me especially. . . . 

. . . There is one other subject which has always seemed 
to me more difficult to explain than even the colours of cater- 
pillars, and that is the colour of birds’ eggs, and I wish you 
would take this up. 

C. Darwin to Melchior Neumayr* Vienna. 

Down, Beckenham, Kent, March 9, 1877. 

Dear Sir, — From having been obliged to read other books, 
I finished only yesterday your essay on 1 Die Congerien,’ &cf 

I hope that you will allow me to express my gratitude for 
the pleasure and instruction which I have derived from read- 
ing it. It seems to me to be an admirable work ; and is by 
far the best case which I have ever met with, showing the 
direct influence of the conditions of life on the organization. 

Mr. Hyatt, who has been studying the Hilgendorf case, 
writes to me with respect to the conclusions at which he has 
arrived, and these are nearly the same as yours. He insists 
that closely similar forms may be derived from distinct lines 
of descent ; and this is what I formerly called analogical 
variation. There can now be no doubt that species may 
become greatly modified through the direct action of the 
environment. I have some excuse for not having formerly 
insisted more strongly on this head in my ‘ Origin of Species,’ 
as most of the best facts have been observed since its publi- 

With my renewed thanks for your most interesting essay, 
and with the highest respect, I remain, dear Sir, 

Yours very faithfully, 

Charles Darwin.

1877-] BIOGRAPHY OF AN INFANT. 233 

C. Darwin to E. S. Morse. 

Down, April 23, 1877. 

My dear Sir, — You must allow me just to tell you how 
very much I have been interested with the excellent Address * 
which you have been so kind as to send me, and which I had 
much wished to read. I believe that I had read all, or very 
nearly all, the papers by your countrymen to which you refer, 
but I have been fairly astonished at their number and im- 
portance when seeing them thus put together. I quite agree 
about the high value of Mr. Allen’s works, t as showing how 
much change may be expected apparently through the direct 
action of the conditions of life. As for the fossil remains in 
the West, no words will express how wonderful they are. 
There is one point which I regret that you did not make clear 
in your Address, namely what is the meaning and importance 
of Professors Cope and Hyatt’s views on acceleration and 
retardation. I have endeavoured, and given up in despair, 
the attempt to grasp their meaning. 

Permit me to thank you cordially for the kind feeling 
shown towards me through your Address, and I remain, my 
dear Sir, 

Yours faithfully, 

Ch. Darwin.

C. Darwin to G. Croom Robertson .* 

Down, April 27 , 1877. 

DEAR Sir, — I hope that you will be so good as to take the 
trouble to read the enclosed MS., and if you think it fit for 
publication in your admirable journal of ‘Mind,’ I shall be 
gratified. If you do not think it fit, as is very likely, will yon 
please to return it to me. I hope that you will read it in an 
extra critical spirit, as I cannot judge whether it is worth 
publishing from having been so much interested in watching 
the dawn of the several faculties in my own infant. I may 
add that I should never have thought of sending you the 
MS., had not M. Taine’s article appeared in your Journal.! 
If my MS. is printed, I think that I had better see a proof. 
I remain, dear Sir, 

Yours faithfully, 

Ch. Darwin. 

[The two following extracts show the lively interest he 
preserved in diverse fields of inquiiy. Professor Cohn, of 
Breslau, had mentioned, in a letter, Koch’s researches on 
Splenic Fever ; my father replied, January 3 : — 

“ I well remember saying to myself, between twenty and 
thirty years ago, that if ever the origin of any infectious 
disease could be proved, it would be the greatest triumph to 
science ; and now I rejoice to have seen the triumph.” 

In the spring he received a copy of Dr. E. von Mojsisovics’ 
‘Dolomit Riffe;’ his letter to the author (June 1, 1878) is 
interesting, as bearing on the influence of his own work on 
the methods of geology. 

“ I have at last found time to read the first chapter of your 
‘ Dolomit Rifle,’ and have been exceedingly interested by it

ology you indicate, by assuming the descent theory to b«

established, and then taking the graduated changes of the 
same group of organisms as the true standard ! I never 
hoped to live to see such a step even proposed by any one.” 
Another geological research which roused my father’s 
admiration was Mr. D. Mackintosh’s work on erratic blocks. 
Apart from its intrinsic merit the work keenly excited his 
sympathy from the conditions under which it was executed, 
Mr. Mackintosh being compelled to give nearly his whole 
time to tuition. The following passage is from a letter to 
Mr. Mackintosh of October 9, 1879, and refers to his paper in 
the Journal of the Geological Society, 1878 : — 

“I hope that you will allow me to have the pleasure of 
thanking you for the very great pleasure which I have derived 
from just reading your paper on erratic blocks. The map 
is wonderful, and what labour each of those lines shows 1 I 
have thought for some years that the agency of floating ice, 
which nearly half a century ago was overrated, has of late 
been underrated. You are the sole man who has ever noticed 
the distinction suggested by me* between flat or planed 
scored rocks, and mammillated scored rocks.”] 



C. Darwin to C. Ridley. 

Down, November 28, 1878. 

Dear Sir, — I just skimmed through Dr. Pusey’s sermon, 
as published in the Guardian, but it did [not] seem to me 
worthy of any attention. As I have never answered criticisms 
excepting those made by scientific men, I am not willing that 
this letter should be published ; but I have no objection to 
your saying that you sent me the three questions, and that 
I answered that Dr. Pusey was mistaken in imagining that I 
wrote the ' Origin ’ with any relation whatever to Theology. I 
should have thought that this would have been evident to

any one who had taken the trouble to read the book, more 
especially as in the opening lines of the introduction I specify 
how the subject arose in my mind. This answer disposes of 
your two other questions ; but I may add that, many years 
ago, when I was collecting facts for the ‘ Origin,’ my belief in 
what is called a personal God was as firm as that of Dr. 
Pusey himself, and as to the eternity of matter I have never 
troubled myself about such insoluble questions. Dr. Posey's 
attack will be as powerless to retard by a day the belief in 
Evolution, as were the virulent attacks made by divines fifty 
years ago against Geology, and the still older ones of the 
Catholic Church against Galileo, for the public is wise enough 
always to follow Scientific men when they agree on any 
subject ; and now there is almost complete unanimity 
amongst Biologists about Evolution, though there is still 
considerable difference as to the means, such as how far 
natural selection has acted, and how far external conditions, 
or whether there exists some mysterious innate tendency to 
perfectibility. I remain, dear Sir, 

Yours faithfully, 

Ch. Darwin. 

[Theologians were not the only adversaries of freedom in 
science. On Sept. 22, 1877, Prof. Virchow delivered an address 
at the Munich meeting of German Naturalists and Physicians, 
which had the effect of connecting Socialism with the Descent 
theory. This point of view was taken up by anti-evolu- 
tionists to such an extent that, according to Haeckel, the 
Kreus Zeitung threw “ all the blame ” of the “ treasonable 
attempts of the democrats Hodel and Nobiling . . . directly 
on the theory of Descent” Prof. Haeckel replied with vigour 
and ability in his ‘Freedom in Science and Teaching’ (Eng. 
Transl. 1879), an essay which must have the sympathy of all 
lovers of freedom.

prefer your account of Japan. For myself I hesitate between 
your discussions and description of the Southern ice, which 
seems to me admirable, and the last chapter which contained 
many facts and views new to me, though I had read your 
papers on the stony Hydroid Corals, yet your risumi made 
me realise better than I had done before, what a most curious 
case it is. 

You have also collected a surprising number of valuable 
facts bearing on the disposal of plants, far more than in any 
other book known to me. In fact your volume is a mass of 
interesting facts and discussions, with hardly a superfluous 
word ; and I heartily congratulate you on its publication.

[In November, 1879, he answered for Mr. Galton a series of 
questions for his ‘ Inquiries into Human Faculty,’ 1883. He 
wrote to Mr. Galton : — 

“ I have answered the questions as well as I could, but they 
are miserably answered, for I have never tried looking into 
my own mind. Unless others answer very much better than 
I can do, you will get no good from your queries. Do you 
not think you ought to have the age of the answerer? I 
think so, because I can call up faces of many schoolboys, not 
seen for sixty years, with much distinctness, but nowadays I 
may talk with a man for an hour, and see him several times 
consecutively, and, after a month, I am utterly unable to 
recollect what he is at all like. The picture is quite washed

[In 1880 he published a short paper in ‘Nature’ (vol 
xxi. p. 207) on the “Fertility of Hybrids from the com- 
mon and Chinese goose.” He received the hybrids from 
the Rev. Dr. Goodacre, and was glad of the opportunity of 
testing the accuracy of the statement that these species arc 
fertile inter se. This fact, which was given in the * Origin' on 
the authority of Mr. Eyton, he considered the most remark- 
able as yet recorded with respect to the fertility of hybrids. 
The fact (as confirmed by himself and Dr. Goodacre) is of 
interest as giving another proof that sterility is no criterion 
of specific difference, since the two species of goose now 
shown to be fertile inter se are so distinct that they have 
been placed by some authorities in distinct genera or sub- 
genera. 

The following letter refers to Mr. Huxley’s lecture: "The

have been, as I judge from the reports in the Standard and 
Daily News, and more especially from the accounts given me 
by three of my children. I suppose that you have not 
written out your lecture, so I fear there is no chance of its 
being printed in extenso. You appear to have piled, as on 
so many other occasions, honours high and thick on my old 
head. But I well know how great a part you have played in 
establishing and spreading the belief in the descent-theory, 
ever since that grand review in the Times and the battle 
royal at Oxford up to the present day. 

Ever, my dear Huxley, 

Yours sincerely and gratefully, 

Charles Darwin. 

P.S. — It was absurdly stupid in me, but I had read the 
announcement of your Lecture, and thought that you meant 
the maturity of the subject, until my wife one day remarked, 

“ it is almost twenty-one years since the ‘ Origin ’ appeared," 
and then for the first time the meaning of your words flashed

[In the above-mentioned lecture Mr. Huxley made a strong 
point of the accumulation of palaeontological evidence which 
the years between 1859 and 1880 have given us in favour of 
Evolution. On this subject my father wrote (August 31, 
1880):]

worthy of its contents, and I can say nothing stronger than 
this.

[In November, 1880, he received an account of a flood in 
Brazil, from which his friend Fritz Muller had barely escaped 
with his life. My father immediately wrote to Hermann Muller 
anxiously enquiring whether his brother had lost books, instru- 
ments, &c., by this accident, and begging in that case “ for the 
sake of science, so that science should not suffer,” to be allowed 
to help in making good the loss. Fortunately, however, the 
injury to Fitz Muller’s possessions was not so great as was 
expected, and the incident remains only as a memento, which 
I trust cannot be otherwise than pleasing to the survivor, of 
the friendship of the two naturalists. 

In ‘Nature’ (November 11, 1880) appeared a letter from 
my father, which is, I believe, the only instance in which 
he wrote publicly with anything like severity. The late 
Sir Wyville Thomson wrote, in the Introduction to the 
‘ Voyage of the Challenger ’ .- “ The character of the abyssal 
fauna refuses to give the least support to the theory which 
refers the evolutiori of species to extreme variation guided 
only by natural selection.” My father, after characterising 
these remarks as a “ standard of criticism, not uncommonly 
reached by theologians and metaphysicians,” goes on to take 



* Mr. Huxley has well pointed 
out (‘ Science and Culture,’ p. 317) 
that : “ In 1875, the discovery of 
the toothed birds of the cretaceous 
formation in N. America, by Prof. 
Marsh, completed the series of

exception to the term “extreme variation,” and challenges 
Sir Wyville to name any one who has "said that the evolu- 
tion of species depends only on natural selection.” The letter 
closes with an imaginary scene between Sir Wyville and a 
breeder, in which Sir Wyville criticises artificial selection in 
a somewhat similar manner. The breeder is silent, but on 
the departure of his critic he is supposed to make use of 
“emphatic but irreverent language about naturalists.” The 
letter, as originally written, ended with a quotation from 
Sedgwick on the invulnerability of those who write on what 
they do not understand, but this was omitted on the advice 
of a friend, and curiously enough a friend whose combative-

C. Darwin to G. 7. Romanes. 

Down, April 16, 1881. 

My dear Romanes, — My MS. on * Worms ’ has been sent 
to the printers, so I am going to amuse myself by scribbling 
to you on a few points ; but you must not waste your time 
in answering at any length this scribble. 

Firstly, your letter on intelligence was very useful to me 
and I tore up and re-wrote what I sent to you. I have not 
attempted to define intelligence ; but have quoted your 
remarks on experience, and have shown how far they apply 
to worms. It seems to me that they must be said to work 
with some intelligence, anyhow they are not guided by a 
blind instinct. 

Secondly, I was greatly interested by the abstract in 
' Nature ’ of your work on Echinoderms,* the complexity with 
simplicity, and with such curious co-ordination of the nervous 
system is marvellous ; and you showed me before what 
splendid gymnastic feats they can perform.

[1881. 

Thirdly, Dr. Roux has sent me a book just published by 
him: ‘ Der Kampf der Theile,’ &c., 1881 (240 pages in 
length). 

He is manifestly a well-read physiologist and pathologist, 
and from his position a good anatomist It is full of reason- 
ing, and this in German is very difficult to me, so that I have 
only skimmed through each page ; here and there reading 
with a little more care. As far as I can imperfectly judge, it 
is the most important book on Evolution which has appeared 
for some time. I believe that G. H. Lewes hinted at the 
same fundamental idea, viz. that there is a struggle going on 
within every organism between the organic molecules, the 
cells and the organs. I think that his basis is, that every cell 
which best performs its function is, in consequence, at the same 
time best nourished and best propagates its kind. The book 
does not touch on mental phenomena, but there is much 
discussion on rudimentary or atrophied parts, to which 
subject you formerly attended. Now if you would like to 
read this book, I would send it . . . If you read it, and are 
struck with it (but I may be wholly mistaken about its value), 
you would do a public service by analysing and criticising it 
in ‘Nature.’ 

Dr. Roux makes, I think, a gigantic oversight in never con- 
sidering plants ; these would simplify the problem for him. 

Fourthly, I do not know whether you will discuss in your 
book on the mind of animals any of the more complex and 
wonderful instincts. It is unsatisfactory work, as there can 
be no fossilised instincts, and the sole guide is their state in 
other members of the same order, and mere probability. 

But if you do discuss any (and it will perhaps be expected 
of you), I should think that you could not select a better case 
than that of the sand wasps, which paralyse their prey, as 
formerly described by Fabre, in his wonderful paper in the 
‘Annales des Sciences,’ and since amplified in his admirable 
‘ Souvenirs.’ 



ANIMAL INTELLIGENCE. 



245 



1881.] 

Whilst reading this latter book, I speculated a little on the 
subject Astonishing nonsense is often spoken of the sand 
wasp’s knowledge of anatomy. Now will any one say that 
the Gauchos on the plains of La Plata have such knowledge, 
yet I have often seen them pith a struggling and lassoed cow 
on the ground with unerring skill, which no mere anatomist 
could imitate. The pointed knife was infallibly driven in 
between the vertebrae by a single slight thrust I presume 
that the art was first discovered by chance, and that each 
young Gaucho sees exactly how the others do it, and then 
with a very little practice learns the art Now I suppose that 
the sand wasps originally merely killed their prey by stinging 
them in many places (see p. 129 of Fabre’s * Souvenirs,’ 
and p. 241) on the lower and softest side of the body — and 
that to sting a certain segment was found by far the most 
successful method ; and was inherited like the tendency of a 
bulldog to pin the nose of a bull, or of a ferret to bite the 
cerebellum. It would not be a very great step in advance to 
prick the ganglion of its prey only slightly, and thus to give 
its larvae fresh meat instead of old dried meat Though 
Fabre insists so strongly on the unvarying character of 
instinct yet it is shown that there is some variability, as at 
p. 176, 177. 

I fear that I shall have utterly wearied you with my 
scribbling and bad handwriting. 

My dear Romanes, yours very sincerely, 

Ch. Darwin.

to myself your remarks on one point (I hope in some degree 
correctly) in the following fashion : — 

Any character of an ancient, generalised, or intermediate 
form may, and often does, re-appear in its descendants, after 
countless generations, and this explains the extraordinarily 
complicated affinities of existing groups. This idea seems 
to me to throw a flood of light on the lines, sometimes used 
to represent affinities, which radiate in all directions, often to 
very distant sub-groups, — a difficulty which has haunted me 
for half a century. A strong case could be made out in favour 
of believing in such reversion after immense intervals of time. 
I wish the idea had been put into my head in old days, for I 
shall never again write on difficult subjects, as I have seen too 
many cases of old men becoming feeble in their minds, without 
being in the least conscious of it. If I have interpreted your 
ideas at all correctly, I hope that you will re-urge, on any fitting 
occasion, your view. I have mentioned it to a few persons 
capable of judging, and it seemed quite new to them. I beg

SIR JOSEPH HOOKER’S ADDRESS.

l88l.] 

Your idea, to show what travellers have done, seems to me 
a brilliant and just one, especially considering your audience. 

1. I know nothing about Toumefort’s works. 

2. I believe that you are fully right in calling Humboldt 
the greatest scientific traveller who ever lived. I have lately 
read two or three volumes again. His Geology is funny stuff ; 
but that merely means that he was not in advance of his age. 
I should say he was wonderful, more for his near approach to 
omniscience than for originality. Whether or not his position 
as a scientific man is as eminent as we think, you might truly 
call him the parent of a grand progeny of scientific travellers, 
who, taken together, have done much for science. 

3. It seems to me quite just to give Lyell (and secondarily 
E. Forbes) a very prominent place. 

4 Dana was, I believe, the first man who maintained the 
permanence of continents and the great oceans. . . . When I 
read the 'Challenger’s' conclusion that sediment from the 
land is not deposited at greater distances than 200 to 300 
miles from the land, I was much strengthened in my old 
belief. Wallace seems to me to have argued the case ex- 
cellently. Nevertheless, I would speak, if I were in your place, 
rather cautiously ; for T. Mellard Reade has argued lately 
with some force against the view ; but I cannot call to mind his 
arguments. If forced to express a judgment, I should abide 
by the view of approximate permanence since Cambrian days. 

5. The extreme importance of the Arctic fossil plants, is 
self-evident Take the opportunity of groaning over [our] 
ignorance of the Lignite Plants of Kerguelen Land, or any 
Antarctic land. It might do good. 

6. I cannot avoid feeling sceptical about the travelling of 
plants from the North except during the Tertiary period. It 
may of course have been so and probably was so from one 
of the two poles at the earliest period, during Pre-Cambrian 
ages; but such speculations seem to me hardly scientific, 
seeing how little we know of the old Floras. 



248 miscellanea — ( continued ). [1881. 

I will now jot down without any order a few miscellaneous 
remarks. 

I think you ought to allude to Alph. De Candolle’s great 
book, for though it (like almost everything else) is washed out 
of my mind, yet I remember most distinctly thinking it a 
very valuable work. Anyhow, you might allude to his 
excellent account of the history of all cultivated plants. 

How shall you manage to allude to your New Zealand and 
Tierra del Fuego work ? if you do not allude to them you 
will be scandalously unjust. 

The many Angiosperm plants in the Cretacean beds of the 
United States (and as far as I can judge the age of these 
beds has been fairly well made out) seems to me a fact of 
very great importance, so is their relation to the existing flora 
of the United States under an Evolutionary point of view. 
Have not some Australian extinct forms been lately found in 
Australia ? or have I dreamed it ? 

Again, the recent discovery of plants rather low down in 
our Silurian beds is very important. 

Nothing is more extraordinary in the history of the Vege- 
table Kingdom, as it seems to me, than the apparently very 
sudden or abrupt development of the higher plants. I have 
sometimes speculated whether there did not exist somewhere 
during long ages an extremely isolated continent, perhaps 
near the South Pole. 

Hence I was greatly interested by a view which Saporta 
propounded to me, a few years ago, at great length in MS. 
and which I fancy he has since published, as I urged him to 
do — viz., that as soon as flower-frequenting insects were 
developed, during the latter part of the secondary period, an 
enormous impulse was given to the development of the higher 
plants by cross-fertilization being thus suddenly formed. 

A few years ago I was much struck with Axel Blytt’s* 
Essay showing from observation, on the peat beds in Scandi-

navia, that there had apparently been long periods with more 
rain and other with less rain (perhaps connected with Croll’s 
recurrent astronomical periods), and that these periods had 
largely determined the present distribution of the plants of 
Norway and Sweden. This seemed to me a very important 

I have just read over my remarks and I fear that they will 
not be of the slightest use to you. 

I cannot but think that you have got through the hardest, 
or at least the most difficult, part of your work in having made 
so good and striking a sketch of what you intend to say ; 
but I can quite understand how you must groan over the 
great necessary labour. 

I most heartily sympathise with you on the successes of 
B. and R. : as years advance what happens to oneself 
becomes of very little consequence, in comparison with the 
careers of our children. 

Keep your spirits up, for I am convinced that you will 
make an excellent address.

you have said on Geology. I suppose that the classification 
of the Silurian and Cambrian formations must be considered 
the greatest or most important step ; for I well remember 
when all these older rocks were called grau-wacke, and 
nobody dreamed of classing them ; and now we have three 
azoic formations pretty well made out beneath the Cambrian! 
But the most striking step has been the discovery of the 
Glacial period : you are too young to remember the pro- 
digious effect this produced about the year 1840 (?) on all our 
minds. Elie de Beaumont never believed in it to the day 
of his death ! the study of the glacial deposits led to the 
study of the superficial drift, which was formerly never 
studied and called Diluvium, as I well remember. The study 
under the microscope of rock-sections is another not incon- 
siderable step. So again the making out of cleavage and the 
foliation of the metamorphic rocks. But I will not run on, 
having now eased my mind. Pray do not waste even one 
minute in acknowledging my horrid scrawls. 

Ever yours, 

Ch. Darwin.

has given me. I have rarely read anything which has inte-

From quotations which I had seen, I had a high notion of 
Aristotle’s merits, but I had not the most remote notion what 
a wonderful man he was. Linnaeus and Cuvier have been 
my two gods, though in very different ways, but they were 
mere schoolboys to old Aristotle. How very curious, also, 
his ignorance on some points, as on muscles as the means of 
movement I am glad that you have explained in so probable 
a manner some of the grossest mistakes attributed to him. I

summation of labour we owe even our common knowledge.

Down, April 3, 1882. 

Dear Sir, — A fter much deliberation, I have thought it 
best to send your very interesting paper to the Zoological 
Society, in hopes that it will be published in their Journal. 
This journal goes to every scientific institution in the world, 
and the contents are abstracted in all year-books on Zoology. 
Therefore I have preferred it to ‘Nature,’ though the latter has 
a wider circulation, but is ephemeral. 

1 have prefaced your essay by a few general remarks, to 
which I hope that you will not object. 

Of course I do not know that the Zoological Society, which 
is much addicted to mere systematic work, will publish your 
essay. If it does, I will send you copies of your essay, but 
these will not be ready for some months. If not published 
by the Zoological Society, I will endeavour to get ‘ Nature’ to 
publish it. I am very anxious that it should be published 
and preserved. Dear Sir, 

Yours faithfully, 

Ch. Darwin.

on April 18th— the day before my father's death.

is prefaced are thus the latest of my father’s writings. ]

a connected account of his botanical work, which has hitherto

CHAPTER VII. 

FERTILISATION OF FLOWERS. 

[In the letters already given we have had occasion to notice 
the general bearing of a number of botanical problems on the 
wider question of Evolution. The detailed work in botany 
which my father accomplished by the guidance of the light 
cast on the study of natural history by his own work on 
Evolution remains to be noticed. In a letter to Mr. Murray, 
September 74th, 1861, speaking of his book on the ‘Ferti- 
lisation of Orchids,’ he says : “ It will perhaps serve to 
illustrate how Natural History may be worked under the 
belief of the modification of species.” This remark gives a 
suggestion as to the value and interest of his botanical work, 
and it might be expressed in far more emphatic language 
without danger of exaggeration. 

In the same letter to Mr. Murray, he says : “ I think this 
little volume will do good to the ' Origin,’ as it will show that 
I have worked hard at details.” It is true that his botanical 
work added a mass of corroborative detail to the case for 
Evolution, but the chief support to his doctrines given by 
these researches was of another kind. They supplied an 
argument against those critics who have so freely dogmatised 
as to the uselessness of particular structures, and as to the 
consequent impossibility of their having been developed by 
means of natural selection. His observations on Orchids 
enabled him to say : “ I can show the meaning of some of 
the apparently meaningless ridges, horns ; who will now 



© The Complete Work of Charles Darwin Online 



FERTILISATION OF FLOWERS. 



255 



venture to say that this or that structure is useless?" A 
kindred point is expressed in a letter to Sir J. D. Hooker 
(May 14th, 1862) : — 

“When many parts of structure, as in the woodpecker, 
show distinct adaptation to external bodies, it is preposterous 
to attribute them to the effects of climate, &a, but when a 
single point alone, as a hooked seed, it is conceivable it may 
thus have arisen. I have found the study of Orchids emi- 
nently useful in showing me how nearly all parts of the flower 
are co-adapted for fertilisation by insects, and therefore the 
results of natural selection, — even the most trifling details of 
structure.” 

One of the greatest services rendered by my father to the 
study of Natural History is the revival of Teleology. The 
evolutionist studies the purpose or meaning of organs with 
the zeal of the older Teleology, but with far wider and more 
coherent purpose. He has the invigorating knowledge that 
he is gaining not isolated conceptions of the economy of the 
present, but a coherent view of both past and present And 
even where he fails to discover the use of any part, he may, 
by a knowledge of its structure, unravel the history of the 
past vicissitudes in the life of the species. In this way a 
vigour and unity is given to the study of the forms of 
organised beings, which before it lacked. This point has 
already been discussed in Mr. Huxley’s chapter on the 
'Reception of the Origin of Species’ and need not be 
here considered. It does, however, concern us to recognize 
that this “great service to natural science,” as Dr. Gray 
describes it, was effected almost as much by his special 
botanical work as by the ‘ Origin of Species.’ 

For a statement of the scope and influence of my father’s 
botanical work, I may refer to Mr. Thiselton Dyer’s article 
in 1 Charles Darwin,’ one of the Nature Series. Mr. Dyer’s 
wide knowledge, his friendship with my father, and especially 
his power of sympathising with the work of others, combine 



256 



FERTILISATION 



to give this essay a permanent value. The following passage 
(p. 43) gives a true picture : — 

“ Notwithstanding the extent and variety of his botanical 
work, Mr. Darwin always disclaimed any right to be regarded 
as a professed botanist. He turned his attention to plants, 
doubtless because they were convenient objects for studying 
organic phenomena in their least complicated forms ; and this 
point of view, which, if one may use the expression without 
disrespect, had something of the amateur about it, was in 
itself of the greatest importance. For, from not being, till he 
took up any point, familiar with the literature bearing on it, 
his mind was absolutely free from any prepossession. He 
was never afraid of his facts, or of framing any hypothesis, 
however startling, which seemed to explain them. ... In any 
one else such an attitude would have produced much work 
that was crude and rash. But Mr. Darwin — if one may 
venture on language which will strike no one who had con- 
versed with him as over-strained — seemed by gentle persua- 
sion to have penetrated that reserve of nature which baffles 
smaller men. In other words, his long experience had given 
him a kind of instinctive insight into the method of attack of 
any biological problem, however unfamiliar to him, while he 
rigidly controlled the fertility of his mind in hypothetical 
explanations by the no less fertility of ingeniously devised 
experiment” 

To form any just idea of the greatness of the revolution 
worked by my father’s researches in the study of the fertilisa- 
tion of flowers, it is necessary to know from what a condition 
this branch of knowledge has emerged. It should be re- 
membered that it was only during the early years of the 
present century that the idea of sex, as applied to plants, 
became firmly established. Sachs, in his ‘ History of Botany’ 
(1875), has given some striking illustrations of the remark- 
able slowness with which its acceptance gained ground. He 
remarks that when we consider the experimental proofs given

OF FLOWERS. 



257 



by Camerarius (1694)1 and by Kolreuter (1761-66), it appears 
incredible that doubts should afterwards have been raised as 
to the sexuality of plants. Yet he shows that such doubts 
did actually repeatedly crop up. These adverse criticisms 
rested for the most part on careless experiments, but in many 
cases on d priori arguments. Even as late as 1820, a book of 
this kind, which would now rank with circle squaring, or flat- 
earth philosophy, was seriously noticed in a botanical journal. 

A distinct conception of sex as applied to plants had not 
long emerged from the mists of profitless discussion and 
feeble experiment, at the time when my father began botany 
by attending Henslow’s lectures at Cambridge. 

When the belief in the sexuality of plants had become 
established as an incontrovertible piece of knowledge, a 
weight of misconception remained, weighing down any 
rational view of the subject Camerarius * believed (naturally 
enough in his day) that hermaphrodite flowers are necessarily 
self-fertilised. He had the wit to be astonished at this, a 
degree of intelligence which, as Sachs points out, the majority 
of his successors did not attain to. 

The following extracts from a note-book show that this, 
point occurred to my father as early as 1837 : — 

"Do not plants which have male and female organs 
together [i.e. in the same flower] yet receive influence from- 
other plants ? Does not Lyell give some argument about 
varieties being difficult to keep [true] on account of pollen 
from other plants ? Because this may be applied to show all 
plants do receive intermixture.” 

Sprengel,f indeed, understood that the hermaphrodite 
structure of flowers by no means necessarily leads to self- 
fertilisation. But although he discovered that in many cases 
pollen is of necessity carried to the stigma of another flower ; 
he did not understand that in the advantage gained by the

FERTILISATION 



[1839. 

intercrossing of distinct plants lies the key to the whole 
question. Hermann Muller has well remarked that this 
“omission was for several generations fatal to Sprengel’s 

work For both at the time and subsequently, botanists 

felt above all the weakness of his theory, and they set aside, 
along with his defective ideas, his rich store of patient and 
acute observations and his comprehensive and accurate inter- 
pretations.” It remained for my father to convince the world 
that the meaning hidden in the structure of flowers was to 
be found by seeking light in the same direction in which 
Sprengel, seventy years before, had laboured. Robert Brown 
was the connecting link between them ; for although, accord- 
ing to Dr. Gray, * Brown, in common with the rest of the 
world, looked on Sprengel’s ideas as fantastic, yet it was at 
his recommendation that my father in 1841 read Sprengel’s 
now celebrated ‘Secret of Nature Displayed.! The book 
impressed him as being “ full of truth,” although “ with some 
little nonsense.” It not only encouraged him in kindred 
speculation, but guided him in his work, for in 1844 he 
speaks of verifying Sprengel’s observations. It may be 
doubted whether Robert Brown ever planted a more fruitful 
seed than in putting such a book into such hands. 

A passage in the ‘Autobiography’ (vol. i. p. 90) shows 
how it was that my father was attracted to the subject of 
fertilisation: “During the summer of 1839, and I believe 
during the previous summer, I was led to attend to the 
cross-fertilisation of flowers by the aid of insects, from 
having come to the conclusion in my speculations on the 
origin of species, that crossing played an important part in 
keeping specific forms constant.” 

The original connection between the study of flowers and 
the problem of Evolution is curious, and could hardly have 
been predicted. Moreover, it was not a permanent bond.

As soon as the idea arose that the offspring of cross- 
fertilisation is, in the struggle for life, likely to conquer the 
seedlings of self-fertilised parentage, a far more vigorous 
belief in the potency of natural selection in moulding the 
structure of flowers is attained. A central idea is gained 
towards which experiment and observation may be directed. 

Dr. Gray has well remarked with regard to this central idea 
(‘Nature,’ June 4, 1874) : — “ The aphorism, 1 Nature abhors a 
vacuum,’ is a characteristic specimen of the science of the 
middle ages. The aphorism, ‘ Nature abhors close fertilisa- 
tion,’ and the demonstration of the principle, belong to our 
age and to Mr. Darwin. To have originated this, and also 
the principle of Natural Selection .... and to have applied 
these principles to the system of nature, in such a manner as 
to make, within a dozen years, a deeper impression upon 
natural history than has been made since Linnaeus, is ample 
title for one man’s fame.” 

The flowers of the Fapilionaceae attracted his attention 
early, and were the subject of his first paper on fertilisation.* 
The following extract from an undated letter to Dr. Asa 
Gray seems to have been written before the publication of 
this paper, probably in 1856 or 1857 : — 

“. . . . What you say on Papilionaceous flowers is very 
true ; and I have no facts to show that varieties are crossed ; 
but yet (and the same remark is applicable in a beautiful way 
to Fumaria and Dielytra, as I noticed many years ago), I 
must believe that the flowers are constructed partly in direct 
relation to the visits of insects ; and how insects can avoid 
bringing pollen from other individuals I cannot understand. 
It is really pretty to watch the action of a Humble-bee on 
the scarlet kidney bean, and in this genus (and in Lathyrus

FERTILISATION 



[1857- 

grandiflorus) the honey is so placed that the bee invariably 
alights on that one side of the flower towards which the spiral 
pistil is protruded (bringing out with it pollen), and by the 
depression of the wing-petal is forced against the bee’s side 
all dusted with pollen.* In the broom the pistil is rubbed on 
the centre of the back of the bee. I suspect there is some- 
thing to be made out about the Leguminosre, which will 
bring the case within our theory ; though I have failed to do 
so. Our theory will explain why in the vegetable and ani- 
mal kingdom the act of fertilisation even in hermaphrodites 
usually takes place sub-jove, though thus exposed to great 
injury from damp and rain. In animals which cannot 
be [fertilised] by insects or wind, there is no case of land- 
animals being hermaphrodite without the concourse of two 
individuals.” 

A letter to Dr. Asa Gray (Sept 5th, 1857) gives the sub- 
stance of the paper in the Gar denerd Chronicle : — 

“ Lately I was led to examine buds of kidney bean with 
the pollen shed ; but I was led to believe that the pollen could 
hardly get on the stigma by wind or otherwise, except by 
bees visiting [the flower] and moving the wing petals : hence 
I included a small bunch of flowers in two bottles in every 
way treated the same : the flowers in one I daily just 
momentarily moved, as if by a bee ; these set three line 
pods, the other not one. Of course this little experiment 
must be tried again, and this year in England it is too late, 
as the flowers seem now seldom to set. If bees are neces- 
sary to this flower’s self-fertilisation, bees must almost cross 
them, as their dusted right-side of head and right legs 
constantly touch the stigma. 

“ I have, also, lately been re-observing daily Lobelia fulgent 
— this in my garden is never visited by insects, and never sets

seeds, without pollen be put on the stigma (whereas the small 
blue Lobelia is visited by bees and does set seed) ; I mention 
this because there are such beautiful contrivances to prevent 
the stigma ever getting its own pollen ; which seems only 
explicable on the doctrine of the advantage of crosses.” 

The paper was supplemented by a second in 1858.* The 
chief object of these publications seems to have been to 
obtain information as to the possibility of growing varieties 
of leguminous plants near each other, and yet keeping 
them true. It is curious that the Papilionaceae should not 
only have been the first flowers which attracted his attention 
by their obvious adaptation to the visits of insects, but should 
also have constituted one of his sorest puzzles. The common 
pea and the sweet pea gave him much difficulty, because, 
although they are as obviously fitted for insect-visits as the 
rest of the order, yet their varieties keep true. The fact is 
that neither of these plants being indigenous, they are not 
perfectly adapted for fertilisation by British insects. He 
could not, at this stage of his observations, know that the 
co-ordination between a flower and the particular insect 
which fertilises it may be as delicate as that between a lock 
and its key, so that this explanation was not likely to occur 
to him.f 

Besides observing the Leguminosae, he had already begun, 
as shown in the foregoing extracts, to attend to the structure 
of other flowers in relation to insects. At the beginning of 
i860 he worked at Leschenaultia,t which at first puzzled him, 



* Gardeners' Chronicle , 1858, 
p. 828. In 1861 another paper on 
Fertilisation appeared in the Gar- 
deners’ Chronicle, p. 552, in which 
he explained the action of insects 
on Vinca major. He was attracted 
to the periwinkle by the fact that it 
is not visited by insects and never 



in the habits of insects. He pub- 
lished a short note in the Entomo- 
logists Weekly Intelligencer, i860, 
asking whether the Tineina and 
other small moths suck flowers. 

t He published a short paper on 
the manner of fertilisation of this 
flower, in the Gardener t Chronicle, 
1871, p. 1166. 



He was of course alive to variety

FERTILISATION 



[i860. 



but was ultimately made out. A passage in a letter chiefly 
relating to Leschenaultia seems to show that it was only in 
the spring of i860 that he began widely to apply his know- 
ledge to the relation of insects to other flowers. This is 
somewhat surprising, when we remember that he had read 
Sprengel many years before. He wrote (May 14) : — 

“I should look at this curious contrivance as specially 
related to visits of insects ; as I begin to think is almost 
universally the case.” 

Even in July 1862 he wrote to Dr. Asa Gray : — 

“There is no end to the adaptations. Ought not these 
cases to make one very cautious when one doubts about the 
use of all parts? I fully believe that the structure of all 
irregular flowers is governed in relation to insects. Insects 
are the Lords of the floral (to quote the witty Athenaum) 
world.” 

He was probably attracted to the study of Orchids by 
the fact that several kinds are common near Down. The 
letters of i860 show that these plants occupied a good deal of 
his attention ; and in 1861 he gave part of the summer, and 
all the autumn to the subject. He evidently considered 
himself idle for wasting time on Orchids which ought to 
have been given to ' Variation under Domestication.’ Thus 
he wrote : — 

“ There is to me incomparably more interest in observing 
than in writing ; but I feel quite guilty in trespassing on 
these subjects, and not sticking to varieties of the con- 
founded cocks, hens and ducks. I hear that Lyell is savage 
at me. I shall never resist Linum next summer.” 

It was in the summer of i860 that he made out one of the 
most striking and familiar facts in the book, namely, the 
manner in which the pollen masses in Orchis are adapted 
for removal by insects. He wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker 
July 12: — 

“ I have been examining Orchis fyramidalis, and it almost

equals, perhaps even beats, your Listera case; the sticky 
glands are congenitally united into a saddle-shaped organ, 
which has great power of movement, and seizes hold of 
a bristle (or proboscis) in an admirable manner, and then 
another movement takes place in the pollen masses, by 
which they are beautifully adapted to leave pollen on the 
two lateral stigmatic surfaces. I never saw anything so 
beautiful.” 

In June of the same year he wrote : — 

"You speak of adaptation being rarely visible, though 
present in plants. I have just recently been looking at the 
common Orchis, and I declare I think its adaptations in every 
part of the flower quite as beautiful and plain, or even more 
beautiful than in the Woodpecker. I have written and sent a 
notice for the Gardeners' Chronicle ,* on a curious difficulty in 
the Bee Orchis, and should much like to hear what you think 
of the case. In this article I have incidentally touched on 
adaptation to visits of insects ; but the contrivance to keep 
the sticky glands fresh and sticky beats almost everything in 
nature. I never remember having seen it described, but it 
must have been, and, as I ought not in my book to give 
the observation as my own, I should be very glad to know 
where this beautiful contrivance is described.” 

He wrote also to Dr. Gray, June 8, i860 : — 

"Talking of adaptation, I have lately been looking at our 
common orchids, and I dare say the facts are as old and well- 
known as the hills, but I have been so struck with admiration 
at the contrivances, that I have sent a notice to the Gardeners' 
Chronicle. The Ophrys apifera, offers, as you will see, a curious 
contradiction in structure.” 

Besides attending to the fertilisation of the flowers he was 
already, in i860, busy with the homologies of the parts, a

subject of which he made good use in the Orchid book 
He wrote to Sir Joseph Hooker (July): — 

“ It is a real good joke my discussing homologies of Orchids 
with you, after examining only three or four genera ; and this 
very fact makes me feel positive I am right ! ! I do not quite 
understand some of your terms ; but sometime I must get 
you to explain the homologies ; for I am intensely interested 
on the subject, just as at a game of chess." 

This work was valuable from a systematic point of view. 
In 1880 he wrote to Mr. Bentham : — 

"It was very kind in you to write to me about the 
Orchideae, for it has pleased me to an extreme degree that 1 
could have been of the least use to you about the nature of 
the parts.” 

The pleasure which his early observations on Orchids gave 
him is show in such extracts as the following from a letter 
to Sir J. D. Hooker (July 27, 1861) : — 

“You cannot conceive how the Orchids have delighted me. 
They came safe, but box rather smashed ; cylindrical old 
cocoa- or snuff-canister much safer. I enclose postage. As 
an account of the movement, I shall allude to what I suppose 
is Oncidium, to make certain, — is the enclosed flower with 
crumpled petals this genus ? Also I most specially want to 
know what the enclosed little globular brown Orchid is. I 
have only seen pollen of a Cattleya on a bee, but surely have 
you not unintentionally sent me what I wanted most (after 
Catasetum or Mormodes), viz. one of the Epidendreae?! I 
particularly want (and will presently tell you why) another 
spike of this little Orchid, with older flowers, some even 
almost withered.” 

His delight in observation is again shown in a letter to 
Dr. Gray (1863). Referring to Criiger’s letters from Trinidad, 
he wrote : — “ Happy man, he has actually seen crowds of 
bees flying round Catasetum, with the pollinia sticking to 
their backs !"

The following extracts of letters to Sir J. D. Hooker illus- 
trate further the interest which his work excited in him : — 
"Veitch sent me a grand lot this morning. What wonderful 
structures 1 

“ I have now seen enough, and you must not send me more, 
for though I enjoy looking at them much, and it has been 
very useful to me, seeing so many different forms, it is 
idleness. For my object each species requires studying for 
days. I wish you had time to take up the group. I would 
give a good deal to know what the rostellum is, of which I have 
traced so many curious modifications. I suppose it cannot be 
one of the stigmas,* there seems a great tendency for two 
lateral stigmas to appear. My paper, though touching on 
only subordinate points will run, I fear, to 100 MS. folio 
pages ! The beauty of the adaptation of parts seems to me 
unparalleled. I should think or guess waxy pollen was most 
differentiated. In Cypripedium which seems least modified, 
and a much exterminated group, the grains are single. In 
all others, as far as I have seen, they are in packets of four ; 
and these packets cohere into many wedge-formed masses in 
Orchis ; into eight, four, and finally two. It seems curious 
that a flower should exist, which could at most fertilise only 
two other flowers, seeing how abundant pollen generally is ; 
this fact I look at as explaining the perfection of the con- 
trivance by which the pollen, so important from its fewness, 
is carried from flower to flower” (1861). 

“ I was thinking of writing to you to-day, when your note 
with the Orchids came. What frightful trouble you have 
taken about Vanilla ; you really must not take an atom 
more ; for the Orchids are more play than real work. I have 
been much interested by Epidendrum, and have worked all 
morning at them ; for heaven’s sake, do not corrupt me by 
any more” (August 30, 1861).

FERTILISATION 



[1861. 



He originally intended to publish his notes on Orchids 
as a paper in the Linnean Society’s Journal, but it soon 
became evident that a separate volume would be a more 
suitable form of publication. In a letter to Sir J. D. Hooker, 
Sept. 24, 1861, he writes : — 

“ I have been acting, I fear that you will think, like a goose ; 
and perhaps in truth I have. When I finished a few days 
ago my Orchis paper, which turns out 140 folio pages ! ! and 
thought of the expense of woodcuts, I said to myself, I will 
offer the Linnean Society to withdraw it, and publish it in a 
pamphlet. It then flashed on me that perhaps Murray would 
publish it, so I gave him a cautious description, and offered 
to share risks and profits. This morning he writes that he 
will publish and take all risks, and share profits and pay for 
all illustrations. It is a risk, and heaven knows whether it 
will not be a dead failure, but I have not deceived Murray, 
and [have] told him that it would interest those alone who 
cared much for natural history. I hope I do not exaggerate 
the curiosity of the many special contrivances.” 

He wrote the two following letters to Mr. Murray about 
the publication of the book :] 

Down, Sept. 21 [1861]. 

My dear Sir, — Will you have the kindness to give me 
your opinion, which I shall implicitly follow. I have just 
finished a very long paper intended for Linnean Society 
(the title is enclosed), and yesterday for the first time it 
occurred to me that possibly it might be worth publishing 
separately, which would save me trouble and delay. The 
facts are new, and have been collected during twenty years 
and strike me as curious. Like a Bridgewater treatise, the 
chief object is to show the perfection of the many contrivances 
in Orchids. The subject of propagation is interesting to 
most people, and is treated in my paper so that any woman 
could read it. Parts are dry and purely scientific; but I

think my paper would interest a good many of such persons 
who care for Natural History, but no others. 

... It would be a very little book, and I believe you think 
very little books objectionable. I have myself great doubts 
on the subject I am very apt to think that my geese are 
swans ; but the subject seems to me curious and interesting. 

I beg you not to be guided in the least in order to oblige 
me, but as far as you can judge, please give me your opinion. 
If I were to publish separately, I would agree to any terms, 
such as half risk and half profit, or what you liked ; but I 
would not publish on my sole risk, for to be frank, I have 
been told that no publisher whatever, under such circum- 
stances, cares for the success of a book. 



C. Darwin to J. Murray. 

Down, Sept. 24 [1861]. 

My dear Sir, — I am very much obliged for your note and 
very liberal offer. I have had some qualms and fears. All 
that I can feel sure of is that the MS. contains many new and 
curious facts, and I am sure the Essay would have interested 
me, and will interest those who feel lively interest in the 
wonders of nature ; but how far the public will care for such 
minute details, I cannot at all tell. It is a bold experiment ; 
and at worst, cannot entail much loss ; as a certain amount 
of sale will, I think, be pretty certain. A large sale is out of 
the question. As far as I can judge, generally the points 
which interest me I find interest others; but I make the 
experiment with fear and trembling, — not for my own sake, 
but for yours. . . . 

[On Sept. 28th he wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker : — 

“What a good soul you are not to sneer at me, but to pat 
me on the back. I have the greatest doubt whether I am not 
going to do, in publishing my paper, a most ridiculous thing.

268 FERTILISATION [l86l. 

It would annoy me much, but only for Murray’s sake, if the 
publication were a dead failure.” 

There was still much work to be done, and in October he 
was still receiving Orchids from Kew, and wrote to Hooker:— 
“ It is impossible to thank you enough. I was almost mad 
at the wealth of Orchids.” And again — 

“Mr. Veitch most generously has sent me two splendid 
buds of Mormodes, which will be capital for dissection, but 
I fear will never be irritable; so for the sake of charity 
and love of heaven do, I beseech you, observe what move- 
ment takes place in Cychnoches, and what part must be 
touched. Mr. V. has also sent me one splendid flower of 
Catasetum, the most wonderful Orchid I have seen.” 

On Oct 13th he wrote to Sir Joseph Hooker : — 

“It seems that I cannot exhaust your good nature I 
have had the hardest day’s work at Catasetum and buds of 
Mormodes, and believe I understand at last the mechanism of 
movements and the functions. Catasetum is a beautiful case 
of slight modification of structure leading to new functions. I 
never was more interested in any subject in my life than in 
this of Orchids. I owe very much to you.” 

Again to the same friend, Nov. I, 1861 : — 

“ If you really can spare another Catasetum, when nearly 
ready, I shall be most grateful ; had I not better send for it? 
The case is truly marvellous ; the (so-called) sensation, or 
stimulus from a light touch is certainly transmitted through 
the antennae for more than one inch instantaneously. ... A 
cursed insect or something let my last flower off last night” 
Professor de Candolle has remarked* of my father, “Ce 
n’est pas lui qui aurait demand^ de construire des palais 
pour y loger des laboratoires.” This was singularly true of 
his orchid work, or rather it would be nearer the truth to say 
that he had no laboratory, for it was only after the publication

of the ' Fertilisation of Orchids,’ that he built himself a green- 
house. He wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker (Dec. 24th, 1862) : — 

“ And now I am going to tell you a most important piece 
of news ! ! I have almost resolved to build a small hot-house ; 
my neighbour’s really first-rate gardener has suggested it, 
and offered to make me plans, and see that it is well done, 
and he is really a clever fellow, who wins lots of prizes, and 
is very observant He believes that we should succeed with 
a little patience ; it will be a grand amusement for me to 
experiment with plants.” 

Again he wrote (Feb. 15 th, 1863) : — 

“I write now because the new hot-house is ready, and I 
long to stock it, just like a schoolboy. Could you tell me 
pretty soon what plants you can give me ; and then I shall 
know what to order? And do advise me how I had better 
get such plants as you can spare. Would it do to send my 
tax-cart early in the morning, on a day that was not frosty, 
lining the cart with mats, and arriving here before night ? 
I have no idea whether this degree of exposure (and of course 
the cart would be cold) could injure stove-plants ; they would 
be about five hours (with bait) on the journey home.” 

A week later he wrote : — 

“You cannot imagine what pleasure your plants give 
me (far more than your dead Wedgwood ware can give you) ; 
H. and I go and gloat over them, but we privately confessed 
to each other, that if they were not our own, perhaps we 
should not see such transcendent beauty in each leaf.” 

And in March, when he was extremely unwell he wrote : — 
“ A few words about the Stove-plants ; they do so amuse 
me. I have crawled to see them two or three times. Will 
you correct and answer, and return enclosed. I have hunted 
in all my books and cannot find these names,* and I like 
much to know the family.” 

* His difficulty with regard to with regard to a Lupine on which 
the names of plants is illustrated, he was at work, in an extract from

270 FERTILISATION [1862. 

The book was published May 15th, 1862. Of its reception 
he writes to Mr. Murray, June 13th and 18th : — 

“ The Botanists praise my Orchid-book to the skies. Some 
one sent me (perhaps you) the ‘ Parthenon,’ with a good review. 
The Athenceum * treats me with very kind pity and contempt ; 
but the reviewer knew nothing of his subject.” 

“ There is a superb, but I fear exaggerated, review in the 
‘ London Review.’ f But I have not been a fool, as I thought 
I was, to publish ; t for Asa Gray, about the most competent 
judge in the world, thinks almost as highly of the book as 
does the ‘London Review.’ The AtheiuBum will hinder the 
sale greatly.” 

The Rev. M. J. Berkeley was the author of the notice 
in the * London Review,’ as my father learned from Sir J. 
D. Hooker, who added, “ I thought it very well done indeed 
I have read a good deal of the Orchid-book, and echo all 
he says.” 

To this my father replied (June 30th, 1862): — 

“ My dear Old Friend, — You speak of my warming the 
cockles of your heart, but you will never know how often you 
have warmed mine. It is not your approbation of my scien- 
tific work (though I care for that more than for any one’s) : it 
is something deeper. To this day I remember keenly a letter 
you wrote to me from Oxford, when I was at the Water-cure, 
and how it cheered me when I was utterly weary of life. 



a letter (July si, 1866) to Sir J. D. 
Hooker : “ I sent to the nursery 
garden, whence I bought the seed, 
and could only hear that it was 
* the common blue Lupine,’ the man 
saying ‘he was no scholard, and 
did not know Latin, and that parties 
who make experiments ought to 
find out the names.’ ” 

* May 24, 1862. 
t June 14, 1862. 



t Doubts on this point still, how- 
ever, occurred to him about this 
time. He wrote to Prof. Oliver 
(June 8) : “ I am glad that you have 
read my Orchis-book and seem to 
approve of it ; for I never published 
anything which I so much doubted 
whether it was worth publishing, 
and indeed I still doubt. The sub- 
ject interested me beyond what, I 
suppose, it is worth.”

271 



Well, my Orchis-book is a success (but I do not know 
whether it sells).” 

In another letter to the same friend, he wrote : — 

"You have pleased me much by what you say in regard to 
Bcntham and Oliver approving of my book ; for I had got a 
sort of nervousness, and doubted whether I had not made an 
egregious fool of myself, and concocted pleasant little stinging 
remarks for reviews, such as ‘ Mr. Darwin’s head seems to have 
been turned by a certain degree of success, and he thinks that 
the most trifling observations are worth publication.’ ” 

Mr. Bentham’s approval was given in his Presidential 
Address to the Linnean Society, May 24, 1862, and was 
all the more valuable, because it came from one who was 
by no means supposed to be favourable to Evolutionary 
doctrines.] 



C. Darwin to Asa Gray. 

Down, June 10 [1862]. 

My DEAR Gray, — Your generous sympathy makes you over- 
estimate what you have read of my Orchid-book. But your 
letter of May 18th and 26th has given me an almost foolish 
amount of satisfaction. The subject interested me, I knew, 
beyond its real value ; but I had lately got to think that I had 
made myself a complete fool by publishing in a semi-popular 
form. Now I shall confidently defy the world. I have heard 
that Bentham and Oliver approve of it ; but I have heard the 
opinion of no one else whose opinion is worth a farthing. . . . 
No doubt my volume contains much error : how curiously 
difficult it is to be accurate, though I try my utmost. Your 
notes have interested me beyond measure. I can now afford 
to d— my critics with ineffable complacency of mind. Cordial 
thanks for this benefit It is surprising to me that you should 
have strength of mind to care for science, amidst the awful 
events daily occurring in your country. I daily look at the 
Times with almost as much interest as an American could do.

When will peace come ? it is dreadful to think of the desola-

[Dr. Asa Gray reviewed the book in ‘ Silliman’s Journal,’* 
where he speaks, in strong terms, of the fascination which 
it must have for even slightly instructed readers. He made, 
too, some original observations on an American orchid, and 
these first-fruits of the subject, sent in MS. or proof sheet 
to my father, were welcomed by him in a letter (J uly 23rd) 
“Last night, after writing the above, I read the great

My DEAR Gray, — I hardly know what to thank for first 
Your stamps gave infinite satisfaction. I took him f first one 
lot, and then an hour afterwards another lot H e actually raised 
himself on one elbow to look at them. It was the first animation 
he showed. He said only : “ You must thank Professor Gray 
awfully.” In the evening after a long silence, there came out 
the oracular sentence : “ He is awfully kind.” And indeed you 
are, overworked as you are, to take so much trouble for our

poor dear little man. — And now I must begin the “ awfullys ” 
on my own account : what a capital notice you have published 
on the Orchids I It could not have been better ; but I fear that 
you overrate it I am very sure that I had not the least 
idea that you or any one would approve of it so much. I 
return your last note for the chance of your publishing any 
notice on the subject; but after all perhaps you may not 
think it worth while ; yet in my judgment several of your 
facts, especially Platanthera hyperborea , are much too good 
to be merged in a review. But I have always noticed that 
you are prodigal in originality in your reviews. . . . 

[Sir Joseph Hooker reviewed the book in the Gardeners' 
Chronicle, writing in a successful imitation of the style of 
Lindley, the Editor. My father wrote to Sir Joseph (Nov. 12, 
1862) : — 

“So you did write the review in the Gardeners' Chronicle. 
Once or twice I doubted whether it was Lindley ; but when 
I came to a little slap at R. Brown, I doubted no longer. 
You arch-rogue ! I do not wonder you have deceived others 
also. Perhaps I am a conceited dog; but if so, you have 
much to answer for; I never received so much praise, and 
coming from you I value it much more than from any other.” 

With regard to botanical opinion generally, he wrote to 
Dr. Gray, “ I am fairly astonished at the success of my book 
with botanists.” Among naturalists who were not botanists, 
Lyell was pre-eminent in his appreciation of the book. I have 
no means of knowing when he read it, but in later life, as 
I learn from Professor Judd, he was enthusiastic in praise of 
the 1 Fertilisation of Orchids,’ which he considered “ next to 
the ‘Origin,’ as the most valuable of all Darwin’s works.” 
Among the general public the author did not at first hear 
of many disciples, thus he wrote to his cousin Fox, in 
September 1862 : “ Hardly any one not a botapisf^^pept; 
yourself, as far as I know, has cared for it." >

FERTILISATION 



[1862. 



A favourable notice appeared in the Saturday Review, 
October 1 8th, 1 862 ; the reviewer points out that the book would 
escape the angry polemics aroused by the ‘ Origin.’ * This is 
illustrated by a review in the Literary Churchman, in which 
only one fault is found, namely, that Mr. Darwin’s expression 
of admiration at the contrivances in orchids is too indirect a 
way of saying, “ O Lord, how manifold are Thy works I ’’ 

A somewhat similar criticism occurs in the ‘Edinburgh 
Review ’ (October 1 862). The writer points out that Mr. Darwin 
constantly uses phrases, such as “beautiful contrivance,” “the 
labellum is . . . in order to attract,” “ the nectar is purposely 
lodged." The Reviewer concludes his discussion thus: “We 
know, too, that these purposes and ideas are not our own, 
but the ideas and purposes of Another.” 

The ‘ Edinburgh ’ reviewer’s treatment of his subject was 
criticised in the Saturday Review, November 15th, 1862. With 
reference to this article my father wrote to Sir Joseph Hooker 
(December 29th, 1862) : — 

“ Here is an odd chance ; my nephew Henry Parker, an 
Oxford Classic, and Fellow of Oriel, came here this evening; 
and I asked him whether he knew who had written the little 
article in the Saturday, smashing the [Edinburgh reviewer], 
which we liked ; and after a little hesitation he owned he 
had. I never knew that he wrote in the Saturday ; and was 
it not an odd chance ?” 

The ‘ Edinburgh ’ article was written by the Duke of 
Argyll, and has since been made use of in his * Reign of Law,’ 
1867. Mr. Wallace replied f to the Duke’s criticisms, making 
some especially good remarks on those which refer to orchids. 
He shows how, by a “ beautiful self-acting adjustment,” the 
nectary of the orchid Angraecum (from 10 to 14 inches in 

* Dr. Gray pointed out that if matised by the natural theologians, 
the Orchid-book (with a few trifling t * Quarterly Journal of Science,' 
omissions) had appeared before the October 1867. Republished in

length), and the proboscis of a moth sufficiently long to reach 
the nectar, might be developed by natural selection. He goes 
on to point out that on any other theory we must suppose 
that the flower was created with an enormously long nectary, 
and that then by a special act, an insect was created fitted to 
visit the flower, which would otherwise remain sterile. With re- 
gard to this point my father wrote (October 12 or 13, 1867) : — 

“ I forgot to remark how capitally you turn the tables on 
the Duke, when you make him create the Angraecum and 
Moth by special creation.” 

If we examine the literature relating to the fertilisation of 
flowers, we do not find that this new branch of study showed 
any great activity immediately after the publication of the 
Orchid-book. There are a few papers by Asa Gray, in 1862 
and 1863, by Hildebrand in 1864, and by Moggridge in 1865, 
but the great mass of work by Axell, Delpino, Hildebrand, 
and the Mullers, did not begin to appear until about 1867. 
The period during which the new views were being assimi- 
lated, and before they became thoroughly fruitful, was, how- 
ever, surprisingly short. The later activity in this depart- 
ment may be roughly gauged by the fact that the valuable 
'Bibliography,’ given by Prof. D’Arcy Thompson in his 
translation of Muller’s * Befruchtung ’ (1883), contains refer- 
ences to 814 papers. 

Besides the book on Orchids, my father wrote two or three 
papers on the subject, which will be found mentioned in the 
Appendix. The earliest of these, on the three sexual forms 
of Catasetum, was published in 1862 ; it is an anticipation 
of part of the Orchid-book, and was merely published in the 
Linncan Society’s Journal, in acknowledgment of the use 
made of a specimen in the Society’s possession. The possi- 
bility of apparently distinct species being merely sexual forms 
of a single species, suggested a characteristic experiment, 
which is alluded to in the following letter to one of his earliest 
disciples in the study of the fertilisation of flowers :]

FERTILISATION 



[1865. 



C. Darwin to J. Traherne Moggridge .* 

Down, October 13 [1865J. 

My DEAR Sir, — I am especially obliged to you for your 
beautiful plates and letter-press ; for no single point in natural 
history interests and perplexes me so much as the self-fertili- 
sation t of the Bee-orchis. You have already thrown some 
light on the subject, and your present observations promise 
to throw more. 

I formed two conjectures : first, that some insect during 
certain seasons might cross the plants, but I have almost 
given up this ; nevertheless, pray have a look at the flowers 
next season. Secondly, I conjectured that the Spider and 
Bee-orchids might be a crossing and self-fertile form of the 
same species. Accordingly I wrote some years ago to an 
acquaintance, asking him to mark some Spider-orchids, and 
observe whether they retained the same character ; but he 
evidently thought the request as foolish as if I had asked him 
to mark one of his cows with a ribbon, to see if it would turn 
next spring into a horse. Now will you be so kind as to tie 
a string round the stem of half-a-dozen Spider-orchids, and 
when you leave Mentone dig them up, and I would try and 
cultivate them and see if they kept constant ; but I should re- 
quire to know in what sort of soil and situations they grow. It 
would be indispensable to mark the plant so that there could be 
no mistake about the individual. It is also just possible that 
the same plant would throw up, at different seasons different 
flower-scapes, and the marked plants would serve as evidence. 

With many thanks, my dear sir, 

Yours sincerely, 

Ch. Darwin.

of * Harvesting Ants and Trap-door 
Spiders,’ ‘ Flora of Mentone,’ &c. 

f He once remarked to Dr. Nor- 
man Moore that one of the things 
that made him wish to live a few 



thousand years, was his desire to 
see the extinction of the Bee- 
orchis, — an end to which he be- 
lieved its self-fertilising habit ms

P.S.— I send by this post my paper on climbing plants, parts 
of which you might like to read. 

[Sir Thomas Farrer and Dr. W. Ogle were also guided and 
encouraged by my father in their observations. The following 
refers to a paper by Sir Thomas Farrer, in the ‘Annals and 
Magazine of Natural History,’ 1868, on the fertilisation of 
the Scarlet Runner :] 



C. Darwin to T. H. Farrer. 

Down, Sept 15, 1868. 

My dear Mr. Farrer, — I grieve to say that the main 
features of your case are known. I am the sinner and de- 
scribed them some ten years ago. But I overlooked many 
details, as the appendage to the single stamen, and several 
other points. I send my notes, but I must beg for their 
return, as I have no other copy. I quite agree, the facts are 
most striking, especially as you put them. Are you sure that 
the Hive-bee is the cutter t it is against my experience. 
If sure, make the point more prominent, or if not sure, erase 
it I do not think the subject is quite new enough for the 
Linnean Society ; but I dare say the * Annals and Magazine 
of Natural History,’ or Gardeners' Chronicle would gladly 
publish your observations, and it is a great pity they should 
be lost If you like I would send your paper to either 
quarter with a note. In this case you must give a title, 
and your name, and perhaps it would be well to premise 
your remarks with a line of reference to my paper stating 
that you had observed independently and more fully. 

I have read my own paper over after an interval of several 
years, and am amused at the caution with which I put the 
case that the final end was for crossing distinct individuals, of 
which I was then as fully convinced as now, but I knew that 
the doctrine would shock all botanists. Now the opinion is 
becoming familiar.

FERTILISATION 



[1868. 



To see penetration of pollen-tubes is not difficult, but in 
most cases requires some practice with dissecting under a 
one-tenth of an inch focal distance single lens ; and just at 
first this will seem to you extremely difficult. 

What a capital observer you are — a first-rate Naturalist 
has been sacrificed, or partly sacrificed, to Public life. 

Believe me, yours very sincerely, 

Ch. Darwin. 

P.S. — If you come across any large Salvia, look at it— the 
contrivance is admirable. It went to my heart to tell a man 
who came here a few weeks ago with splendid drawings and 
MS. on Salvia, that the work had been all done in Germany.* 

[The following extract is from a letter, November 26th, 1868, 
to Sir Thomas Farrer, written as I learn from him, “ in answer 
to a request for some advice as to the best modes of ob- 
servation.” 

“ In my opinion the best plan is to go on working and 
making copious notes, without much thought of publication, 
and then if the results turn out striking publish them. It 
is my impression, but I do not feel sure that I am right, 
that the best and most novel plan would be, instead of de- 
scribing the means of fertilisation in particular plants, to 
investigate the part which certain structures play with all 
plants or throughout certain orders ; for instance, the brush 
of hairs on the style, or the diadelphous condition of the 
stamens in the Leguminosse, or the hairs within the corolla, 
&c. &c. Looking to your note, I think that this is perhaps 
the plan which you suggest. 

It is well to remember that Naturalists value observations 

* Dr. W. Ogle, the observer of gratefully to his relationship with 
the fertilisation of Salvia here my father in the introduction to 
alluded to, published his results in his translation of Kcrner's 1 Flowers

He refers both gracefully and

fir more than reasoning ; therefore your conclusions should 
be as often as possible fortified by noticing how insects actu- 
ally do the work.” 

In 1869, Sir Thomas Farrer corresponded with my father 
on the fertilisation of Passiflora and of Tacsonia. He has 
given me his impressions of the correspondence : — 

" I had suggested that the elaborate series of chevaux-de- 
frise, by which the nectary of the common Passiflora is 
guarded, were specially calculated to protect the flower from 
the stiff-beaked humming birds which would not fertilize it, 
and to facilitate the access of the little proboscis of the 
humble bee, which would do so ; whilst, on the other hand, the 
long pendent tube and flexible valve-like corona which retains 
the nectar of Tacsonia would shut out the bee, which would 
not, and admit the humming bird which would, fertilize that 
(lower. The suggestion is very possibly worthless, and could 
only be verified or refuted by examination of flowers in the 
countries where they grow naturally. . . . What interested 
me was to see that on this as on almost any other point of 
detailed observation, Mr. Darwin could always say, ‘Yes; 
but at one time I made some observations myself on this 
particular point ; and I think you will find, &c. &c.’ That 
he should after years of interval remember that he had 
noticed the peculiar structure to which I was referring in the 
Passiflora princeps struck me at the time as very remark- 
able.” 

With regard to the spread of a belief in the adaptation of 
(lowers for cross -fertilisation, my father wrote to Mr. Bentham 
April 22, 1868 : — • 

“ Most of the criticisms which I sometimes meet with in 
French works against the frequency of crossing, I am certain 
are the result of mere ignorance. I have never hitherto 
found the rule to fail that when an author describes the 
structure of a flower as specially adapted for self-fertilisation, 
it is really adapted for crossing. The Fumariaceae offer a

good instance of this, and Treviranus threw this order in my 
teeth ; but in Corydalis, Hildebrand shows how utterly false 
the idea of self-fertilisation is. This author’s paper on Salvia 
is really worth reading, and I have observed some species, 
and know that he is accurate." 

The next letter refers to Professor Hildebrand’s paper on 
Corydalis, published in the ‘Proc. Internat. Hort. Congress,’ 
London, 1866, and in Pringsheim’s ‘ Jahrbiicher,’ vol. v. The 
memoir on Salvia alluded to is contained in the previous 
volume of the same Journal :] 



C. Darwin to F. Hildebrand.* 

Down, May 16 [1866]. 

My DEAR Sir, — T he state of my health prevents my attend- 
ing the Hort. Congress ; but I forwarded yesterday your paper 
to the secretary, and if they are not overwhelmed with papers, 
yours will be gladly received. I have made many observa- 
tions on the Fumariaceae, and convinced myself that they were 
adapted for insect agency ; but I never observed anything 
nearly so curious as your most interesting facts. I hope you 
will repeat your experiments on the Corydalis on a larger 
scale, and especially on several distinct plants ; for your 
plant might have been individually peculiar, like certain indi- 
vidual plants of Lobelia, 8rc., described by Gartner, and of 
Passiflora and Orchids described by Mr. Scott. . . . 

Since writing to you before, I have read your admirable 
memoir on Salvia, and it has interested me almost as much as 
when I first investigated the structure of Orchids. Your 
paper illustrates several points in my ‘Origin of Species,’ 
especially the transition of organs. Knowing only two or 
three species in the genus, I had often marvelled how one 
cell of the anther could have been transformed into the mov- 
able plate or spoon ; and how well you show the gradations ;

but I am surprised that you did not more strongly insist on 
this point 

I shall be still more surprised if you do not ultimately 
come to the same belief with me, as shown by so many beau- 
tiful contrivances, that all plants require, from some unknown 
cause, to be occasionally fertilized by pollen from a distinct 
individual. With sincere respect, believe me, my dear Sir, 
Yours very faithfully, 

Ch. Darwin. 

[The following letter refers to the late Hermann Muller’s 
‘Befruchtung der Blumen,’ by far the most valuable of the 
mass of literature originating in the ‘ Fertilisation of Orchids.’ 
An English translation, by Prof. D’Arcy Thompson was pub-

is dated February 6, 1882, and is therefore almost the last of 
his writings :] 



C. Darwin to H. Muller. 

Down, May 5, 1873. 

My DEAR Sir, — Owing to all sorts of interruptions and to 
my reading German so slowly, I have read only to p. 88 of 
your book ; but I must have the pleasure of telling you how 
very valuable a work it appears to me. Independently of the 
many original observations, which of course form the most 
important part, the work will be of the highest use as a means 
of reference to all that has been done on the subject I am 
fairly astonished at the number of species of insects, the visits 
of which to different flowers you have recorded. You must 
have worked in the most indefatigable manner. About half a 
year ago the editor of 1 Nature’ suggested that it would be a 
grand undertaking if a number of naturalists were to do what 
you have already done on so large a scale with respect to the 
visits of insects. I have been particularly glad to read your 
historical sketch, for I had never before seen all the references

put together. I have sometimes feared that I was in error 
when I said that C. K. Sprengel did not fully perceive that 
cross-fertilisation was the final end of the structure of flowers ; 
but now this fear is relieved, and it is a great satisfaction to 
me to believe that I have aided in making his excellent book 
more generally known. Nothing has surprised me more 
than to see in your historical sketch how much I myself have 
done on the subject, as it never before occurred to me to 
think of all my papers as a whole. But I do not doubt that 
your generous appreciation of the labours of others has led 
you to over-estimate what I have done. With very sincere 
thanks and respect, believe me, 

Yours faithfully, 

Charles Darwin. 

P.S. — I have mentioned your book to almost every one 
who, as far as I know, cares for the subject in England ; and 
I have ordered a copy to be sent to our Royal Society.

I heartily agree with you in your high appreciation of poor 
old C. Sprengel’s work ; and one regrets bitterly that he did 
not live to see his labours thus valued. It rejoices me also 
to notice how highly you appreciate H. Muller, who has 
always seemed to me an admirable observer and reasoner. 
I am at present endeavouring to persuade an English

My DEAR Gray, — I was rejoiced to see your handwriting 
again in your note of the 4th, of which more anon. I was 
astonished to see announced about a week ago that you were 
going to write in ‘ Nature ’ an article on me, and this morning 
I received an advance copy. It is the grandest thing ever 
written about me, especially as coming from a man like 
yourself. It has deeply pleased me, particularly some of 
your side remarks. It is a wonderful thing to me to live to 
see my name coupled in any fashion with that of Robert 
Brown. But you are a bold man, for I am sure that you 
will be sneered at by not a few botanists. I have never been 
so honoured before, and I hope it will do me good and make 
me try to be as careful as possible ; and good heavens, how 
difficult accuracy is ! I feel a very proud man, but I hope 
this won’t last. . . .

C. Darwin to H. MilUer. 

Down, August 7, 1876. 

.... I was much interested by your brother's article on 
Hedychium ; about two years ago I was so convinced that 
the flowers were fertilized by the tips of the wings of large 
moths, that I wrote to India to ask a man to observe the 
flowers and catch the moths at work, and he sent me 20 to 
30 Sphinx-moths, but so badly packed that they all arrived in 
fragments ; and I could make out nothing. . . . 

Yours sincerely, 

Ch. Darwin. 

[The following extract from a letter (Feb. 25, 1864), to 
Dr. Gray refers to another prediction fulfilled : — 

“ I have of course seen no one, and except good dear 
Hooker, I hear from no one. He, like a good and true friend, 
though so overworked, often writes to me. 

“ I have had one letter which has interested me greatly, 
with a paper, which will appear in the Linnean Journal, by 
Dr. Criiger of Trinidad, which shows that I am all right about 
Catasetum, even to the spot where the pollinia adhere to the 
bees, which visit the flower, as I said, to gnaw the labellum. 
Criiger’s account of Coryanthes and the use of the bucket-like 
labellum full of water beats everything : I suspect that the 
bees being well wetted flattens their hairs, and allows the 
viscid disc to adhere.”]

affect me very little, and I can say with entire truth that your 
kind expression of sympathy has given and will give me 
much more pleasure than the election itself, should I be 
elected. 

Your idea that dicotyledonous plants were not developed 
in force until sucking insects had been evolved seems to me a 
splendid one. I am surprised that the idea never occurred 
to me, but, this is always the case when one first hears a new 
and simple explanation of some mysterious phenomenon .... 

I formerly showed that we might fairly assume that the 
beauty of flowers, their sweet odour and copious nectar, may 
be attributed to the existence of flower-haunting insects, but 
your idea, which I hope you will publish, goes much further 
and is much more important With respect to the great 
development of mammifers in the later Geological periods 
following from the development of dicotyledons, I think it 
ought to be proved that such animals as deer, cows, horses, 
&c. could not flourish if fed exclusively on the gramineae and 
other anemophilous monocotyledons ; and I do not suppose 
that any evidence on this head exists. 

Your suggestion of studying the manner of fertilisation of 
the surviving members of the most ancient forms of the 
dicotyledons is a very good one, and I hope that you will 
keep it in mind yourself, for I have turned my attention to 
other subjects. Delpino I think says that Magnolia is fertil- 
ised by insects which gnaw the petals, and I should not be 
surprised if the same fact holds good with Nymphma. 
Whenever I have looked at the flowers of these latter plants 
I have felt inclined to admit the view that petals are modified 
stamens, and not modified leaves ; though Poinsettia seems 
to show that true leaves might be converted into coloured 
petals. I grieve to say that I have never been properly 
grounded in Botany and have studied only special points — 
therefore I cannot pretend to express any opinion on your 
remarks on the origin of the flowers of the Conifer®, Gneta-

ceae, &c ; but I have been delighted with what you say on the 
conversion of a monoecious species into a hermaphrodite one 
by the condensations of the verticils on a branch bearing 
female flowers near the summit, and male flowers below. 

I expect Hooker to come here before long, and I will then 
show him your drawing, and if he makes any important re- 
marks I will communicate with you. He is very busy at 
present in clearing off arrears after his American Expedition, 
so that I do not like to trouble him, even with the briefest 
note. I am at present working with my son at some Physio- 
logical subjects, and we are arriving at very curious results, 
but they are not as yet sufficiently certain to be worth com- 
municating to you. . . . 

[In 1 877 a second edition of the * Fertilisation of Orchids’ was 
published, the first edition having been for some time out of 
print. The new edition was remodelled and almost rewritten, 
and a large amount of new matter added, much of which the 
author owed to his friend Fritz Muller. 

With regard to this edition he wrote to Dr. Gray : — 

“I do not suppose I shall ever again touch the book. 
After much doubt I have resolved to act in this way with all 
my books for the future ; that is to correct them once and 
never touch them again, so as to use the small quantity of 
work left in me for new matter.” 

He may have felt a diminution of his power of reviewing 
large bodies of facts, such as would be needed in the prepa- 
ration of new editions, but his powers of observation were 
certainly not diminished. He wrote to Mr. Dyer on July 14, 
1878 :-] 

My dear Dyer, — Thalia dealbata was sent me from Kew:

Pistil vigorously motile (so that whole flower shakes when 
pistil suddenly coils up) ; when excited by a touch the two 
filaments [are] produced laterally and transversely across the 
flower. (just over the nectar) from one of the petals or modi- 
fied stamens. It is splendid to watch the phenomenon under 
a weak power when a bristle is inserted into a young flower 
which no insect has visited. As far as I know Stylidium is the 
sole case of sensitive pistil and here it is the pistil -fstamens. 
In Thalia* cross-fertilisation is ensured by the wonderful 
movement, if bees visit several flowers. 

I have now relieved my mind and will tell the purport of 
this note— viz. if any other species of Thalia besides T. deal- 
bata should flower with you, for the love of heaven and all 
the saints, send me a few in tin box with damp moss.

words of approval :]

even than I anticipated. The translation seems to me as 
clear as daylight, and written in forcible and good familiar 
English. I am rather afraid that it is too good for the 
English public, which seems to like very washy food, unless 
it be administered by some one whose name is well known, 
and then I suspect a good deal of the unintelligible is very 
pleasing to them. I hope to heaven that I may be wrong.

for Botanical Science. 

Yours very sincerely, 

Ch. Darwin. 

P.S. — You have done me much honour in your prefatory 
remarks. 

[One of the latest references to his Orchid-work occurs in 
a letter to Mr. Bentham, February 16, 1880. It shows the 
amount of pleasure which this subject gave to my father, and 
(what is characteristic of him) that his reminiscence of the 
work was one of delight in the observations which preceded 
its publication, not to the applause which followed it : — 

“ They are wonderful creatures, these Orchids, and I some- 
times think with a glow of pleasure, when I remember making 
out some little point in their method of fertilisation.”]

CHAPTER VIII. 

THE ‘EFFECTS OF CROSS- AND SELF-FERTILISATION 
IN THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM.’ 1 876. 

[This book, as pointed out in the ‘Autobiography,’ is a 
complement to the ‘ Fertilisation of Orchids,’ because it shows 
how important are the results of cross-fertilisation which are 
ensured by the mechanisms described in that book. By 
proving that the offspring of cross-fertilisation are more 
vigorous than the offspring of self-fertilisation, he showed that 
one circumstance which influences the fate of young plants in 
the struggle for life is the degree to which their parents are 
fitted for cross-fertilisation. He thus convinced himself that 
the intensity of the struggle (which he had elsewhere shown 
to exist among young plants) is a measure of the strength 
of a selective agency perpetually sifting out every modification 
in the structure of flowers which can affect its capabilities 
for cross-fertilisation. 

The book is also valuable in another respect, because it 
throws light on the difficult problems of the origin of sexuality. 
The increased vigour resulting from cross-fertilisation is allied 
in the closest manner to the advantage gained by change 
of conditions. So strongly is this the case, that in some 
instances cross-fertilisation gives no advantage to the off- 
spring, unless the parents have lived under slightly different 
conditions. So that the really important thing is not that two 
individuals of different blood shall unite, but two individuals

which have been subjected to different conditions. We are 
thus led to believe that sexuality is a means for infusing 
vigour into the offspring by the coalescence of differentiated 
elements, an advantage which could not follow if reproductions 
were entirely asexual. 

It is remarkable that this book, the result of eleven years 
of experimental work, owed its origin to a chance observation. 
My father had raised two beds of Linaria vulgaris— one set 
being the offspring of cross- and the other of self-fertilisation. 
These plants were grown for the sake of some observations 
on inheritance, and not with any view to cross-breeding, and he 
was astonished to observe that the offspring of self-fertilisa- 
tion were clearly less vigorous than the others. It seemed 
incredible to him that this result could be due to a single act 
of self-fertilisation, and it was only in the following year, 
when precisely the same result occurred in the case of a 
similar experiment on inheritance in Carnations, that his 
attention was “ thoroughly aroused,” and that he determined 
to make a series of experiments specially directed to the 
question. The following letters give some account of the 
work in question :] 



C. Darwin to Asa Gray. 

September to, [1866!] 

.... I have just begun a large course of experiments on 
the germination of the seed, and on the growth of the young 
plants when raised from a pistil fertilised by pollen from the 
same flower, and from pollen from a distinct plant of the 
same, or of some other variety. I have not made sufficient 
experiments to judge certainly, but in some cases the differ- 
ence in the growth of the young plants is highly remarkable. 
I have taken every kind of precaution in getting seed from the 
same plant, in germinating the seed on my own chimney- 
piece, in planting the seedlings in the same flower-pot, and 
under this similar treatment I have seen the young seedlings

from the crossed seed exactly twice as tall as the seedlings 
from the self-fertilised seed ; both seeds having germinated 
on same day. If I can establish this fact (but perhaps it will 
all go to the dogs), in some fifty cases, with plants of different 
orders, I think it will be very important, for then we shall 
positively know why the structure of every flower permits, or 
favours, or necessitates an occasional cross with a distinct 
individual. But all this is rather cooking my hare before I 
have caught it. But somehow it is a great pleasure to me to 
tell you what I am about 

Believe me, my dear Gray, 

Ever yours most truly, and with cordial thanks, 

Ch. Darwin. 



C. Darwin to G. Bentham. 

April 22, 1868. 

.... I am experimenting on a very large scale on the 
difference in power of growth between plants raised from 
self-fertilised and crossed seeds ; and it is no exaggeration to 
say that the difference in growth and vigour is sometimes 
truly wonderful. Lyell, Huxley and Hooker have seen 
some of my plants, and been astonished ; and I should much 
like to show them to you. I always supposed until lately 
that no evil effects would be visible until after several genera- 
tions of self-fertilisation ; but now I see that one generation 
sometimes suffices ; and the existence of dimorphic plants 
and all the wonderful contrivances of orchids are quite 
intelligible to me. 

With cordial thanks for your letter, which has pleased me 
greatly, 

Yours very sincerely, 

Charles Darwin.

My dear Sir, — I have just received proofs in sheet of

will have to be struck off. I do not know what to advise. 
The greater part of the book is extremely dry, and the whole 
on a special subject Nevertheless, I am convinced that the 
book is of value, and I am convinced that for many years 
copies will be occasionally sold. Judging from the sale of 
my former books, and from supposing that some persons will 
purchase it to complete the set of my works, I would suggest 
1 500. But you must be guided by your larger experience 
I will only repeat that I am convinced the book is of some 
permanent value. . . .

My dear Sir,— I sent by this morning’s post the four 
first perfect sheets of my new book, the title of which you 
will see on the first page, and which will be published early 
in November. 

I am sorry to say that it is only shorter by a few pages 
than my * Insectivorous Plants.’ The whole is now in type, 
though I have corrected finally only half the volume. You 
will, therefore, rapidly receive the remainder. The book is

very dull. Chapters II. to VI., inclusive, are simply a record 
of experiments. Nevertheless, I believe (though a man can 
never judge his own books) that the book is valuable. You 
will have to decide whether it is worth translating. I hope 
so. It has cost me very great labour, and the results seem 
to me remarkable and well established. 

If you translate it, you could easily get aid for Chapters 
II. to VI., as there is here endless, but, I have thought, 
necessary repetition. I shall be anxious to hear what you 
decide 

I most sincerely hope that your health has been fairly 
good this summer. 

My dear Sir, yours very truly,

Down, October 28, 1876. 

My DEAR Gray, — I send by this post all the clean sheets 
as yet printed, and I hope to send the remainder within a 
fortnight. Please observe that the first six chapters are not 
readable, and the six last very dull. Still I believe that the 
results are valuable. If you review the book, I shall be very 
curious to see what you think of it, for I care more for your 
judgment than for that of almost any one else. I know also 
that you will speak the truth, whether you approve or dis- 
approve. Very few will take the trouble to read the book, 
and I do not expect you to read the whole, but I hope you 
will read the latter chapters.

horrid bad style into intelligible English.

Down, February 16, 1877. 

Dear Dyer, — I must tell you how greatly I am pleased 
and honoured by your article in ‘ Nature,’ which I have just 
read. You are an adept in saying what will please an author, 
not that I suppose you wrote with this express intention. 
I should be very well contented to deserve a fraction of your 
praise. I have also been much interested, and this is better 
than mere pleasure, by your argument about the separation 
of the sexes. I dare say that I am wrong, and will hereafter 
consider what you say more carefully : but at present I can- 
not drive out of my head that the sexes must have originated 
from two individuals, slightly different, which conjugated. 
But I am aware that some cases of conjugation are opposed 
to any such views. 

With hearty thanks, 

Yours sincerely, 
Charles Darwin.

CHAPTER IX. 



‘DIFFERENT FORMS OF FLOWERS ON PLANTS OF THE 
SAME SPECIES.’ 1 877. 

[The volume bearing the above title was published in 1877, 
and was dedicated by the author to Professor Asa Gray, “ as 
a small tribute of respect and affection.” It consists of 
certain earlier papers re-edited, with the addition of a 
quantity of new matter. The subjects treated in the book 

(i.) Heterostyled Plants. 

(ii.) Polygamous, Dicecious, and Gynodicecious Plants. 

(iii.) Cleistogamic Flowers. 

The nature of heterostyled plants may be illustrated in the 
primrose, one of the best known examples of the class. If a 
number of primroses be gathered, it will be found that some 
plants yield nothing but “ pin-eyed ” flowers, in which the 
style (or organ for the transmission of the pollen to the ovule) 
is long, while the others yield only “ thrum-eyed ” flowers with 
short styles. Thus primroses are divided into two sets or 
castes differing structurally from each other. My father 
showed that they also differ sexually, and that in fact the bond 
between the two castes more nearly resembles that between 
separate sexes than any other known relationship. Thus for 
example a long-styled primrose, though it can be fertilised by 
its own pollen, is not fully fertile unless it is impregnated by 
the pollen of a short-styled flower. Heterostyled plants are 
comparable to hermaphrodite animals, such as snails, which 
require the concourse of two individuals, although each pos- 



2 96 ‘DIFFERENT FORMS OF FLOWERS 

sesses both the sexual elements. The difference is that in 
the case of the primrose it is perfect fertility, and not simply 
fertility, that depends on the mutual action of the two sets of 
individuals. 

The work on heterostyled plants has a special bearing, to 
which the author attached much importance, on the problem 
of origin of species.* 

He found that a wonderfully close parallelism exists 
between hybridisation and certain forms of fertilisation 
among heterostyled plants. So that it is hardly an exag- 
geration to say that the “ illegitimately ” reared seedlings are 
hybrids, although both their parents belong to identically the 
same species. In a letter to Professor Huxley, given in the 
second volume (p. 384), my father writes as if his researches 
on heterostyled plants tended to make him believe that 
sterility is a selected or acquired quality. But in his later 
publications, eg. in the sixth edition of the ‘Origin,’ he 
adheres to the belief that sterility is an incidental rather than 
a selected quality. The result of his work on heterostyled 
plants is of importance as showing that sterility is no test 
of specific distinctness, and that it depends on differentiation 
of the sexual elements which is independent of any racial 
difference. I imagine that it was his instinctive love of 
making out a difficulty which to a great extent kept him 
at work so patiently on the heterostyled plants. But it 
was the fact that general conclusions of the above character 
could be drawn from his results which made him think his 
results worthy of publication.! 

The papers which on this subject preceded and contributed 
to ‘ Forms of Flowers ’ were the following : —

of Primula, and on their remarkable Sexual Relations." Linn. 
Soc. Journal, 1862.

The following letter shows that he began the work on 
heterostyled plants with an erroneous view as to the meaning 
of the facts.] 



C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, May 7 [i860]. 

.... I have this morning been looking at my experi- 
mental cowslips, and I find some plants have all flowers with 
long stamens and short pistils, which I will call “ male plants,” 
others with short stamens and long pistils, which I will call 
"female plants.” This I have somewhere seen noticed, I 
think by Henslow ; but I find (after looking at my two sets 
of [plants) that the stigmas of the male and female are of 
slightly different shape, and certainly different degree of 
roughness, and what has astonished me, the pollen of the 
so-called female plant, though very abundant, is more trans- 
parent, and each granule is exactly only § of the size of the 
pollen of the so-called male plants. Has this been observed ? 
I cannot help suspecting [that] the cowslip is in fact dioecious, 
but it may turn out all a blunder, but anyhow I will mark with 
sticks the so-called male and female plants and watch their

seeding. It would be a fine case of gradation between an 
hermaphrodite and unisexual condition. Likewise a sort of 
case of balancement of long and short pistils and stamens. 
Likewise perhaps throws light on oxlips. ... ii 

I have now examined primroses and find exactly the same 
difference in the size of the pollen, correlated with the same 
difference in the length of the style and roughness of the 
stigmas. 

C. Darwin to Asa Gray. 

June 8 [i860]. 

.... I have been making some little trifling observations 
which have interested and perplexed me much. I find with 
primroses and cowslips, that about an equal number of plants 
are thus characterised. 

So-called (by me) male plant Pistil much shorter than 
stamens ; stigma rather smooth,— pollen grains large, throat 
of corolla short. 

So-called female plant. Pistil much longer than stamens, 
stigma rougher , pollen-grains smaller, — throat of corolla long. 

I have marked a lot of plants, and expected to find the so- 
called male plant barren ; but judging from the feel of the 
capsules, this is not the case, and I am very much surprised at 
the difference in the size of the pollen. ... If it should 
prove that the so-called male plants produce less seed than 
the so-called females, what a beautiful case of gradation from 
hermaphrodite to unisexual condition it will be ! If they pro- 
duce about equal number of seed, how perplexing it will be. 

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker.

i860.] on plants of the same species.’ 299 

.... In the spring I must get you to look for long pistils and 
short pistils in the rarer species of Primula and in some allied 
Genera. It holds with P. Sinensis. You remember all the 
fuss I made on this subject last spring ; well, the other day 
at last I had time to weigh the seeds, and by Jove the plants 
of primrose and cowslip with short pistils and large grained 
pollen * are rather more fertile than those with long pistils, 
and small-grained pollen. I find that they require the action 
of insects to set them, and I never will believe that these 
differences are without some meaning. 

Some of my experiments lead me to suspect that the large- 
grained pollen suits the long pistils and the small-grained 
pollen suits the short pistils ; but I am determined to see if I 
cannot make out the mystery next spring. 

How does your book on plants brew in your mind ? Have 
you begun it? . . , 

Remember me most kindly to Oliver. He must be 
astonished at not having a string of questions, I fear he will 
get out of practice 1 

[The Primula-work was finished in the autumn of 1861, and 
on Nov. 8th he wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker : — 

“ I have sent my paper on dimorphism in Primula to the 
Linn. Sot I shall go up and read it whenever it comes on ; 
I hope you may be able to attend, for I do not suppose many 
will care a penny for the subject.” 

With regard to the reading of the paper (on Nov. 21st), he 
wrote to the same friend : — 

"I by no means thought that I produced a “tremendous 
effect " in the Linn. Soc., but by Jove the Linn. Soc., pro- 
duced a tremendous effect on me, for I could not get out of 
bed till late next evening, so that I just crawled home. I 
fear I must give up trying to read any paper or speak ; it is 
a horrid bore, I can do nothing like other peoplt

DIFFERENT FORMS OF FLOWERS [l86l. 



To Dr. Gray he wrote, (Dec. 1861) : — 

“ You may rely on it, I will send you a copy of my Primula 
paper as soon as I can get one ; but I believe it will not be 
printed till April 1st, and therefore after my Orchid Book. I 
care more for your and Hooker’s opinion than for that of all 
the rest of the world, and for Lyell’s on geological points. 
Bentham and Hooker thought well of my paper when read ; 
but no one can judge of evidence by merely hearing a 
paper.” 

The work on Primula was the means of bringing my 
father in contact with the late Mr. John Scott, then working 
as a gardener in the Botanic Gardens at Edinburgh,— an 
employment which he seems to have chosen in order to 
gratify his passion for natural history. He wrote one or two 
excellent botanical papers, and ultimately obtained a post in 
India.* He died in 1880. 

A few phrases may be quoted from letters to Sir J. D. 
Hooker, showing my father’s estimate of Scott : — 

“If you know, do please tell me who is John Scott of the 
Botanical Gardens of Edinburgh ; I have been corresponding 
largely with him ; he is no common man.” 

“ If he had leisure he would make a wonderful observer; to 
my judgment I have come across no one like him.” 

“ He has interested me strangely, and I have formed a very 
high opinion of his intellect I hope he will accept pecuniary 
assistance from me ; but he has hitherto refused.” (He 
ultimately succeeded in being allowed to pay for Mr. Scott’s 
passage to India.) 

“ I know nothing of him excepting from his letters ; these 
show remarkable talent, astonishing perseverance, much 
modesty, and what I admire, determined difference from me 
on many points.” 

So highly did he estimate Scott’s abilities that he formed

a plan (which however never went beyond an early stage of 
discussion) of employing him to work out certain problems 
connected with intercrossing. 



The following letter refers to my father’s investigations 
on Lythrum* a plant which reveals even a more wonderful 
condition of sexual complexity than that of Primula. For 
in Lythrum there are not merely two, but three castes, 
differing structurally and physiologically from each other :] 



C. Darwin to Asa Gray. 

Down, August 9 [1862]. 

My dear Gray,— I t is late at night, and I am going to 
write briefly, and of course to beg a favour. 

The Mitchella very good, but pollen apparently equal- 
sized. I have just examined Hottonia, grand difference in 
pollen. Echiurn vulgare, a humbug, merely a case like 
Thymus. But I am almost stark staring mad over Lythrum ; t 
if I can prove what I fully believe ; it is a grand case of 
TRIMORPHISM, with three different pollens and three stigmas ; 
I have castrated and fertilised above ninety flowers, trying all 
the eighteen distinct crosses which are possible within the 
limits of this one species ! I cannot explain, but I feel sure 
you would think it a grand case. I have been writing to 
Botanists to see if I can possibly get L. hyssopifolia, and it has 
just flashed on me that you might have Lythrum in North 
America, and I have looked to your Manual. For the love 



* He was led to this, his first 
case of trimorphism, by Lecoq’s 
‘ Geographic Botanique,’ and this 
must have consoled him for the 
trick this work played him in turn- 
ing out to be so much larger than 
he expected. He wrote to Sir J. 
D. Hooker : “ Here is a good joke :

graph. Bot,’ and ordered it and 
hoped that it was a good sired 
pamphlet, and nine thick volumes

Your utterly mad friend, 

C. Darwin. 

P.S. — There is reason in my madness, for I can see that to 
those who already believe in change of species, these facts 
will modify to a certain extent the whole view of Hybridity.* 

[On the same subject he wrote to Sir Joseph Hooker in 
August 1862 : — 

“Is Oliver at Kew? When I am established at Bourne- 
mouth I am completely mad to examine any fresh flowers of 
any Lythraceous plant, and I would write and ask him if any 
are in bloom.” 

Again he wrote to the same friend in October : — 

“ If you ask Oliver, I think he will tell you I have got a 
real odd case in Lythrum, it interests me extremely, and 
seems to me the strangest case of propagation recorded 
amongst plants or animals, viz. a necessary triple alliance 
between three hermaphrodites. I feel sure I can now prove 
the truth of the case from a multitude of crosses made this 
summer.” 



* A letter to Dr." Gray (July, 
1862) bears on this point : “ A few 
days ago I made an observation 
which has surprised me more than 
it ought to do— it will have to be 
repeated several times, but I have 
scarcely a doubt of its accuracy. I 
stated in my Primula paper that 
the long-styled form of Linum 
grandijlorum was utterly sterile 
with its own pollen ; I have lately 
been putting the pollen of the two 
forms on the division of the stigma 
of the same flower ; and it strikes 



me as truly wonderful, that the 
stigma distinguishes the pollen; 
and is penetrated by the tubes of 
the one and not by those of the 
other ; nor are the tubes exserted. 
Or (which is the same thing) the 
stigma of the one form acts on and 
is acted on by pollen, which produces 
not the least effect on the stigma of 
the other form. Taking sexual 
power as the criterion of difference, 
the two forms of this one species 
may be said to be generically 
distinct.”

In an article, ‘Dimorphism in the Genitalia of Plants’ 
(‘ Silliman’s Journal,’ 1862, vol. xxxiv. p. 419), Dr. Gray points 
out that the structural difference between the two forms of 
Primula had already been defined in the ‘ Flora of N. America,’ 
as dicecio-dimorphism. The use of this term called forth the 
following remarks from my father. The letter also alludes 
to a review of the ‘ Fertilisation of Orchids ’ in the same 
volume of ‘ Silliman’s Journal.’]

Down, November 26 [1862].

I feared might have been lost, reached me. We were all very 
much interested by the political part of your letter ; and in 
some odd way one never feels that information and opinions 
printed in a newspaper come from a living source ; they seem 
dead, whereas all that you write is full of life. The reviews 
interested me profoundly; you rashly ask for my opinion, 
and you must consequently endure a long letter. First for 
Dimorphism ; I do not at present like the term “ Dicecio- 
dimorphism ;’’ for I think it gives quite a false notion, that 
the phenomena are connected with a separation of the sexes. 
Certainly in Primula there is unequal fertility in the two 
forms, and I suspect this is the case with Linum; and, 
therefore, I felt bound in the Primula paper to state that it 
might be a step towards a dioecious condition; though I 
believe there are no dioecious forms in Primulaceae or Linacem. 
But the three forms in Lythrum convince me that the 
phenomenon is in no way necessarily connected with any 
tendency to separation of sexes. The case seems to me in 
result or function to be almost identical with what old 
C. K. Sprengel called “dichogamy,” and which is so frequent 
in truly hermaphrodite groups ; namely, the pollen and stigma

‘ DIFFERENT FORMS OF FLOWERS [1862. 



of each flower being mature at different periods. If I am right, 
it is very advisable not to use the term “ dioecious,” as this 
at once brings notions of separation of sexes. 

... I was much perplexed by Oliver’s remarks in the 
‘ Natural History Review ’ on the Primula case, on the lower 
plants having sexes more often of the separated than in the 
higher plants, — so exactly the reverse of what takes place 
in animals. Hooker in his review of the ‘Orchids’ repeats 
this remark. There seems to be much truth in what you 
say,* and it did not occur to me, about no improbability of 
specialisation in certain lines in lowly organised beings. I 
could hardly doubt that the hermaphrodite state is the 
aboriginal one. But how is it in the conjugation of Con- 
fervae — is not one of the two individuals here in fact male, 
and the other female? I have been much puzzled by this 
contrast in sexual arrangements between plants and animals. 
Can there be anything in the following consideration : By 
roughest calculation about one-third of the British genera of 
aquatic plants belong to the Linnean classes of Mono and 
Dicecia ; whilst of terrestrial plants (the aquatic genera being 
subtracted) only one-thirteenth of the genera belong to these 
two classes. Is there any truth in this fact generally ? Can 
aquatic plants, being confined to a small area or small com- 
munity of individuals, require more free crossing, and there- 
fore have separate sexes ? But to return to one point, does 
not Alph. de Candolle say that aquatic plants taken as a 
whole are lowly organised, compared with terrestrial ; and 
may not Oliver’s remark on the separation of the sexes in 
lowly organised plants stand in some relation to their being 
frequently aquatic ? Or is this all rubbish ? 

.... What a magnificent compliment you end your review 
with 1 You and Hooker seem determined to turn my head

[The following passage from a letter (July 28, 1863), to 
Prof. Hildebrand, contains a reference to the reception of the 
dimorphic work in France : — 

“ I am extremely much pleased to hear that you have been 
looking at the manner of fertilisation of your native Orchids, 
and still more pleased to hear that you have been experi- 
menting on Linum. I much hope that you may publish the 
result of these experiments ; because I was told that the most 
eminent French botanists of Paris said that my paper on 
Primula was the work of imagination, and that the case was 
so improbable they did not believe in my results.”]

April 19 [1864]. 

.... I received a little time ago a paper with a good 
account of your Herbarium and Library, and a long time 
previously your excellent review of Scott’s * Primulacese,’ and I 
forwarded it to him in India, as it would much please him. I 
was very glad to see in it a new case of Dimorphism (I forget 
just now the name of the plant) ; I shall be grateful to hear 
of any other cases, as I still feel an interest in the subject 
I should be very glad to get some seed of your dimorphic 
Plantagos ; for I cannot banish the suspicion that they must 
belong to a very different class like that of the common 
Thyme.* How could the wind, which is the agent of fertilisa- 
tion, with Plantago, fertilise “ reciprocally dimorphic ” flowers 
like Primula ? Theory says this cannot be, and in such cases

dried forms of Plantago. Indeed, any dried dimorphic plants

more for your opinion than that of all the rest of the world. 
I have done nothing which has interested me so much as 
Lythrum, since making out the complemental males of Cirri- 
pedes. I fear that I have dragged in too much miscellaneous 
matter into the paper.

Selection is making great progress in Germany, and some

tainly a hybrid between the primrose and cowslip ; whilst the

horrid fact for all systematic botanists

My dear Sir, — I wrote my last note in such a hurry from 
London, that I quite forgot what I chiefly wished to say, 
namely to thank you for your excellent notices in the ‘ Bot. 
Zeitung ’ of my paper on the offspring of dimorphic plants. 
The subject is so obscure that I did not expect that any one 
would have noticed my paper, and I am accordingly very 
much pleased that you should have brought the subject 
before the many excellent naturalists of Germany. 

Of all the German authors (but they are not many) whose 
works I have read, you write by far the clearest style, but 
whether this is a compliment to a German writer I do not

never shed, or never leave the anther-cells, but emit long 
pollen tubes, which penetrate the stigma. To-day I got the 
anther with the included pollen grain (now empty) at one 
end, and a bundle of tubes penetrating the stigmatic tissue at 
the other end ; I got the whole under a microscope without 
breaking the tubes ; I wonder whether the stigma pours some 
fluid into the anther so as to excite the included grains. It is 
a rather odd case of correlation, that in the double sweet 
violet the little flowers arc double ; i.e., have a multitude of 
minute scales representing the petals. What queer little 
flowers they are.

differences of plants :] 

C. Darwin to Asa Gray. 

November 26 [1862]. 

.... You will think that I am in the most unpleasant, con- 
tradictory, fractious humour, when I tell you that I do not like 
your term of “ precocious fertilisation ” for your second class 
of dimorphism \i.e. for cleistogamic fertilisation]. If I can 
trust my memory, the state of the corolla, of the stigma, and 
the pollen-grains is different from the state of the parts in the 
bud ; that they are in a condition of special modification. 
But upon my life I am ashamed of myself to differ so much 
from my betters on this head. The temporary theory* which 
I have formed on this class of dimorphism, just to guide 
experiment, is that the perfect flowers can only be perfectly

fertilised by insects, and are in this case abundantly crossed ; 
but that the flowers are not always, especially in early spring, 
visited enough by insects, and therefore the little imperfect 
self-fertilising flowers are developed to ensure a sufficiency of 
seed for present generations. Viola canina is sterile, when 
not visited by insects, but when so visited forms plenty of 
seed. I infer from the structure of three or four forms of Bal- 
saminea, that these require insects ; at least there is almost 
as plain adaptation to insects as in Orchids. I have Oxalis 
acetosella ready in pots for experiment next spring ; and I 
fear this will upset my little theory. . . . Campanula carpa- 
tkica, as I found this summer, is absolutely sterile if insects 
are excluded. Specularia speculum is fairly fertile when 
enclosed ; and this seemed to me to be partially effected by 
the frequent closing of the flower ; the inward angular folds 
of the corolla corresponding with the clefts of the open 
stigma, and in this action pushing pollen from the outside of 
the stigma on to its surface. Now can you tell me, does 5 . 
perfoliata close its flower like 5 . speculum, with angular inward 
folds ? if so, I am smashed without some fearful “ wriggling.” 
Are the imperfect flowers of your Specularia the early or the 
later ones ? very early or very late ? It is rather pretty to 
see the importance of the closing of flowers of 5 . speculum. 

[‘Forms of Flowers’ was published in July 1877 ; in 
June he wrote to Professor Carus with regard to the 
translation : — 

“ My new book is not a long one, viz. 350 pages, chiefly of 
the larger type, with fifteen simple woodcuts. All the proofs 
are corrected except the Index, so that it will soon be 
published. 

“. ... I do not suppose that I shall publish any more 
books, though perhaps a few more papers. I cannot endure 
being idle, but heaven knows whether I am capable of any 
more good work.”

CHAPTER X. 



CLIMBING AND INSECTIVOROUS PLANTS. 

[My father mentions in his ‘Autobiography’ (vol. L p. 92) 
that he was led to take up the subject of climbing plants 
by reading Dr. Gray’s paper, “Note on the Coiling of the 
Tendrils of Plants.” • This essay seems to have been read 
in 1862, but I am only able to guess at the date of the letter 
in which he asks for a reference to it, so that the precise 
date of his beginning this work cannot be determined. 

In June 1863 he was certainly at work, and wrote to Sir J. 
D. Hooker for information as to previous publications on the 
subject, being then in ignorance of Palm’s and H. v. Mohl’s 
works on climbing plants, both of which were published in

C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down [June] 25 [1863]. 

My DEAR HOOKER, — I have been observing pretty care- 
fully a little fact which has surprised me ; and I want to know 
from you and Oliver whether it seems new or odd to you, so 
just tell me whenever you write ; it is a very trifling fact, so do 
not answer on purpose. 

I have got a plant of Echinocystis lobata to observe the 
irritability of the tendrils described by Asa Gray, and which 
of course, is plain enough. Having the plant in my study, 
I have been surprised to find that the uppermost part of each

branch (t.t. the stem between the two uppermost leaves ex- 
cluding the growing tip) is constantly and slowly twisting roind 
making a circle in from one and a half to two hours ; it will 
sometimes go round two or three times, and then at the same 
rate untwists and twists in opposite directions. It generally 
rests half an hour before it retrogrades. The stem does not 
become permanently twisted. The stem beneath the twisting 
portion does not move in the least, though not tied. The move- 
ment goes on all day and all early night. It has no relation to 
light, for the plant stands in my window and twists from the 
light just as quickly as towards it This may be a common 
phenomenon for what I know, but it confounded me quite, 
when I began to observe the irritability of the tendrils. I do 
not say it is the final cause, but the result is pretty, for the plant 
every one and a half or two hours sweeps a circle (according 
to the length of the bending shoot and the length of the 
tendril) of from one foot to twenty inches in diameter, and 
immediately that the tendril touches any object its sensitive- 
ness causes it immediately to seize it ; a clever gardener, my 
neighbour, who saw the plant on my table last night, said : 
"I believe, Sir, the tendrils can see, for wherever I put a 
plant it finds out any stick near enough.” I believe the 
above is the explanation, viz. that it sweeps slowly round and 
round. The tendrils have some sense, for they do not grasp 
each other when young. 

Yours affectionately, 

C. Darwin. 



C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, July 14 [1863]. 

My DEAR HOOKER, — I am getting very much amused by 
my tendrils, it is just the sort of niggling work which suits 
me, and takes up no time and rather rests me whilst writing. 
So will you just think whether you know any plant, which

313 



you could give or lend me, or I could buy, with tendrils, re- 
markable in any way for development, for odd or peculiar 
structure, or even for an odd place in natural arrangement. I 
have seen or can see Cucurbitaceae, Passion-flower, Virginian- 
creeper, Cissus discolor , Common-pea and Everlasting-pea. It 
is really curious the diversification of irritability (I do not 
mean the spontaneous movement, about which I wrote before 
and correctly, as further observation shows) ; for instance, I find 
a slight pinch between the thumb and finger at the end of the 
tendril of the Cucurbitaceae causes prompt movement, but a 
pinch excites no movement in Cissus. The cause is that one 
side alone (the concave) is irritable in the former ; whereas both 
sides are irritable in Cissus, so if you excite at the same time 
both opposite sides there is no movement, but by touching 
with a pencil the two branches of the tendril, in any part 
whatever, you cause movement towards that point; so that 
I can mould, by a mere touch, the two branches into any 
shape I like. . . , 



C. Darwin to Asa Gray. 

Down, August 4 [1863]. 

My present hobby-horse I owe to you, viz. the tendrils : 
their irritability is beautiful, as beautiful in all its modifica- 
tions as anything in Orchids. About the spontaneous move- 
ment (independent of touch) of the tendrils and upper inter- 
nodes, I am rather taken aback by your saying, “ is it not well 
known ? ” I can find nothing in any book which I have. . . . 
The spontaneous movement of the tendrils is independent of 
the movement of the upper intemodes, but both work har- 
moniously together in sweeping a circle for the tendrils to 
grasp a stick. So with all climbing plants (without tendrils) 
as yet examined, the upper intemodes go on night and day 
sweeping a circle in one fixed direction. It is surprising to 
watch the Apocynese with shoots 18 inches long (beyond the 
supporting stick), steadily searching for something to climb

CLIMBING AND 



[1864. 



up. When the shoot meets a stick, the motion at that point 
is arrested, but in the upper part is continued ; so that the 
climbing of all plants yet examined is the simple result of the 
spontaneous circulatory movement of the upper internodes. 
Pray tell me whether anything has been published on this 
subject ? I hate publishing what is old ; but I shall hardly 
regret my work if it is old, as it has much amused me. . . . 

C. Darwin to Asa Gray. 

May 28, 1864. 

.... An Irish nobleman on his death-bed declared that he 
could conscientiously say that he had never throughout life 
denied himself any pleasure ; and I can conscientiously say 
that I have never scrupled to trouble you ; so here goes.— 
Have you travelled South, and can you tell me whether the 
trees, which Bignonia capreolata climbs, are covered with 
moss or filamentous lichen or Tillandsia ? * I ask because its 
tendrils abhor a simple stick, do not much relish rough bark, 
but delight in wool or moss. They adhere in a curious 
manner by making little disks, like the Ampelopsis. ... By 
the way, I will enclose some specimens, and if you think it 
worth while, you can put them under the simple microscope. 
It is remarkable how specially adapted some tendrils are; 
those of Eccretnocarpus scaber do not like a stick, will have 
nothing to say to wool ; but give them a bundle of culms of 
grass, or a bundle of bristles and they seize them well.

find that I have a good deal of new matter. It is strange, 
but I really think no one has explained simple twining 
plants. These books have stirred me up, and made me 
wish for plants specified in them. I shall be very glad of 
those you mention. I have written to Veitch for young 
Nepenthes and Vanilla (which I believe will turn out a grand 
case, though a root creeper), and if I cannot buy young 
Vanilla I will ask you. I have ordered a leaf-climbing fern, 
Lygodium. All this work about climbers would hurt my 
conscience, did I think I could do harder work.* 

[He continued his observations on climbing plants during 
the prolonged illness from which he suffered in the autumn 
of 1863, and in the following spring. He wrote to Sir J. D. 
Hooker, apparently in March 1864 : — 

" For several days I have been decidedly better, and what 
I lay much stress on (whatever doctors say), my brain feels 
far stronger, and I have lost many dreadful sensations. The 
hot-house is such an amusement to me, and my amusement 
I owe to you, as my delight is to look at the many odd 
leaves and plants from Kew. . . . The only approach to 
work which I can do is to look at tendrils and climbers, 
this does not distress my weakened brain. Ask Oliver to 
look over the enclosed queries (and do you look) and amuse 
a broken-down brother naturalist by answering any which 
he can. If you ever lounge through your houses, remember 
me and climbing plants.” 

On October 29, 1864, he wrote to Dr. Gray : — 

“ I have not been able to resist doing a little more at your 
godchild, my climbing paper, or rather in size little book, 
which by Jove I will have copied out, else I shall never stop. 
This has been new sort of work for me, and I have been 
pleased to find what a capital guide for observations a full 
conviction of the change of species is.” 

On Jan. 19, 1865, he wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker: — 

* He was much out of health at this time.

“ It is working hours, but I am trying to take a day’s 
holiday, for I finished and despatched yesterday my climbing 
paper. For the last ten days I have done nothing but correct 
refractory sentences, and I loathe the whole subject.” 

A letter to Dr. Gray, April 9, 1865, has a word or two on 
the subject. — 

“ I have begun correcting proofs of my paper on * Climbing 
Plants.’ I suppose I shall be able to send you a copy in four 
or five weeks. I think it contains a good deal new and some 
curious points, but it is so fearfully long, that no one will ever 
read it If, however, you do not skim through it, you will be 
an unnatural parent, for it is your child.” 

Dr. Gray not only read it but approved of it, to my father’s 
great satisfaction, as the following extracts show : — 

“ I was much pleased to get your letter of July 24th. Now 
that I can do nothing, I maunder over old subjects, and your 
approbation of my climbing paper gives me very great satis- 
faction. I made my observations when I could do nothing 
else and much enjoyed it, but always doubted whether they 
were worth publishing. I demur to its not being necessary 
to explain in detail about the spires in caught tendrils run- 
ning in opposite directions ; for the fact for a long time con- 
founded me, and I have found it difficult enough to explain 
the cause to two or three persons.” (Aug. 15, 1865.) 

“ I received yesterday your article * on climbers, and it has 
pleased me in an extraordinary and even silly manner. You 
pay me a superb compliment, and as I have just said to my 
wife, I think my friends must perceive that I like praise, 
they give me such hearty doses. I always admire your skill 
in reviews or abstracts, and you have done this article ex- 
cellently and given the whole essence of my paper. .... I 
have had a letter from a good Zoologist in S. Brazil, F. 
Muller, who has been stirred up to observe climbers and

gives me some curious cases of £ra«c//-climbers, in which 
branches are converted into tendrils, and then continue to 
grow and throw out leaves and new branches, and then lose 
their tendril character.” (October 1865.) 

The paper on Climbing Plants was republished in 1875, as 
a separate book. The author had been unable to give his 
customary amount of care to the style of the original essay, 
owing to the fact that it was written during a period of 
continued ill-health, and it was now found to require a great 
deal of alteration. He wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker (March 3, 
1875) : * It is lucky for authors in general that they do not 
require such dreadful work in merely licking what they write 
into shape.” And to Mr. Murray in September he wrote : 
“The corrections are heavy in ‘Climbing Plants,’ and yet 
1 deliberately went over the MS. and old sheets three times.” 
The book was published in September 1875, an edition of 
1500 copies was struck off; the edition sold fairly well, and 
500 additional copies were printed in June of the following 
year.] 

INSECTIVOROUS PLANTS. 

[In the summer of i860 he was staying at the house of his 
sister-in-law, Miss Wedgwood, in Ashdown Forest, whence 
he wrote (July 29, i860), to Sir Joseph Hooker : — 

“ Latterly I have done nothing here ; but at first I amused 
myself with a few observations on the insect-catching power 
of Drosera ; and I must consult you some time whether my 
' twaddle ’ is worth communicating to the Linnean Society.” 

In August he wrote to the same friend : — 

“ I will gratefully send my notes on Drosera when copied 
by my copier : the subject amused me when I had nothing 
to do." 

He has described in the ‘Autobiography ’ (vol. i. p. 95), the 
general nature of these early experiments. He noticed insects 
sticking to the leaves, and finding that flies, &c., placed on

the adhesive glands were held fast and embraced, he sus- 
pected that the leaves were adapted to supply nitrogenous 
food to the plant. He therefore tried the effect on the leaves 
of various nitrogenous fluids — with results which, as far as 
they went, verified his surmise. In September, i860, he wrote 
to Dr. Gray : — 

“ I have been infinitely amused by working at Drosera : 
the movements are really curious ; and the manner in which 
the leaves detect certain nitrogenous compounds is mar- 
vellous. You will laugh ; but it is, at present, my full belief 
(after endless experiments) that they detect (and move in 
consequence of) the 5^ part of a single grain of nitrate of 
ammonia ; but the muriate and sulphate of ammonia bother 
their chemical skill, and they cannot make anything of the 
nitrogen in these salts 1 I began this work on Drosera in 
relation to gradation as throwing light on Dionaea.” 

Later in the autumn he was again obliged to leave home 
for Eastbourne, where he continued his work on Drosera. 
The work was so new to him that he found himself in diffi- 
culties in the preparation of solutions, and became puzzled 
over fluid and solid ounces, &c. &c. To a friend, the late 
Mr. E. Cresy, who came to his help in the matter of weights 
and measures, he wrote giving an account of the experiments. 
The extract (November 2, i860) which follows illustrates 
the almost superstitious precautions he often applied to his 
researches : — 

“ Generally I have scrutinised every gland and hair on the 
leaf before experimenting ; but it occurred to me that I might 
in some way affect the leaf ; though this is almost impossible, 
as I scrutinised with equal care those that I put into distilled 
water (the same water being used for dissolving the carbonate 
of ammonia). I then cut off four leaves (not touching them 
with my fingers), and put them in plain water, and four other

no change on the four in water ; every gland and hair affected 
in those in ammonia. 

“I had measured the quantity of weak solution, and I 
counted the glands which had absorbed the ammonia, and 
were plainly affected ; the result convinced me that each 
gland could not have absorbed more than or i n inu °f 

a grain. I have tried numbers of other experiments all 
pointing to the same result. Some experiments lead me to 
believe that very sensitive leaves are acted on by much 
smaller doses. Reflect how little ammonia a plant can get 
growing on poor soil — yet it is nourished. The really sur- 
prising part seems to me that the effect should be visible, 
and not under very high power ; for after trying a high power, 

I thought it would be safer not to consider any effect which 
was not plainly visible under a two-thirds object glass and 
middle eye-piece. The effect which the carbonate of ammonia 
produces is the segregation of the homogeneous fluid in the 
cells into a cloud of granules and colourless fluid ; and 
subsequently the granules coalesce into larger masses, and for 
hours have the oddest movements — coalescing, dividing, 
coalescing ad infinitum. I do not know whether you will 
care for these ill-written details ; but, as you asked, I am sure 
I am bound to comply, after all the very kind and great 
trouble which you have taken.” 

On his return home he wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker 
(November 21, i860). — 

“ I have been working like a madman at Drosera. Here 
is a fact for you which is certain as you stand where you 
are, though you won’t believe it, that a bit of hair rs -J TO of 
one grain in weight placed on gland, will cause one of the 
gland-bearing hairs of Drosera to curve inwards, and will alter 
the condition of the contents of every cell in the foot-stalk of 
the gland.” 

And a few days later to Lyell : — 

“ I will and must finish my Drosera MS., which will take

me a week, for, at the present moment, I care more about 
Drosera than the origin of all the species in the world. But 
I will not publish on Drosera till next year, for I am frightened 
and astounded at my results. I declare it is a certain fact, 
that one organ is so sensitive to touch, that a weight seventy- 
eight-times less than that, viz., of a grain, which will 
move the best chemical balance, suffices to cause a conspicu- 
ous movement. Is it not curious that a plant should be 
far more sensitive to the touch than any nerve in the human 
body ? Yet I am perfectly sure that this is true. When I 
am on my hobby-horse, I never can resist telling my friends 
how well my hobby goes, so you must forgive the rider." 

The work was continued, as a holiday task, at Bourne- 
mouth, where he stayed during the autumn of 1862. The dis- 
cussion in the following letter on “ nervous matter ” in Drosera 
is of interest in relation to recent researches on the continuity 
of protoplasm from cell to cell :] 



C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Cliff Cottage, Bournemouth. 

September 26 [1862]. 

My dear Hooker, — Do not read this till you have leisure. 
If that blessed moment ever comes, I should be very glad to 
have your opinion on the subject of this letter. I am led to 
the opinion that Drosera must have diffused matter in organic 
connection, closely analogous to the nervous matter of animals. 
When the glands of one of the papillae or tentacles, in its 
natural position is supplied with nitrogenised fluid and 
certain other stimulants, or when loaded with an extremely 
slight weight, or when struck several times with a needle, the 
pedicel bends near its base in under one minute. These 
varied stimulants are conveyed down the pedicel by some 
means ; it cannot be vibration, for drops of fluid put on quite 
quietly cause the movement ; it cannot be absorption of the

fluid from cell to cell, for I can see the rate of absorption, 
which though quick, is far slower, and in Dionaea the trans- 
mission is instantaneous ; analogy from animals would point 
to transmission through nervous matter. Reflecting on 
the rapid power of absorption in the glands, the extreme 
sensibility of the whole organ, and the conspicuous move- 
ment caused by varied stimulants, I have tried a number of 

substances which are not caustic or corrosive, 

but most of which are known to have a remarkable action 
on the nervous matter of animals. You will see the results 
in the enclosed paper. As the nervous matter of different 
animals are differently acted on by the same poisons, one 
would not expect the same action on plants and animals ; 
only, if plants have diffused nervous matter, some degree of 
analogous action. And this is partially the case. Consider- 
ing these experiments, together with the previously made 
remarks on the functions of the parts, I cannot avoid the 
conclusion, that Drosera possesses matter at least in some 
degree analogous in constitution and function to nervous 
matter. Now do tell me what you think, as far as you can 
judge from my abstract ; of course many more experiments 
would have to be tried ; but in former years I tried on 
the whole leaf, instead of on separate glands, a number of 
innocuous * substances, such as sugar, gum, starch, &c., and 
they produced no effect Your opinion will aid me in decid- 
ing some future year in going on with this subject I should 
not have thought it worth attempting, but I had nothing on 
earth to do. 

My dear Hooker, yours very sincerely, 

Ch. Darwin. 

P.S. — We return home on Monday 28th. Thank Heaven 1

[A long break now ensued in his work on insectivorous 
plants, and it was not till 1872 that the subject seriously- 
occupied him again. A passage in a letter to Dr. Asa Gray, 
written in 1863 or 1864, shows, however, that the question 
was not altogether absent from his mind in the interim : — 

“ Depend on it you are unjust on the merits of my beloved 
Drosera ; it is a wonderful plant, or rather a most sagacious 
animal. I will stick up for Drosera to the day of my death. 
Heaven knows whether I shall ever publish my pile of experi- 

He notes in his diary that the last proof of the ‘ Expression 
of the Emotions ’ was finished on August 22, 1872, and that 
he began to work on Drosera on the following day.] 



C. Darwin to Asa Gray. 

[Sevenoaks], October 22 [1872]. 

... I have worked pretty hard for four or five weeks on 
Drosera, and then broke down ; so that we took a house near 
Sevenoaks for three weeks (where I now am) to get complete 
rest. I have very little power of working now, and must put off 
the rest of the work on Drosera till next spring, as my plants 
are dying. It is an endless subject, and I must cut it short, 
and for this reason shall not do much on Dionaea. The 
point which has interested me most is tracing the nerves l 
which follow the vascular bundles. By a prick with a sharp 
lancet at a certain point, I can paralyse one-half the leaf, so 
that a stimulus to the other half causes no movement. It is 
just like dividing the spinal marrow of a frog : — no stimulus 
can be sent from the brain or anterior part of the spine to the 
hind legs ; but if these latter are stimulated, they move by 
reflex action. I find my old results about the astonishing 
sensitiveness of the nervous system (I ?) of Drosera to various 
stimulants fully confirmed and extended. . . .

the physiology of the plant soon led him into regions 
where his knowledge was defective, and here the advice and 
assistance which he received from Dr. Burdon Sanderson was 
of much value :] 

C. Darwin to J. Burdon Sanderson. 

Down, July 25, 1873- 

My dear Dr. Sanderson,— I should like to tell you a 
little about my recent work with Drosera, to show that I 
have profited by your suggestions, and to ask a question or 

1. It is really beautiful how quickly and well Drosera and 
Dionaea dissolve little cubes of albumen and gelatine. I kept 
the same sized cubes on wet moss for comparison. When 
you were here I forgot that I had tried gelatine, but albumen 
is far better for watching its dissolution and absorption. 
Frankland has told me how to test in a rough way for 
pepsine ; and in the autumn he will discover what acid the 
digestive juice contains. 

2. A decoction of cabbage-leaves and green peas causes 
as much inflection as an infusion of raw meat ; a decoction of 
grass is less powerful. Though I hear that the chemists try 
to precipitate all albumen from the extract of belladonna, I 
think they must fail, as the extract causes inflection, whereas 
a new lot of atropine, as well as the valerianate [of atropine], 
produce no effect. 

3. I have been trying a good many experiments with 
heated water. . . . Should you not call the following case one 
of heat rigor ? Two leaves were heated to 130° and had every 
tentacle closely inflected ; one was taken out and placed in 
cold water, and it re-expanded ; the other was heated to 145 0 , 
and had not the least power of re-expansion. Is not this 
latter case heat rigor ? If you can inform me, I should very 
much like to hear at what temperature cold-blooded and 
invertebrate animals are killed. 



324 CLIMBING AND [1873. 

4. I must tell you my final result, of which I am sure, 
[as to] the sensitiveness of Drosera. I made a solution of 
one part of phosphate of ammonia by weight to 218,750 
of water; of this solution I gave so much that a leaf 
got -gtfoQ of a grain of the phosphate. I then counted the 
glands, and each could have got only n i z h smt a g ra ' n i 
this being absorbed by the glands, sufficed to cause the 
tentacles bearing these glands to bend through an angle of 
180°. Such sensitiveness requires hot weather, and carefully 
selected young yet mature leaves. It strikes me as a 
wonderful fact I must add that I took every precaution, by 
trying numerous leaves at the same time in the solution and 
in the same water which was used for making the solution. 

5. If you can persuade your friend to try the effects of 
carbonate of ammonia on the aggregation of the white blood 
corpuscles, I should very much like to hear the result. 

I hope this letter will not have wearied you. 

Believe me, yours very sincerely, 

Charles Darwin. 

C. Darwin to W. Thiselton Dyer. 

Down, 24 [December 1873 !} 

My dear Mr. Dyer,— I fear that you will think me a 
great bore, but I cannot resist telling you that I have just 
found out that the leaves of Pinguicula possess a beautifully 
adapted power of movement. Last night I put on a row of 
little flies near one edge of two youngish leaves ; and after 14 
hours these edges are beautifully folded over so as to clasp 
the flies, thus bringing the glands into contact with the upper 
surfaces of the flies, and they are now secreting copiously 
above and below the flies and no doubt absorbing. The acid 
secretion has run down the channelled edge and has collected 
in the spoon-shaped extremity, where no doubt the glands 
are absorbing the delicious soup. The leaf on one side looks

just like the helix of a human ear, if you were to stuff flies 
within the fold. 

Yours most sincerely, 

Ch. Darwin. 

C. Darwin to Asa Gray. 

Down, June 3 [1874], 

.... I am now hard at work getting my book on Drosera 
& Co. ready for the printers, but it will take some time, for I 
am always finding out new points to observe. I think you 
will be interested by my observations on the digestive process 
in Drosera ; the secretion contains an acid of the acetic series, 
and some ferment closely analogous to, but not identical 
with, pepsine ; for I have been making a long series of 
comparative trials. No human being will believe what I 
shall publish about the smallness of the doses of phosphate 
of ammonia which act.

and when I found it stated that Felis and Bos inhabited 
Madagascar, I thought it was a false story, and did not

to him, for which I return to you my cordial thanks. He 
tells me on your authority, of a fact which interests me in 
the highest degree, and which I much wish to be allowed to 
quote. It relates to the action of one millionth of a grain of 
atropine on the eye. Now will you be so kind, whenever you 
can find a little leisure, to tell me whether you yourself have

observed this fact, or believe it on good authority. I also 
wish to know what proportion by weight the atropine bore 
to the water of solution, and how much of the solution was 
applied to the eye. The reason why I am so anxious on this 
head is that it gives some support to certain facts repeatedly 
observed by me with respect to the action of phosphate of 
ammonia on Drosera. The 400&000 °f a grain absorbed by 
a gland clearly makes the tentacle which bears this gland 
become inflected ; and I am fully convinced that 8000*0000 
a grain of the crystallised salt (ie. containing about one-third 
of its weight of water of crystallisation) does the same. Now 
I am quite unhappy at the thought of having to publish such 
a statement. It will be of great value to me to be able to 
give any analogous facts in support The case of Drosera is 
all the more interesting as the absorption of the salt or any 
other stimulant applied to the gland causes it to transmit a 
motor influence to the base of the tentacle which bears the 
gland. 

Pray forgive me for troubling you, and do not trouble your- 
self to answer this until your health is fully re-established. 

Pray believe me, 

Yours very sincerely, 

Charles Darwin. 

[During the summer of 1874 he was at work on the genus 
Utricularia, and he wrote (July 16th) to Sir J. D. Hooker 
giving some account of the progress of his work : — 

" I am rather glad you have not been able to send Utricu- 
laria, for the common species has driven F. and me almost 
mad. The structure is most complex. The bladders catch 
a multitude of Entomostraca, and larvae of insects. The 
mechanism for capture is excellent But there is much that 
we cannot understand. From what I have seen to-day, 
strongly suspect that it is necrophagous, i.e. that it cannot 
digest, but absorbs decaying matter.”

He was indebted to Lady Dorothy Nevill for specimens of 
the curious Utricularia montana, which is not aquatic like the 
European species, but grows among the moss and dlbris on 
the branches of trees. To this species the following letter 
refers :] 

C. Darwin to Lady Dorothy Nevill. 

Down, September 18 [1874]. 

Dear Lady Dorothy Nevill,— I am so much obliged 
to you. I was so convinced that the bladders were with the 
leaves that I never thought of removing the moss, and this 
was very stupid of me. The great solid bladder-like swellings 
almost on the surface are wonderful objects, but are not the 
true bladders. These I found on the roots near the surface, 
and down to a depth of two inches in the sand. They are 
as transparent as glass, from to of an inch in size, and 
hollow. They have all the important points of structure of 
the bladders of the floating English species, and I felt con- 
fident I should find captured prey. And so I have to my 
delight in two bladders, with clear proof that they had absorbed 
food from the decaying mass. For Utricularia is a carrion- 
feeder, and not strictly carnivorous like Drosera. 

The great solid bladder-like bodies, I believe, are reservoirs 
of water like a camel’s stomach. As soon as I have made 
a few more observations, I mean to be so cruel as to give 
your plant no water, and observe whether the great bladders 
shrink and contain air instead of water; I shall then also 
wash all earth from all roots, and see whether there are true 
bladders for capturing subterranean insects down to the very 
bottom of the pot. Now shall you think me very greedy, if 
I say that supposing the species is not very precious, and 
you have several, will you give me one more plant, and if 
so, please to send it to “ Orpington Station, S. E. R., to be 
forwarded by foot messenger.”

great kindness. 

The seeds are very curious monsters ; I fancy of some 
plant allied to Medicago, but I will show them to Dr. Hooker. 

Your Ladyship’s very gratefully, 

Ch. Darwin. 



C. Darwin to J. D. Hooker. 

Down, September 30, 1874. 

My DEAR H., — Your magnificent present of Aldrovanda 
has arrived quite safe. I have enjoyed greatly a good look 
at the shut leaves, one of which I cut open. It is an aquatic 
Dionaea, which has acquired some structures identical with 
those of Utricularia 1 

If the leaves open, and I can transfer them open under 
the microscope, I will try some experiments, for mortal man 
cannot resist the temptation. If I cannot transfer, I will do 
nothing, for otherwise it would require hundreds of leaves. 

You are a good man to give me such pleasure. 

Yours affectionately, 

C. Darwin. 

[The manuscript of ‘ Insectivorous Plants ’ was finished in 
March 1875. He seems to have been more than usually 
oppressed by the writing of this book, thus he wrote to Sir 
J. D. Hooker in February : — 

“ You ask about my book, and all that I can say is that 
I am ready to commit suicide ; I thought it was decently 
written, but find so much wants rewriting, that it will not be 
ready to go to printers for two months, and will then make 
a confoundedly big book. Murray will say that it is no use 
publishing in the middle of summer, so I do not know what 
will be the upshot ; but I begin to think that every one who 
publishes a book is a fool.” 

The book was published on July 2nd, 1875, and 2700 copies 
were sold out of the edition of 3000.] 



CHAPTER XI. 



THE ‘ POWER OF MOVEMENT IN PLANTS.’ 1880. 

[The few sentences in the autobiographical chapter give with 
sufficient clearness the connection between the ‘Power of 
Movement,’ and one of the author's earlier books, that on 
' Climbing Plants.’ The central idea of the book is that the 
movements of plants in relation to light, gravitation, &c., 
are modifications of a spontaneous tendency to revolve or 
circumnutate, which is widely inherent in the growing parts 
of plants. This conception has not been generally adopted, 
and has not taken a place among the canons of orthodox 
physiology. The book has been treated by Professor Sachs 
with a few words of professorial contempt ; and by Professor 
Wiesner it has been honoured by careful and generously 
expressed criticism. 

Mr. Thiselton Dyer * has well said : “ Whether this masterly 
conception of the unity of what has hitherto seemed a chaos of 
unrelated phenomena will be sustained, time alone will show. 
But no one can doubt the importance of what Mr. Darwin 
has done, in showing that for the future the phenomena of 
plant movement can and indeed must be studied from a 
single point of view.” 

The work was begun in the summer of 1877, after the 
publication of * Different Forms of Flowers,’ and by the 
autumn his enthusiasm for the subject was thoroughly estab- 
lished, and he wrote to Mr. Dyer : “I am all on fire at the

work.” At this time he was studying the movements of 
cotyledons, in which the sleep of plants is to be observed in 
its simplest form ; in the following spring he was trying to 
discover what useful purpose these sleep-movements could 
serve, and wrote to Sir Joseph Hooker (March 25th, 1878):— 

“ I think we have proved that the sleep of plants is to lessen 
the injury to the leaves from radiation. This has interested 
me much, and has cost us great labour, as it has been a 
problem since the time of Linnaeus. But we have killed or 
badly injured a multitude of plants : N.B. — Oxalis camosa 
was most valuable, but last night was killed.” 

His letters of this period do not give any connected account 
of the progress of the work. The two following seem worth 
giving as being characteristic of the author :] 



C. Darwin to W. Thiselton Dyer. 

Down, June 2, 1878. 

My dear Dyer, — I remember saying that I should die a 
disgraced man if I did not observe a seedling Cactus and 
Cycas, and you have saved me from this horrible fate, as they 
move splendidly and normally. But I have two questions to 
ask : the Cycas observed was a huge seed in a broad and 
very shallow pot with cocoa-nut fibre as I suppose. It was 
named only Cycas. Was it Cycas pectinata t I suppose that 
I cannot be wrong in believing that what first appears above 
ground is a true leaf, for I can see no stem or axis. Lastly, 
you may remember that I said that we could not raise 
Opuntia nigricans ; now I must confess to a piece of stupidity ; 
one did come up, but my gardener and self stared at it, and 
concluded that it could not be a seedling Opuntia, but now that 
I have seen one of 0 . basilaris, I am sure it was ; I observed 
it only casually, and saw movements, which makes me wish

to observe carefully another. If you have any fruit, will Mr. 
Lynch • be so kind as to send one more ? 

I am working away like a slave at radicles [roots] and at 
movements of true leaves, for I have pretty well done with 
cotyledons. . . . 

That was an excellent letter about the Gardens : t I had 
hoped that the agitation was over. Politicians are a poor 
truckling lot, for [they] must see the wretched effects of 
keeping the gardens open all day long. 

Your ever troublesome friend, 

Ch. Darwin. 



C. Darwin to W. Thiselton Dyer. 

4 Bryanston St., Portman Square, 
November 21 [1878]. 

My DEAR Dyer, — I must thank you for all the wonderful 
trouble which you have taken about the seeds of Impatiens 
and on scores of other occasions. It in truth makes me feel 
ashamed of myself, and I cannot help thinking: “ Oh Lord, 
when he sees our book he will cry out, is this all for which I 
have helped so much ! ” In seriousness, I hope that we have 
made out some points, but I fear that we have done very little 
for the labour which we have expended on our work. We are 
here for a week for a little rest, which I needed. 

If I remember right, November 30th, is the anniversary at 
the Royal, and I fear Sir Joseph must be almost at the last 
gasp. I shall be glad when he is no longer President. 

Yours very sincerely, 

Ch. Darwin.

engaged in putting his results together, he wrote somewhat

despondingly to Mr. Dyer: “ I am overwhelmed with my 
notes, and almost too old to undertake the job which I have 
in hand — i.e., movements of all kinds. Yet it is worse to be 
idle." 

Later on in the year, when the work was approaching com- 
pletion, he wrote to Prof. Carus (July 17, 1879), with respect 
to a translation : — 

“ Together with my son Francis, I am preparing a rather 
large volume on the general movements of Plants, and I think 
that we have made out a good many new points and views. 

“ I fear that our views will meet a good deal of opposition 
in Germany ; but we have been working very hard for some 
years at the subject. 

“ I shall be much pleased if you think the book worth trans- 
lating, and proof-sheets shall be sent you, whenever they are 
ready.” 

In the autumn he was hard at work on the manuscript, and 
wrote to Dr. Gray (October 24, 1879) : — 

“ I have written a rather big book — more is the pity— on 
the movements of plants, and I am now just beginning to go 
over the MS. for the second time, which is a horrid bore.” 

Only the concluding part of the next letter refers to the 
‘ Power of Movement ’ :]

May 28, 1880. 

Mv DEAR SIR, — I am particularly obliged to you for having 
so kindly sent me your ‘ Phytographie * for if I had merely 
seen it advertised, I should not have supposed that it could 
have concerned me. As it is, I have read with very great 
interest about a quarter, but will not delay longer thanking 
you. All that you say seems to me very clear and con- 
vincing, and as in all your writings I find a large number of

philosophical remarks new to me, and no doubt shall find 
many more. They have recalled many a puzzle through 
which I passed when monographing the Cirripedia ; and your 
book in those days would have been quite invaluable to me. 
It has pleased me to find that I have always followed your 
plan of making notes on separate pieces of paper ; I keep 
several scores of large portfolios, arranged on very thin shelves 
about two inches apart, fastened to the walls of my study, 
and each shelf has its proper name or title ; and I can thus 
put at once every memorandum into its proper place. Your 
book will, I am sure, be very useful to many young students, 
and I shall beg my son Francis (who intends to devote himself 
to the physiology of plants) to read it carefully. 

As for myself I am taking a fortnight’s rest, after sending 
a pile of MS. to the printers, and it was a piece of good 
fortune that your book arrived as I was getting into my 
carriage, for I wanted something to read whilst away from 
home. My MS. relates to the movements of plants, and I 
think that I have succeeded in showing that all the more 
important great classes of movements are due to the modifi- 
cation of a kind of movement common to all parts of all 
plants from their earliest youth. 

Pray give my kind remembrances to your son, and with my 
highest respect and best thanks, 

Believe me, my dear Sir, yours very sincerely, 

Charles Darwin. 

P.S. — It always pleases me to exalt plants in the organic 
scale, and if you will take the trouble to read my last chapter 
when my book (which will be sadly too big) is published and 
sent to you, I hope and think that you also will admire some 
of the beautiful adaptations by which seedling plants are 
enabled to perform their proper functions.

copies were disposed of at Mr. Murray’s sale. With regard to 
it he wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker (November 23) : — 

“Your note has pleased me much — for I did not expect 
that you would have had time to read any of it Read the 
last chapter, and you will know the whole result, but without 
the evidence. The case, however, of radicles bending after 
exposure for an hour to geotropism, with their tips (or brains) 
cut off is, I think, worth your reading (bottom of p. 525) ; it 
astounded me. The next most remarkable fact, as it ap- 
peared to me (p. 148), is the discrimination of the tip of the 
radicle between a slightly harder and softer object affixed 
on opposite sides of tip. But I will bother you no more 
about my book. The sensitiveness of seedlings to light is 
marvellous.” 

To another friend, Mr. Thiselton Dyer, he wrote (Novem- 
ber 28, 1880) : — 

“Very many thanks for your most kind note, but you 
think too highly of our work, not but what this is very 
pleasant .... Many of the Germans are very contemp- 
tuous about making out the use of organs ; but they may 
sneer the souls out of their bodies, and I for one shall think 
it the most interesting part of Natural History. Indeed you 
are greatly mistaken if you doubt for one moment on the very 
great value of your constant and most kind assistance to us." 

The book was widely reviewed, and excited much interest 
among the general public. The following letter refers to a 
leading article in the Times, November 20, 1880:]

letter has done more than please me, for its kindness has 
touched my heart. I often think of old days and of the 
delight of my visits to Woodhouse, and of the deep debt of 
gratitude which I owe to your father. It was very good of 
you to write. I had quite forgotten my old ambition about 
the Shrewsbury newspaper ; * but I remember the pride 
which I felt when I saw in a book about beetles the impressive 
words “ captured by C. Darwin.” Captured sounded so grand 
compared with caught. This seemed to me glory enough for 
any man ! I do not know in the least what made the Times 
glorify me,t for it has sometimes pitched into me ferociously. 

I should very much like to see you again, but you would 
find a visit here very dull, for we feel very old and have no 
amusement, and lead a solitary life. But we intend in a few 
weeks to spend a few days in London, and then if you have 
anything else to do in London, you would perhaps come and 
lunch with us.$ 

Believe me, my dear Sarah, 

Yours gratefully and affectionately, 

Charles Darwin.

‘POWER OF MOVEMENT 



[1881. 



C. Darwin to Julius Wiesner. 

Down, October 25th, 1881. 

My DEAR SIR, — I have now finished your book,* and have 
understood the whole except a very few passages. In the 
first place, let me thank you cordially for the manner in which 
you have everywhere treated me. You have shown how a 
man may differ from another in the most decided manner, 
and yet express his difference with the most perfect courtesy. 
Not a few English and German naturalists might learn a 
useful lesson from your example; for the coarse language 
often used by scientific men towards each other does no good, 
and only degrades science. 

I have been profoundly interested by your book, and some 
of your experiments are so beautiful, that I actually felt 
pleasure while being vivisected. It would take up too much 
space to discuss all the important topics in your book. I fear 
that you have quite upset the interpretation which I have 
given of the effects of cutting off the tips of horizontally 
extended roots, and of those laterally exposed to moisture ; 
but I cannot persuade myself that the horizontal position of 
lateral branches and roots is due simply to their lessened 
power of growth. Nor when I think of my experiments with 
the cotyledons of Phalaris, can I give up the belief of the 
transmission of some stimulus due to light from the upper 
to the lower part At p. 60 you have misunderstood my 
meaning, when you say that I believe that the effects from 
light are transmitted to a part which is not itself heliotropic 
I never considered whether or not the short part beneath the 
ground was heliotropic ; but I believe that with young seed- 
lings the part which bends near, but above the ground is 
heliotropic, and I believe so from this part bending only 
moderately when the light is oblique, and bending rectan- 
gularly when the light is horizontal. Nevertheless the bending

l88l.] 

of this lower part, as I conclude from my experiments with 
opaque caps, is influenced by the action of light on the upper 
part. My opinion, however, on the above and many other 
points, signifies very little, for I have no doubt that your book 
will convince most botanists that I am wrong in all the points 
on which we differ. 

Independently of the question of transmission, my mind is 
so full of facts leading me to believe that light, gravity, &c., 
act not in a direct manner on growth, but as stimuli, that I 
am quite unable to modify my judgment on this head. I 
could not understand the passage at p. 78, until I consulted 
my son George, who is a mathematician. He supposes that 
your objection is founded on the diffused light from the lamp 
illuminating both sides of the object, and not being reduced, 
with increasing distance in the same ratio as the direct light ; 
but he doubts whether this necessary correction will account 
for the very little difference in the heliotropic curvature of the 
plants in the successive pots. 

With respect to the sensitiveness of the tips of roots to 
contact, I cannot admit your view until it is proved that I am 
in error about bits of card attached by liquid gum causing 
movement ; whereas no movement was caused if the card 
remained separated from the tip by a layer of the liquid gum. 
The fact also of thicker and thinner bits of card attached on 
opposite sides of the same root by shellac, causing movement 
in one direction, has to be explained. You often speak of the 
tip having been injured ; but externally there was no sign of 
injury : and when the tip was plainly injured, the extreme 
part became curved towards the injured side. I can no more 
believe that the tip was injured by the bits of card, at least 
when attached by gum-water, than that the glands of Drosera 
are injured by a particle of thread or hair placed on it, or that 
the human tongue is so when it feels any such object 

About the most important subject in my book, namely 
circumnutation, I can only say that I feel utterly bewildered

at the difference in our conclusions ; but I could not fully 
understand some parts which my son Francis will be able to 
translate to me when he returns home. The greater part of 
your book is beautifully clear. 

Finally, I wish that I had enough strength and spirit to 
commence a fresh set of experiments, and publish the results, 
with a full recantation of my errors when convinced of them ; 
but I am too old for such an undertaking, nor do I suppose 
that I shall be able to do much, or any more, original work. 
I imagine that I see one possible source of error in your 
beautiful experiment of a plant rotating and exposed to a 
lateral light. 

With high respect and with sincere thanks for the kind 
manner in which you have treated me and my mistakes, I 
remain. 

My dear Sir, yours sincerely, 

Charles Darwin.

CHAPTER XII. 

MISCELLANEOUS BOTANICAL LETTERS. 

I873-I882. 

[The present chapter contains a series of miscellaneous 
letters on botanical subjects. Some of them show my father’s 
varied interests in botanical science, and others give account 
of researches which never reached completioa] 

BLOOM ON LEAVES AND FRUIT. 

[His researches into the meaning of the “ bloom,” or waxy 
coating found on many leaves, was one of those inquiries 
which remained unfinished at the time of his death. He 
amassed a quantity of notes on the subject, part of which I 
hope to publish at no distant date.* 

One of his earliest letters on this subject was addressed in 
August, 1873, to Sir Joseph Hooker: — 

“ I want a little information from you, and if you do not 
yourself know, please to enquire of some of the wise men of 
Kew. 

"Why are the leaves and fruit of so many plants protected 
by a thin layer of waxy matter (like the common cabbage), 

* A small instalment, on the lished results identical with some 
relation between bloom and the which my father and myself ob- 
distribution of the stomata on tained, via. that bloom diminishes 
leaves, has appeared in the ‘Jour- transpiration. The same fact was 
nal of the Linnean Society,’ 1886. previously published by Garreau, 
Tschirsch ( Linnaa , 1881) has pub- in 1850.

or with fine hair, so that when such leaves or fruit are immersed 
in water they appear as if encased in thin glass ? It is really 
a pretty sight to put a pod of the common pea, or a raspberry 
into water. I find several leaves are thus protected on the 
under surface and not on the upper. 

“ How can water injure the leaves if indeed this is at all 
the case ? ” 

On this latter point he wrote to Sir Thomas Farrer 

“ I am now become mad about drops of water injuring 
leaves. Please ask Mr. Paine * whether he believes, from his 
own experience, that drops of water injure leaves or fruit in his 
conservatories. It is said that the drops act as burning-glasses ; 
if this is true, they would not be at all injurious on cloudy 
days. As he is so acute a man, I should very much like to 
hear his opinion. I remember when I grew hot-house orchids 
I was cautioned not to wet their leaves ; but I never then 
thought on the subject. 

“ I enjoyed my visit greatly with you, and I am very sure 
that all England could not afford a kinder and pleasanter 
host” 

Some years later he took up the subject again, and wrote to 
Sir Joseph Hooker (May 25, 1877): — 

" I have been looking over my old notes about the “bloom” 
on plants, and I think that the subject is well worth pursuing, 
though I am very doubtful of any success. Are you inclined 
to aid me on the mere chance of success, for without your aid 
I could do hardly anything ? ”] 

C. Darwin to Asa Gray.

“ bloom,” or the waxy secretion on the leaves and fruit of 
plants, but am very doubtful whether I shall succeed. Can

you give me any light ? Are such plants commoner in warm 
than in colder climates ? I ask because I often walk out in 
heavy rain, and the leaves of very few wild dicotyledons can 
be here seen with drops of water rolling off them like quick- 
silver. Whereas in my flower garden, greenhouse, and hot- 
houses there are several. Again, are bloom-protected plants 
common on your dry western plains ? Hooker thinks that they 
are common at the Cape of Good Hope. It is a puzzle to me 
if they are common under very dry climates, and I find bloom 
very common on the Acacias and Eucalypti of Australia. 
Some of the Eucalypti which do not appear to be covered with 
bloom have the epidermis protected by a layer of some 
substance which is dissolved in boiling alcohol. Are there 
any bloom-protected leaves or fruit in the Arctic regions? 
If you can illuminate me, as you so often have done, pray do 
so ; but otherwise do not bother yourself by answering. 

Yours affectionately, 

C. Darwin. 

C. Darwin to W. Thiselton Dyer. 

Down, September 5 [1877]. 

My dear Dyer, — One word to thank you. I declare had 
it not been for your kindness, we should have broken down. 
As it is we have made out clearly that with some plants (chiefly 
succulent) the bloom checks evaporation — with some certainly 
prevents attacks of insects ; with some sea-shore plants 
prevents injury from salt-water, and, I believe, with a few 
prevents injury from pure water resting on the leaves. This 
latter is as yet the most doubtful and the most interesting 
point in relation to the movements of plants.

C. Darwin to F. Miiller. 

Down, July 4 [1881]. 

My dear Sir, — Y our kindness is unbounded, and I cannot 
tell you how much your last letter (May 31) has interested 
me. I have piles of notes about the effect of water resting on 
leaves, and their movements (as I supposed) to shake off the 
drops. But I have not looked over these notes for a long 
time, and had come to think that perhaps my notion was mere 
fancy, but I had intended to begin experimenting as soon as 
I returned home ; and now with your invaluable letter about 
the position of the leaves of various plants during rain (I have 
one analogous case with Acacia from South Africa), I shall 
be stimulated to work in earnest. 

Variability. 

[The following letter refers to a subject on which my father 
felt the strongest interest the experimental investigation of 
the causes of variability. The experiments alluded to were 
to some extent planned out, and some preliminary work was 
begun in the direction indicated below, but the research was 
ultimately abandoned.]

vary, and no experiments as yet tried have thrown any light 
on the subject Now for the last ten years I have been 
experimenting in crossing and self-fertilising plants ; and one 
indirect result has surprised me much ; namely, that by taking 
pains to cultivate plants in pots under glass during several 
successive generations, under nearly similar conditions, and by 
self-fertilising them in each generation, the colour of the 
flowers often changes, and, what is very remarkable, they 
became in some of the most variable species, such as Mimulus, 
Carnation, &c., quite constant, like those of a wild species. 

This fact and several others have led me to the suspicion 
that the cause of variation must be in different substances 
absorbed from the soil by these plants when their powers of 
absorption are not interfered with by other plants with which 
they grow mingled in a state of nature. Therefore my son 
and I wish to grow plants in pots in soil entirely, or as nearly 
entirely as is possible, destitute of all matter which plants 
absorb, and then to give during several successive generations 
to several plants of the same species as different solutions as 
may be compatible with their life and health. And now, can 
you advise me how to make soil approximately free of all the 
substances which plants naturally absorb ? I suppose white 
silver sand, sold for cleaning harness, &c., is nearly pure silica, 
but what am I to do for alumina ? Without some alumina I 
imagine that it would be impossible to keep the soil damp 
and fit for the growth of plants. I presume that clay washed 
over and over again in water would still yield mineral matter 
to the carbonic acid secreted by the roots. I should want a 
good deal of soil, for it would be useless to experimentise 
unless we could fill from twenty to thirty moderately sized 
flower-pots every year. Can you suggest any plan ? for unless 
you can it would, I fear, be useless for us to commence an 
attempt to discover whether variability depends at all on 
matter absorbed from the soil. After obtaining the requisite 
kind of soil, my notion is to water one set of plants with

nitrate of potassium, another set with nitrate of sodium, and 
another with nitrate of lime, giving all as much phosphate of 
ammonia as they seemed to support, for I wish the plants to 
grow as luxuriantly as possible. The plants watered with 
nitrate of Na and of Ca would require, I suppose, some K ; but 
perhaps they would get what is absolutely necessary from such 
soil as I should be forced to employ, and from the rain-water 
collected in tanks. I could use hard water from a deep well 
in the chalk, but then all the plants would get lime. If the 
plants to which I give Nitrate of Na and of Ca would not 
grow I might give them a little alum. 

I am well aware how very ignorant I am, and how crude 
my notions are ; and if you could suggest any other solutions 
by which plants would be likely to be affected it would be a 
very great kindness. I suppose that there are no organic 
fluids which plants would absorb, and which I could procure? 

I must trust to your kindness to excuse me for troubling 
you at such length, and, 

I remain, dear Sir, yours sincerely, 

Charles Darwin.

subject :]

My dear Professor Semper, — I have been much 
pleased to receive your letter, but I did not expect you to

you attributed too much weight to the direct action of the

environment ; but whether I said so I know not, for without 
being asked I should have thought it presumptuous to have 
criticised your book, nor should I now say so had I not during 
the last few days been struck with Professor Hoffmann’s 
review of his own work in the ‘ Botanische Zcitung,’ on the 
variability of plants ; and it is really surprising how little effect 
he produced by cultivating certain plants under unnatural 
conditions, as the presence of salt, lime, zinc, &c., &c., during 
several generations. Plants, moreover, were selected which 
were the most likely to vary under such conditions, judging 
from the existence of closely-allied forms adapted for these 
conditions. No doubt I originally attributed too little weight 
to the direct action of conditions, but Hoffmann’s paper has 
staggered me. Perhaps hundreds of generations of exposure 
are necessary. It is a most perplexing subject I wish 
I was not so old, and had more strength, for I see lines 
of research to follow. Hoffmann even doubts whether 
plants vary more under cultivation than in their native home 
and under their natural conditions. If so, the astonishing 
variations of almost all cultivated plants must be due to 
selection and breeding from the varying individuals. This 
idea crossed my mind many years ago, but I was afraid to 
publish it, as I thought that people would say, “ how he does 
exaggerate the importance of selection.” 

I still must believe that changed conditions give the impulse 
to variability, but that they act in most cases in a very 
indirect manner. But, as I said, it is a most perplexing pro- 
blem. Pray forgive me for writing at such length ; I had no 
intention of doing so when I sat down to write. 

I am extremely sorry to hear, for your own sake and for 
that of Science, that you are so hard worked, and that so much 
of your time is consumed in official labour. 

Pray believe me, dear Professor Semper, 

Yours sincerely, 
Charles Darwin.

Galls. 

[Shortly before his death, my father began to experimentise 
on the possibility of producing galls artificially. A letter to 
Sir J. D. Hooker (Nov. 3, 1880) shows the interest which he 
felt in the question 

“ I was delighted with Paget’s Essay ; * I hear that he has 
occasionally attended to this subject from his youth .... 
I am very glad he has called attention to galls : this has 
always seemed to me a profoundly interesting subject ; and if 
I had been younger would take it up.” 

His interest in this subject was connected with his ever- 
present wish to learn something of the causes of variation. 
He imagined to himself wonderful galls caused to appear on 
the ovaries of plants, and by these means he thought it possible 
that the seed might be influenced, and thus new varieties 
arise. He made a considerable number of experiments by 
injecting various reagents into the tissues of leaves, and with 
some slight indications of success.] 

Aggregation. 

[The following letter gives an idea of the subject of the 
last of his published papers.f The appearances which he 
observed in leaves and roots attracted him, on account of 
their relation to the phenomena of aggregation which had so 
deeply interested him when he was at work on Drosera :]

chemical knowledge about plants, and I am so poor, that I 
appeal to your charity as a pauper. My question is — Do 
you know of any solid substance in the cells of plants which 
glycerine and water dissolves ? But you will understand my 
perplexity better if I give you the facts : I mentioned to you 
that if a plant of Euphorbia peplus is gently dug up and the 
roots placed for a short time in a weak solution (i to 10,000 
of water suffices in 24 hours) of carbonate of ammonia the 
(generally) alternate longitudinal rows of cells in every 
rootlet, from the root-cap up to the very top of the root (but 
not as far as I have yet seen in the green stem) become 
filled with translucent, brownish grains of matter. These 
rounded grains often cohere and even become confluent. 
Pure phosphate and nitrate of ammonia produce (though more 
slowly) the same effect, as does pure carbonate of soda. 

Now, if slices of root under a cover-glass are irrigated 
with glycerine and water, every one of the innumerable 
grains in the cells disappear after some hours. What am I 
to think of this \ . 

Forgive me for bothering you to 'such an extent ; but I 
must mention that if the roots are dipped in boiling water 
there is no deposition of matter, and carbonate of ammonia 
afterwards produces no effect I should state that I now find 
that the granular matter is formed in the cells immediately 
beneath the thin epidermis, and a few other cells near the 
vascular tissue. If the granules consisted of living protoplasm 
(but I can see no traces of movement in them), then I should 
infer that the glycerine killed them and aggregation ceased 
with the diffusion of invisibly minute particles, for I have 
seen an analogous phenomenon in Drosera. 

If you can aid me, pray do so, and anyhow forgive me. 

Yours very sincerely, 

Ch. Darwin.

Mr. Torbitt’s Experiments on the Potato-Disease. 



[Mr. James Torbitt, of Belfast, has been engaged for the 
last twelve years in the difficult undertaking, in which he has 
been to a large extent successful, of raising fungus-proof 
varieties of the potato. My father felt great interest in Mr. 
Torbitt’s work, and corresponded with him from 1876 on- 
wards. The following letter, giving a clear account of Mr. 
Torbitt’s method and of my father’s opinion of the probability 
of its success, was written with the idea that Government 
aid for the work might possibly be obtainable :] 



C. Darwin to T. H. Farrer. 

Down, March 2, 1878. 

My DEAR Farrer, — Mr. Torbitt’s plan of overcoming the 
potato-disease seems to me by far the best which has ever 
been suggested. It consists, as you know from his printed 
letter, of rearing a vast number of seedlings from cross-fertil- 
ised parents, exposing them to infection, ruthlessly destroying 
all that suffer, saving those which resist best, and repeating 
the process in successive seminal generations. My belief in 
the probability of good results from this process rests on the 
fact of all characters whatever occasionally varying. It is 
known, for instance, that certain species and varieties of the 
vine resist phylloxera better than others. Andrew Knight 
found one variety or species of the apple which was not in 
the least attacked by coccus, and another variety has been 
observed in South Australia. Certain varieties of the peach 
resist mildew, and several other such cases could be given. 
Therefore there is no great improbability in a new variety of 
potato arising which would resist the fungus completely, or 
at least much better than any existing variety. With respect 
to the cross-fertilisation of two distinct seedling plants, it has 
been ascertained that the offspring thus raised inherit much

more vigorous constitutions and generally are more prolific 
than seedlings from self-fertilised parents. It is also probable 
that cross-fertilisation would be especially valuable in the 
case of the potato, as there is reason to believe that the 
flowers are seldom crossed by our native insects ; and some 
varieties are absolutely sterile unless fertilised with pollen 
from a distinct variety. There is some evidence that the good 
effects from a cross are transmitted for several generations ; 
it would not, therefore be necessary to cross-fertilise the 
seedlings in each generation, though this would be desirable, 
as it is almost certain that a greater number of seeds would 
thus be obtained. It should be remembered that a cross 
between plants raised from the tubers of the same plant, 
though growing on distinct roots, does no more good than a 
cross between flowers on the same individual. Considering 
the whole subject, it appears to me that it would be a national 
misfortune if the cross-fertilised seeds in Mr. Torbitt’s posses- 
sion produced by parents which have already shown some 
power of resisting the disease, are not utilised by the Govern- 
ment, or some public body, and the process of selection 
continued during several more generations. 

Should the Agricultural Society undertake the work, Mr. 
Torbitt’s knowledge gained by experience would be especially 
valuable ; and an outline of the plan is given in his printed 
letter. It would be necessary that all the tubers produced by 
each plant should be collected separately, and carefully 
examined in each succeeding generation. 

It would be advisable that some kind of potato eminently 
liable to the disease should be planted in considerable numbers 
near the seedlings so as to infect them. 

Altogether the trial would be one requiring much care and 
extreme patience, as I know from experience with analogous 
work, and it may be feared that it would be difficult to find 
any one who would pursue the experiment with sufficient 
energy. It seems, therefore, to me highly desirable that

Mr. Torbitt should be aided with some small grant so as to 
continue the work himself. 

Judging from his reports, his efforts have already been 
crowned in so short a time with more success than could 
have been anticipated ; and I think you will agree with me, 
that any one who raises a fungus-proof potato will be a public 
benefactor of no common kind. 

My dear Farrer, yours sincerely, 

Charles Darwin. 

[After further consultation with Sir Thomas Farrer and 
with Mr. Caird, my father became convinced that it was 
hopeless to attempt to obtain Government aid. He wrote to 
Mr. Torbitt to this effect, adding, “it would be less trouble to 
get up a subscription from a few rich leading agriculturists 
than from Government This plan I think you cannot object 
to, as you have asked nothing, and will have nothing whatever 
to do with the subscription. In fact, the affair is, in my 
opinion, a compliment to you.” The idea thus broached was 
carried out, and Mr. Torbitt was enabled to continue his work 
by the aid of a sum to which Sir T. Farrer, Mr. Caird, my 
father, and a few friends, subscribed. 

My father’s sympathy and encouragement were highly 
valued by Mr. Torbitt, who tells me that without them he 
should long ago have given up his attempt A few extracts 
will illustrate his fellow-feeling with Mr. Torbitt’s energy and 
perseverance : — 

“ I admire your indomitable spirit If any one ever 
deserved success, you do so, and I keep to my original 
opinion that you have a very good chance of raising a fungus- 
proof variety of the potato. 

“A pioneer in a new undertaking is sure to meet with 
many disappointments, so I hope that you will keep up your 
courage, though we have done so very little for you.”

Mr. Torbitt tells me that he still (1887) succeeds in raising 
varieties possessing well-marked powers of resisting disease ; 
but this immunity is not permanent, and, after some years, the 
varieties become liable to the attacks of the fungus.] 



The Kew Index of Plant-Names, or ‘ Nomenclator 
Botanicus Darwinianus’. 

[Some account of my father’s connection with the Index of 
Plant-names now (1887) in course of preparation at Kew will 
be found in Mr. B. Daydon Jackson’s paper in the ‘Journal of 
Botany,’ 1887, p. 1 5 1. Mr. Jackson quotes the following state- 
ment by Sir J. D. Hooker : — 

"Shortly before his death, Mr. Charles Darwin informed 
Sir Joseph Hooker that it was his intention to devote 
a considerable sum of money annually for some years in 
aid or furtherance of some work or works of practical 
utility to biological science, and to make provisions in his 
will in the event of these not being completed during his 
lifetime. 

“ Amongst other objects connected with botanical science, 
Mr. Darwin regarded with especial interest the importance of 
a complete index to the names and authors of the genera and 
species of plants known to botanists, together with their 
native countries. Steudel’s * Nomenclator ’ is the only existing 
work of this nature, and although now nearly half a century 
old, Mr. Darwin had found it of great aid in his own re- 
searches. It has been indispensable to every botanical insti- 
tution, whether as a list of all known flowering plants, as an 
indication of their authors, or as a digest of botanical 
geography." 

Since 1840, when the ‘Nomenclator’ was published, the 
number of described plants may be said to have doubled, so 



352

[1881-2. 



that the ‘ Nomenclator’ is now seriously below the require- 
ments of botanical work. To remedy this want, the ‘ Nomen- 
clator ’ has been from time to time posted up in an inter- 
leaved copy in the Herbarium at Kew, by the help of “ funds 
supplied by private liberality.” * 

My father, like other botanists, had as Sir Joseph Hooker 
points out, experienced the value of Steudel’s work. He 
obtained plants from all sorts of sources, which were often 
incorrectly named, and he felt the necessity of adhering to 
the accepted nomenclature, so that he might convey to other 
workers precise indications as to the plants which he had 
studied. It was also frequently a matter of importance to 
him to know the native country of his experimental plants. 
Thus it was natural that he should recognize the desirability of 
completing and publishing the interleaved volume at Kew. 
The wish to help in this object was heightened by the admira- 
tion he felt for the results for which the world has to thank 
the Royal Gardens at Kew, and by his gratitude for the in- 
valuable aid which for so many years he received from its 
Director and his staff. He expressly stated that it was his 
wish “ to aid in some way the scientific work carried on at 
the Royal Gardens ” f — which induced him to offer to supply 
funds for the completion of the Kew ‘ Nomenclator.’ 

The following passage, for which I am indebted to Pro- 
fessor Judd, is of interest, as illustrating the motives that 
actuated my father in this matter. Professor Judd writes 
“ On the occasion of my last visit to him, he told me that 
his income having recently greatly increased, while his wants 
remained the same, he was most anxious to devote what he 
could spare to the advancement of Geology or Biology. He 
dwelt in the most touching manner on the fact that he owed 
so much happiness and fame to the natural-history sciences

which had been the solace of what might have been a painful 
existence ; — and he begged me, if I knew of any research 
which could be aided by a grant of a few hundreds of pounds, 
to let him know, as it would be a delight to him to feel that 
he was helping in promoting the progress of science. He 
informed me at the same time that he was making the same 
suggestion to Sir Joseph Hooker and Professor Huxley with 
respect to Botany and Zoology respectively. I was much 
impressed by the earnestness, and, indeed, deep emotion, with 
which he spoke of his indebtedness to Science, and his desire 
to promote its interests.” 

Sir Joseph Hooker was asked by my father “ to take into 
consideration, with the aid of the botanical staff at Kew and 
the late Mr. Bentham, the extent and scope of the proposed 
work, and to suggest the best means of having it executed. 
In doing this, Sir Joseph had further the advantage of the 
great knowledge and experience of Professor Asa Gray, of 
Cambridge, U.S.A., and of Mr. John Ball, F.R.S.”* 

The plan of the proposed work having been carefully 
considered, Sir Joseph Hooker was able to confide its elabo- 
ration in detail to Mr. B. Daydon Jackson, Secretary of the 
Linnean Society, whose extensive knowledge of botanical 
literature qualifies him for the task. My father’s original idea 
of producing a modem edition of Steudel's ‘ Nomenclator’ 
has been practically abandoned, the aim now kept in view is 
rather to construct a list of genera and species (with references) 
founded on Bentham and Hooker’s ‘ Genera Plantarum.’ The 
colossal nature of the work in progress at Kew may be esti- 
mated by the fact that the manuscript of the ‘ Index ’ is at 
the present time (1887) believed to weigh 'more than a ton. 
Under Sir Joseph Hooker’s supervision the work goes steadily 
forward, being carried out with admirable zeal by Mr. Jackson, 
who devotes himself unsparingly to the enterprise, in which,

too, he has the advantage of the interest in the work felt by 
Professor Oliver and Mr. Thiselton Dyer. 

The Kew ‘ Index,’ which will, in all probability, be ready 
to go to press in four or five years, will be a fitting memorial 
of my father : and his share in its completion illustrates a 
part of his character — his ready sympathy with work outside 
his own lines of investigation — and his respect for minute 
and patient labour in all branches of science.] 



( 355 ) 



CHAPTER XIII. 

CONCLUSION. 

SOME idea of the general course of my father’s health may 
have been gathered from the letters given in the preceding 
pages. The subject of health appears more prominently 
than is often necessary in a Biography, because it was, 
unfortunately, so real an element in determining the outward 
form of his life. 

During the last ten years of his life the state of his health 
was a cause of satisfaction and hope to his family. His con- 
dition showed signs of amendment in several particulars. 
He suffered less distress and discomfort, and was able to 
work more steadily. Something has been already said of 
Dr. Bence Jones’s treatment, from which my father certainly 
derived benefit. In later years he became a patient of 
Sir Andrew Clark, under whose care he improved greatly 
in general health. It was not only for his generously ren- 
dered service that my father felt a debt of gratitude towards 
Sir Andrew Clark. He owed to his cheering personal 
influence an often-repeated encouragement, which latterly 
added something real to his happiness, and he found sincere 
pleasure in Sir Andrew’s friendship and kindness towards 
himself and his children. 

Scattered through the past pages are one or two references 
to pain or uneasiness felt in the region of the heart. How 
far these indicate that the heart was affected early in life, 
I cannot pretend to say ; in any case it is certain that he 
had no serious or permanent trouble of this nature until 
2 A 2

356 CONCLUSION. [l88l. 

shortly before his death. In spite of the general improve- 
ment in his health, which has been above alluded to, there 
was a certain loss of physical vigour occasionally apparent 
during the last few years of his life. This is illustrated by 
a sentence in a letter to his old friend Sir James Sulivan, 
written on January 10, 1879: “My scientific work tires me 
more than it used to do, but I have nothing else to do, and 
whether one is worn out a year or two sooner or later signi- 
fies but little.” 

A similar feeling is shown in a letter to Sir J. D. Hooker 
of June 15, 1881. My father was staying at Patterdale, and 
wrote : “I am rather despondent about myself .... I have 
not the heart or strength to begin any investigation lasting 
years, which is the only thing which I enjoy, and I have no 
little jobs which I can do.” 

In July, 1881, he wrote to Mr. Wallace, “We have just 
returned home after spending five weeks on Ullswater ; the 
scenery is quite charming, but I cannot walk, and everything 
tires me, even seeing scenery .... What I shall do with my 
few remaining years of life I can hardly tell. I have every- 
thing to make me happy and contented, but life has become 
very wearisome to me.” He was, however, able to do a good 
deal of work, and that of a trying sort,* during the autumn 
of 1881, but towards the end of the year he was clearly in 
need of rest ; and during the winter was in a lower condition 
than was usual with him. 

On December 13, he went for a week to his daughter's 
house in Bryanston Street. During his stay in London he 
went to call on Mr. Romanes, and was seized when on the 
door-step with an attack apparently of the same kind as those 
which afterwards became so frequent. The rest of the in- 
cident, which I give in Mr. Romanes’ words, is interesting too 
from a different point of view, as giving one more illustration 
of my father’s scrupulous consideration for others : — 

* On the action of carbonate of ammonia on roots and leaves.

1882.] 

“ I happened to be out, but my butler, observing that Mr. 
Darwin was ill, asked him to come in. He said he would 
prefer going home, and although the butler urged him to 
wait at least until a cab could be fetched, he said he would 
rather not give so much trouble. For the same reason he 
refused to allow the butler to accompany him. Accordingly 
he watched him walking with difficulty towards the direction 
in which cabs were to be met with, and saw that, when he 
had got about three hundred yards from the house, he stag- 
gered and caught hold of the park-railings as if to prevent 
himself from falling. The butler therefore hastened to his 
assistance, but after a few seconds saw him turn round with 
the evident purpose of retracing his steps to my house. How- 
ever, after he had returned part of the way he seems to 
have felt better, for he again changed his mind, and proceeded 
to find a cab.” 

During the last week of February and in the. beginning of 
March, attacks of pain in the region of the heart, with irre- 
gularity of the pulse, became frequent, coming on indeed 
nearly every afternoon. A seizure of this sort occurred about 
March 7, when he was walking alone at a short distance from 
the house ; he got home with difficulty, and this was the 
last time that he was able to reach his favourite ‘Sand- 
walk.’ Shortly after this, his illness became obviously more 
serious and alarming, and he was seen by Sir Andrew Clark, 
whose treatment was continued by Dr. Norman Moore, of St 
Bartholomew’s Hospital, and Mr. Allfrey, of St. Mary Cray. 
He suffered from distressing sensations of exhaustion and 
faintness, and seemed to recognise with deep depression the 
fact that his working days were over. He gradually recovered 
from this condition, and became more cheerful and hopeful, as 
is shown in the following letter to Mr. Huxley, who was 
anxious that my father should have closer medical supervision 
than the existing arrangements allowed : —

CONCLUSION. 



[1882. 

Down, March 27, 1882. 

“ My DEAR Huxley, — Your most kind letter has been a real 
cordial to me. I have felt better to-day than for three weeks, 
and have felt as yet no pain. Your plan seems an excellent 
one, and I will probably act upon it, unless I get very much 
better. Dr. Clark’s kindness is unbounded to me, but he is 
too busy to come here. Once again, accept my cordial 
thanks, my dear old friend. I wish to God there were more 
automata * in the world like you. 

Ever yours, 

Ch. Darwin." 

The allusion to Sir Andrew Clark requires a word of ex- 
planation. Sir Andrew Clark himself was ever ready to 
devote himself to my father, who, however, could not endure 
the thought of sending for him, knowing how severely his 
great practice taxed his strength. 

No especial change occurred during the beginning of April, 
but on Saturday 15th he was seized with giddiness while 
sitting at dinner in the evening, and fainted in an attempt to 
reach his sofa. On the 17th he was again better, and in my 
temporary absence recorded for me the progress of an ex- 
periment in which I was engaged. During the night of April 
1 8th, about a quarter to twelve, he had a severe attack and 
passed into a faint, from which he was brought back to 
consciousness with great difficulty. He seemed to recognise 
the approach of death, and said, “ I am not the least afraid 
to die.” All the next morning he suffered from terrible 
nausea and faintness, and hardly rallied before the end 
came. 

He died at about four o’clock on Wednesday, April 19th, 
1882. 

* The allusion is to Mr. Huxley’s tory,” given at the Belfast Meeting 
address, “On the hypothesis that of the British Association, 1874, and 
animals are automata, and its his- republished in ‘Science and Culture.’

I close the record of my father's life with a few words of 
retrospect added to the manuscript of his ‘Autobiography 

“ As for myself, I believe that I have acted rightly in steadily 
following and devoting my life to Science. I feel no remorse 
from having committed any great sin, but have o ten an 
often regretted that I have not done more direct good to my 
fellow creatures.”

House of Commons, April 25, 1882. 

My dear Darwin, — I quite sympathise with your feeling, and 
personally I should greatly have preferred that your father should 
have rested in Down amongst us alL It is, I am sure, quite under- 
stood that the initiative was not taken by you. Still, from a national 
point of view, it is dearly right that he should be buried in the Abbey. 
I esteem it a great privilege to be allowed to accompany my dear 
master to the grave. 



W. E. Darwin, Esq. 



Believe me, yours most sincerely, 

John Lubbock. 



The family gave up their first-formed plans, and the funeral took 
place in Westminster Abbey on April 26th. The pall-bearers 
were : —
