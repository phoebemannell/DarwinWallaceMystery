<tr><td>CHAPTER I. </td></tr>
<tr><td>THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE ���ORIGIN OF SPECIES.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>[In the first volume, p. 82, the growth of the ��� Origin of Species ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>has been briefly described in my father���s words. The letters </td></tr>
<tr><td>given in the present and following chapters will illustrate and </td></tr>
<tr><td>amplify the history thus sketched out. </td></tr>
<tr><td>It is clear that, in the early part of the voyage of the Beagle </td></tr>
<tr><td>he did not feel it inconsistent with his views to express him- </td></tr>
<tr><td>self in thoroughly orthodox language as to the genesis of new </td></tr>
<tr><td>species. Thus in 1834 he wrote* at Valparaiso: ���I have </td></tr>
<tr><td>already found beds of recent shells yet retaining their colour </td></tr>
<tr><td>at an elevation of 1300 feet, and beneath the level country is </td></tr>
<tr><td>strewn with them. It seems not a very improbable conjecture </td></tr>
<tr><td>that the want of animals may be owing to none having been </td></tr>
<tr><td>created since this country was raised from the sea.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>This pcissage does not occur in the published ���Journal,��� the </td></tr>
<tr><td>last proof of which was finished in 1837 ; and this fact har- </td></tr>
<tr><td>monizes with the change we know to have been proceeding in </td></tr>
<tr><td>his views. But in the published ���Journal ��� we find passages </td></tr>
<tr><td>which show a point of view more in accordance with orthodox </td></tr>
<tr><td>* MS. Journals, p. 468. </td></tr>
<tr><td>VOL. II. B </td></tr>
<tr><td>2 THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE ���ORIGIN OF SPECIES.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>theological natural history than with his later views. Thus, </td></tr>
<tr><td>in speaking of the birds Synallaxis and Scytalopus (ist edit </td></tr>
<tr><td>p. 3S3 ; 2nd edit p. 289), he says: ���When finding, as in </td></tr>
<tr><td>this case, any animal which seems to play so insignificant </td></tr>
<tr><td>a part in the great scheme of nature, one is apt to wonder </td></tr>
<tr><td>why a distinct species should have been created.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>A comparison of the two editions of the ���Journal��� is in- </td></tr>
<tr><td>structive, as giving some idea of the development of his </td></tr>
<tr><td>views on evolution. It does not give us a true index of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the mass of conjecture which was taking shape in his mind, </td></tr>
<tr><td>but it shows us that he felt sure enough of the truth of his </td></tr>
<tr><td>belief to allow a stronger tinge of evolution to appear in </td></tr>
<tr><td>the second edition. He has mentioned in the Autobiography </td></tr>
<tr><td>(p. 83), that it was not until he read Malthus that he got a </td></tr>
<tr><td>clear view of the potency of natural selection. This was in </td></tr>
<tr><td>1838 ��� a year after he finished the first edition (it was not </td></tr>
<tr><td>published until 1839), and seven years before the second edition </td></tr>
<tr><td>was written (1845). Thus the turning-point in the formation </td></tr>
<tr><td>of his theory took place between the writing of the two </td></tr>
<tr><td>editions. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I will first give a few passages which are practically the </td></tr>
<tr><td>same in the two editions, and which are, therefore, chiefly of </td></tr>
<tr><td>interest as illustrating his frame of mind in 1837. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The case of the two species of Molothrus (ist edit. p. 61 ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>2nd edit p. S 3 ) must have been one of the earliest instances </td></tr>
<tr><td>noticed by him of the existence of representative species ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>a phenomenon which we know (���Autobiography,��� p. 83) struck </td></tr>
<tr><td>him deeply. The discussion on introduced animals (ist edit </td></tr>
<tr><td>p. 139; 2nd edit p. l2o) shows how much he was impressed </td></tr>
<tr><td>by the complicated interdependence of the inhabitants of a </td></tr>
<tr><td>An analogous point of view is given in the discussion </td></tr>
<tr><td>(1st edit p. 98 ; 2nd edit p. 85) of the mistaken belief that </td></tr>
<tr><td>large animals require, for their support, a luxuriant vegeta- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tion ; the incorrectness of this view is illustrated by the com- </td></tr>
<tr><td>THE ���NATURALIST���S VOYAGE.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>parison of the fauna of South Africa and South America, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>the vegetation of the two continents. The interest of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>discussion is that it shows clearly our i priori ignorance of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the conditions of life suitable to any organism. </td></tr>
<tr><td>There is a passage which has been more than once quoted </td></tr>
<tr><td>as bearing on the origin of his views. It is where he dis�� </td></tr>
<tr><td>cusses the striking difference between the species of mice on </td></tr>
<tr><td>the east and west of the Andes (ist edit p. 399) : ��� Unless we </td></tr>
<tr><td>suppose the same species to have been created in two </td></tr>
<tr><td>different countries, we ought not to expect any closer simi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>larity between the organic beings on the opposite sides of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the Andes than on shores separated by a broad strait of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>sea.��� In the 2nd edit p. 327, the passage is almost verbally </td></tr>
<tr><td>identical, and is practically the same. </td></tr>
<tr><td>There are other passages again which are more strongly </td></tr>
<tr><td>evolutionary in the 2nd edit, but otherwise are similar to the </td></tr>
<tr><td>corresponding passages in the 1st edition. Thus, in describing </td></tr>
<tr><td>the blind Tuco-tuco (ist edit. p. 60 ; 2nd edit. p. 52), in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>first edition he makes no allusion to what Lamarck might </td></tr>
<tr><td>have thought, nor is the instance used as an example of </td></tr>
<tr><td>modification, as in the edition of 1845. </td></tr>
<tr><td>A striking passage occurs in the 2nd edit (p. 173) on the </td></tr>
<tr><td>relationship between the ���extinct edentata and the living </td></tr>
<tr><td>sloths, ant-eaters, and armadillos.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� This wonderful relationship in the same continent between </td></tr>
<tr><td>the dead and the living, will, I do not doubt, hereafter throw </td></tr>
<tr><td>more light on the appearance of organic beings on our earth, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and their disappearance from it, than any other class of facts.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>This sentence does not occur in the 1st edit, but he was </td></tr>
<tr><td>evidently profoundly struck by the disappearance of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>gigantic forerunners of the present animals. The difference </td></tr>
<tr><td>between the discussions in the two editions is most instructive. </td></tr>
<tr><td>In both, our ignorance of the conditions of life is insisted on, </td></tr>
<tr><td>but in the second edition, the discussion is made to lead up to </td></tr>
<tr><td>a strong statement of the intensity of the struggle for life. </td></tr>

<tr><td>4 THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE ���ORIGIN OF SPECIES.' </td></tr>
<tr><td>Then follows a comparison behveen rarity ��� and extinction, </td></tr>
<tr><td>which introduces the idea that the preservation and dominance </td></tr>
<tr><td>of existing species depend on the degree in which they are </td></tr>
<tr><td>adapted to surrounding conditions. In the first edition, he is </td></tr>
<tr><td>merely ��� tempted to believe in such simple relations as varia- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tion of climate and food, or introduction of enemies, or the </td></tr>
<tr><td>increased number of other species, as the .cause of the succes- </td></tr>
<tr><td>sion of races.��� But finally (1st edit.) he ends the chapter by </td></tr>
<tr><td>comparing the extinction of a species to the exhaustion and </td></tr>
<tr><td>disappearance of varieties of fruit-trees, as though he thought </td></tr>
<tr><td>that a mysterious term of life was impressed on each species </td></tr>
<tr><td>at its creation. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The difference of treatment of the Galapagos problem is of </td></tr>
<tr><td>some interest In the earlier book, the American type of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>productions of the islands is noticed, as is the fact that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>different islands possess forms specially their own, but the </td></tr>
<tr><td>importance of the whole problem is not so strongly put </td></tr>
<tr><td>forward. Thus, in the first edition, he merely says : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>"This similarity of type between distant islands and con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tinents, while the species are distinct, has scarcely been </td></tr>
<tr><td>sufficiently noticed. The circumstance would be explained, </td></tr>
<tr><td>according to the views of some authors, by saying that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>creative power had acted according to the same law over a </td></tr>
<tr><td>wide area.��� ��� (ist edit. p. 474.) </td></tr>
<tr><td>This passage is not given in the second edition, and the </td></tr>
<tr><td>generalisations on geographical distribution are much wider </td></tr>
<tr><td>and fuller. Thus he asks : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>" Why were their aboriginal inhabitants, associated ... in </td></tr>
<tr><td>different proportions both in kind and number from those </td></tr>
<tr><td>on the Continent, and therefore acting on each other in a </td></tr>
<tr><td>different manner ��� why were they created on American types </td></tr>
<tr><td>of organisation ?��� ��� (2nd edit. p. 393-) </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� In the second edition, p. 146, of our ignorance of the causes of </td></tr>

<tr><td>chapter. Thus the gradation in the form of beak presented </td></tr>
<tr><td>by the thirteen allied species of finch is described in the first </td></tr>
<tr><td>edition (p. 461) without comment. Whereas in the second </td></tr>
<tr><td>edition (p. 380) he concludes : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� One might really fancy that from an original paucity of </td></tr>

<tr><td>On the whole it seems to me remarkable that the difference </td></tr>
<tr><td>between the two editions is not greater ; it is another proof of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the author���s caution and self-restraint in the treatment of his </td></tr>
<tr><td>theory. After reading the second edition of the ��� Journal,��� we </td></tr>
<tr><td>find with a strong sense of surprise how far developed were </td></tr>
<tr><td>his views in 1837. We are enabled to form an opinion on </td></tr>
<tr><td>this point from the note-books in which he wrote down </td></tr>
<tr><td>detached thoughts and queries. I shall quote from the first </td></tr>
<tr><td>note-book, completed between July 1837 and February </td></tr>
<tr><td>1 838 : and this is the more worth doing, as it gives us an </td></tr>
<tr><td>insight into the condition of his thoughts before the reading </td></tr>
<tr><td>of Malthus. The notes are written in his most hurried style, </td></tr>
<tr><td>so many words being omitted, that it is often difficult to </td></tr>
<tr><td>arrive at the meaning. With a few exceptions (indicated by </td></tr>
<tr><td>square brackets)* I have printed the extracts as written ; the </td></tr>
<tr><td>punctuation, however, has been altered, and a few obvious </td></tr>
<tr><td>slips corrected where it seemed necessary. The extracts arc </td></tr>
<tr><td>not printed in order, but are roughly classified.f </td></tr>

<tr><td>The two following extracts show that he applied the theory </td></tr>
<tr><td>of evolution to the "whole organic kingdom��� from plants to </td></tr>

<tr><td>yet from some common progenitor. Now if the intermediate </td></tr>
<tr><td>ranks had produced infinite species, probably the scries would </td></tr>
<tr><td>have been more perfect.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>At another place, speaking of intermediate forms, he says </td></tr>
<tr><td>" Cuvier objects to propagation of species by saying, why </td></tr>
<tr><td>have not some intermediate forms been discovered between </td></tr>
<tr><td>Palaeotherium, Megalonyx, Mastodon, and the species now </td></tr>
<tr><td>living ? Now according to my view (in S. America) parent of </td></tr>

<tr><td>��� Opponents will say ��� show them me. I will answer yes, if </td></tr>
<tr><td>you will show me every step between bulldog and grey- </td></tr>
<tr><td>hound.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>Here we see that the case of domestic animals was already </td></tr>
<tr><td>present in his mind as bearing on the production of natural </td></tr>
<tr><td>species. The disappearance of intermediate forms naturally </td></tr>
<tr><td>leads up to the subject of extinction, with which the next </td></tr>
<tr><td>extract begins. </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� It is a wonderful fact, horse, elephant, and mastodon, </td></tr>
<tr><td>dying out about same time in such different quarters. </td></tr>
<tr><td>���Will Mr. Lyell say that some [same?] circumstance killed </td></tr>

<tr><td>3. generation of species like generation of individuals. </td></tr>
<tr><td>���Why does individual die.��� To perpetuate certain peculi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>arities (therefore adaptation), and obliterate accidental varieties, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and to accommodate itself to change (for, of course, change, </td></tr>
<tr><td>even in varieties, is accommodation). Now this argument </td></tr>
<tr><td>applies to species. </td></tr>

<tr><td>sooner or later. Prove animals like plants ��� trace gradation </td></tr>
<tr><td>between associated and non-associated animals ��� and the story </td></tr>

<tr><td>Here we have the view already alluded to of a term of life </td></tr>

<tr><td>unfavourable variation, and thus a hint is given of natural </td></tr>
<tr><td>selection : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� With respect to extinction, we can easily see that [a] </td></tr>
<tr><td>variety of [the] ostrich (Petise), may not be well adapted, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and thus perish out ; or, on the other hand, like Orpheus [a </td></tr>
<tr><td>Galapagos bird], being favourable, many might be produced. </td></tr>
<tr><td>This requires [the] principle that the permanent variations </td></tr>
<tr><td>produced by confined breeding and changing circumstances </td></tr>
<tr><td>arc continued and produce[d] according io the adaptation of </td></tr>
<tr><td>such circumstances, and therefore that death of species is a </td></tr>
<tr><td>consequence (contrary to what would appear from America) </td></tr>
<tr><td>of non-adaptation of circumstances.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>The first part of the next extract has a similar bearing. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The end of the passage is of much interest, as showing that </td></tr>
<tr><td>he had at this early date visions of the far-reaching character </td></tr>
<tr><td>of his speculations : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� With belief of transmutation and geographical grouping, </td></tr>
<tr><td>we are led to endeavour to discover causes of change ; the </td></tr>

<tr><td>View of generation being condensation,* test of highest or- </td></tr>

<tr><td>i-BOOK OF 1837. </td></tr>
<tr><td>second is especially interesting, as it contains the germ of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the concluding sentence of the ��� Origin of Species ��� : * ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� Before the attraction of gravity discovered it might have </td></tr>
<tr><td>been said it was as great a difficulty to account for the </td></tr>
<tr><td>movement of all [planets] by one law, as to account for each </td></tr>
<tr><td>separate one ; so to say that all mammalia were born from </td></tr>
<tr><td>one stock, and since distributed by such means as we can </td></tr>
<tr><td>recognise, may be thought to explain nothing. </td></tr>
<tr><td>���Astronomers might formerly have said that God fore- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ordered each planet to move in its particular destiny. In the </td></tr>
<tr><td>same manner God orders each animal created with certain </td></tr>
<tr><td>forms in certain countries ; but how much more simple and </td></tr>
<tr><td>sublime [a] power ��� let attraction act according to certain </td></tr>
<tr><td>law, such arc inevitable consequences ��� let animals be created, </td></tr>
<tr><td>then by the fixed laws of generation, such will be their </td></tr>

<tr><td>forms of one country to another ��� let geological changes go at </td></tr>
<tr><td>such a rate, so will be the number and distribution of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>species ! ! ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>The three next extracts are of miscellaneous interest : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>" When one sees nipple on man���s breast, one does not say </td></tr>
<tr><td>some use, but sex not having been determined ��� so with useless </td></tr>
<tr><td>wings under elytra of beetles ��� born from beetles with wings, </td></tr>

<tr><td>��� In a decreasing population at any one moment fewer </td></tr>

<tr><td>The last extract which I shall quote gives the germ of his </td></tr>
<tr><td>theory of the relation between alpine plants in various parts </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the world, in the publication of which he was forestalled </td></tr>
<tr><td>by E. Forbes (see Vol. I. p. 88). He says, in the 1837 note- </td></tr>

<tr><td>[they are] species of lower genera altered, or northern plants.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>When we turn to the Sketch of his theory, written in 1844 </td></tr>
<tr><td>(still therefore before the second edition of the ���Journal��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>was completed), we find an enormous advance made on the </td></tr>
<tr><td>note-book of 1837. The Sketch is in fact a surprisingly com- </td></tr>
<tr><td>plete presentation of the argument afterwards familiar to us </td></tr>
<tr><td>in the ��� Origin of Species.��� There is some obscurity as to the </td></tr>
<tr><td>date of the short Sketch which formed the basis of the 1844 </td></tr>
<tr><td>Essay. We know from his own words (Vol. I. p. 184), that it </td></tr>
<tr><td>was in June 1842 that he first wrote out a short sketch of </td></tr>
<tr><td>his views.* This statement is given with so much circum- </td></tr>
<tr><td>stance that it is almost Impossible to suppose that it contains </td></tr>
<tr><td>an error of date. It agrees also with the followng extract </td></tr>
<tr><td>from his Diary. </td></tr>

<tr><td>of Species to form Varieties,��� * the essay of 1844 (extracts </td></tr>
<tr><td>from which form part of the paper) is said to have been </td></tr>
<tr><td>���sketched in 1839, and copied in 1844.��� This statement is </td></tr>
<tr><td>obviously made on the authority of a note written in my </td></tr>
<tr><td>father���s hand across the Table of Contents of the 1844 Essay. </td></tr>
<tr><td>It is to the following effect : ���This was sketched in 1839, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>copied out in full, as here written and read by you in 1844.��� </td></tr>

<tr><td>was sent to Sir J. D. Hooker (see Letter of June 29, 1858, </td></tr>
<tr><td>Vol. II. p. 1 19). There is also some further evidence on this side </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the question. Writing to Mr. Wallace (Jan. 25, 1859) my </td></tr>
<tr><td>father says : ��� ��� Every one whom I have seen has thought </td></tr>
<tr><td>your paper very well written and interesting. It puts my </td></tr>
<tr><td>extracts (written in 1839, now just twenty years ago !), which </td></tr>
<tr><td>I must say in apology were never for an instant intended for </td></tr>
<tr><td>publication, into the shade.��� The statement that the earliest </td></tr>
<tr><td>sketch was written in 1839 has been frequently made in </td></tr>
<tr><td>biographical notices of my father, no doubt on the authority </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the ��� Linnean Journal,��� but it must, I think, be considered </td></tr>
<tr><td>as erroneous. The error may possibly have arisen in this </td></tr>
<tr><td>way. In writing on the Table of Contents of the 1844 MS. </td></tr>
<tr><td>that it was sketched in 1839, I think my father may have </td></tr>
<tr><td>intended to imply that the framework of the theory was clearly </td></tr>
<tr><td>thought out by him at that date. In the Autobiography </td></tr>
<tr><td>(p. 88) he speaks of the time, ��� about 1839, when the theory </td></tr>
<tr><td>was clearly conceived,��� meaning, no doubt, the end of 1838 </td></tr>
<tr><td>and beginning of 1839, when the reading of Malthus had </td></tr>
<tr><td>given him the key to the idea of natural selection. But this </td></tr>
<tr><td>explanation does not apply to the letter to Mr. Wallace ; and </td></tr>

<tr><td>the variation of Organic Beings under Domestication and in </td></tr>
<tr><td>their Natural State.��� II. ���On the Evidence favourable and </td></tr>
<tr><td>opposed to the view that Species are naturally formed races </td></tr>

<tr><td>main argument of the ��� Origin of Species.��� It is founded, as is </td></tr>
<tr><td>the argument of that work, on the study of domestic animals, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and both the Sketch and the ��� Origin ��� open with a chapter </td></tr>
<tr><td>on variation under domestication and on artificial selection. </td></tr>
<tr><td>This is followed, in both essays, by discussions on variation </td></tr>
<tr><td>under nature, on natural selection, and on the struggle for </td></tr>
<tr><td>life. Here, any close resemblance between the two essays </td></tr>
<tr><td>with regard to arrangement ceases. Chapter III. of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>Sketch, which concludes the first part, treats of the varia- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tions which occur in the instincts and habits of animals, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and thus corresponds to some extent with Chapter VII. of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the ���Origin��� (ist edit.). It thus forms a complement to </td></tr>
<tr><td>the chapters which deal with variation in structure. It seems </td></tr>
<tr><td>to have been placed thus early in the Essay to prevent the </td></tr>
<tr><td>hasty rejection of the whole theory by a reader to whom </td></tr>
<tr><td>the idea of natural selection acting on instincts might seem </td></tr>
<tr><td>impossible. This is the more probable, as the Chapter on </td></tr>
<tr><td>Instinct in the ��� Origin ��� is specially mentioned (Introduction, </td></tr>
<tr><td>p. 5) as one of the ��� most apparent and gravest difficulties on </td></tr>
<tr><td>the theory.��� Moreover the chapter in the Sketch ends with </td></tr>
<tr><td>a discussion, ���whether any particular corporeal structures </td></tr>
<tr><td>are so wonderful as to justify the rejection //-��>��(} facie </td></tr>
<tr><td>of our theory.��� Under this heading comes the discussion of </td></tr>

<tr><td>letter to Dr. Asa Gray, November nth, 1859: ���I cannot </td></tr>
<tr><td>possibly believe that a false theory would explain so many </td></tr>
<tr><td>classes of facts, as I think it certainly does explain. On these </td></tr>
<tr><td>grounds I drop my anchor, and believe that the difficulties </td></tr>
<tr><td>will slowly disappear.��� On this principle, having stated the </td></tr>
<tr><td>theory in the first part, he proceeds to show to what extent </td></tr>
<tr><td>various wide series of facts can be explained by its means. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Thus the second part of the Sketch corresponds roughly </td></tr>
<tr><td>to the nine concluding Chapters of the First Edition of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>���Origin.��� But we must exclude Chapter VII. (���Origin���) on </td></tr>
<tr><td>Instinct, which forms a chapter in the first part of the Sketch, </td></tr>

<tr><td>PRINCIPLE OF DIVERGENCE. </td></tr>
<tr><td>In the Autobiography (Vol. I. p. 84) my father has stated </td></tr>
<tr><td>what seemed to him the chief flaw of the 1844 Sketch; he </td></tr>
<tr><td>had overlooked ���one problem of great importance,��� the </td></tr>
<tr><td>problem of the divergence of character. This point is dis- </td></tr>
<tr><td>cussed in the ��� Origin of Species,��� but, as it may not be familiar </td></tr>
<tr><td>to all readers, I will give a short account of the difficulty and </td></tr>
<tr><td>its solution. The author begins by stating that varieties </td></tr>
<tr><td>differ from each other less than species, and then goes on : </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� Nevertheless, according to my view, varieties are species in </td></tr>
<tr><td>process of formation How then does the lesser dif- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ference between varieties become augmented into the greater </td></tr>
<tr><td>difference between species.��� * He shows how an analogous </td></tr>
<tr><td>divergence takes place under domestication where an originally </td></tr>
<tr><td>uniform stock of horses has been split up into race-horses, </td></tr>
<tr><td>dray-horses, &c., and then goes on to explain how the same </td></tr>
<tr><td>principle applies to natural species. ���From the simple </td></tr>
<tr><td>circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from </td></tr>
<tr><td>any one species become in structure, constitution, and habits, </td></tr>
<tr><td>by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and </td></tr>
<tr><td>widely diversified places in the polity of nature, and so be </td></tr>
<tr><td>enabled to increase in numbers.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>The principle is exemplified by the fact that if on one plot </td></tr>
<tr><td>of ground a single variety of wheat be sown, and on to </td></tr>
<tr><td>another a mixture of varieties, in the latter case the produce </td></tr>
<tr><td>is greater. More individuals have been able to exist because </td></tr>
<tr><td>they were not all of the same variety. An organism becomes </td></tr>
<tr><td>more perfect and more fitted to survive when by division </td></tr>
<tr><td>of labour the different functions of life are performed by </td></tr>
<tr><td>different organs. In the same way a species becomes more </td></tr>
<tr><td>efficient and more able to survive when different sections of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the species become differentiated so as to fiil different stations. </td></tr>
<tr><td>In reading the Sketch of 1844, I have found it difficult to </td></tr>
<tr><td>recognise, as a flaw in the Essay, the absence of any definite </td></tr>
<tr><td>statement of the principle of divergence. Descent with </td></tr>

<tr><td>do not notice the absence of proof that divergence is in itself </td></tr>
<tr><td>an advantage. As shown in the Autobiography, my father </td></tr>
<tr><td>in 1876 found it hardly credible that he should have over- </td></tr>

<tr><td>from having read various proof-sheets of his then unpublished </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� Journal.��� These had been submitted to Mr. (afterwards Sir. </td></tr>

<tr><td>Ch. Lyell, Esq., of Kinnordy, who (being a very old friend of </td></tr>

<tr><td>to examine Webb and Berthelot on the Canary Islands for </td></tr>
<tr><td>this object. Talking with Mr. Bentham, he told me that the </td></tr>

<tr><td>dissimilar ; and it has occurred to me that possibly part of </td></tr>

<tr><td>world, the individual species have wider ranges, thus the Owl </td></tr>
<tr><td>is mundane, and many of the species have very wide ranges. </td></tr>
<tr><td>So I believe it is with land and fresh-water shells ��� and I </td></tr>
<tr><td>might adduce other cases. Is it not so with Cryptogamic </td></tr>
<tr><td>plants ; have not most of the species wide ranges, in those </td></tr>
<tr><td>genera which are mundane ? I do not suppose that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>converse holds, viz. ��� that when a species has a wide range, </td></tr>
<tr><td>its genus also ranges wide. Will you so far oblige me by </td></tr>
<tr><td>occasionally thinking over this? It would cost me vast </td></tr>
<tr><td>trouble to get a list of mundane phanerogamic genera and </td></tr>
<tr><td>26 GROWTH OF THE ���ORIGIN.��� [1844. </td></tr>
<tr><td>then search how far the species of these genera are apt to </td></tr>

<tr><td>though perhaps the point may long since have occurred to </td></tr>

<tr><td>, . . The conclusion, which I have come at is, that those </td></tr>
<tr><td>areas, in which species are most numerous, have oftenest </td></tr>
<tr><td>been divided and isolated from other areas, united and again </td></tr>
<tr><td>divided ; a process implying antiquity and some changes in </td></tr>

<tr><td>general conclusion, which the geographical distribution of all </td></tr>
<tr><td>organic beings, appears to me to indicate, is that isolation is </td></tr>
<tr><td>the chief .concomitant or cause of the appearance of 7iew </td></tr>
<tr><td>forms (I well know there are some staring exceptions). </td></tr>
<tr><td>Secondly, from seeing how often the plants and animals </td></tr>
<tr><td>swarm in a country, when introduced into it, and from see- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ing what] a vast number of plants will live, for instance in </td></tr>
<tr><td>England, if kept free from weeds, and native plants, I have </td></tr>

<tr><td>features, than on the number of forms, which have been there </td></tr>
<tr><td>originally created or produced. I much doubt whether you </td></tr>
<tr><td>will find it possible to explain the number of forms by pro- </td></tr>
<tr><td>portional differences of exposure ; and I cannot doubt if </td></tr>
<tr><td>half the species in any country were destroyed or had not </td></tr>
<tr><td>been created, yet that country would appear to us fully </td></tr>
<tr><td>peopled. With respect to original creation or production of </td></tr>

<tr><td>ment. Hence, with respect to terrestrial productions, a tract </td></tr>
<tr><td>of country, which had oftenest within the late geological pe- </td></tr>
<tr><td>riods subsided and been converted into islands, and reunited, </td></tr>

<tr><td>As you say you would like to hear my reasons for being </td></tr>
<tr><td>most unwilling to believe in the continental extensions of late </td></tr>
<tr><td>authors, I gladly write them, as, without 1 am convinced of </td></tr>
<tr><td>my error, I shall have to give them condensed in my essay, </td></tr>
<tr><td>when I discuss single and multiple creation ; I shall therefore </td></tr>
<tr><td>be particularly glad to have your general opinion on them, </td></tr>
<tr><td>I may quite likely have persuaded myself in my wrath that </td></tr>

<tr><td>reason to admit a continental extension in any one or two </td></tr>
<tr><td>instances (as in Madeira) than in other cases, I should feel no- </td></tr>
<tr><td>difficulty whatever. But if on account of European plants, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and littoral sea shells, it is thought necessary to join Madeira </td></tr>
<tr><td>to the mainland. Hooker is quite right to join New Holland </td></tr>
<tr><td>to New Zealand, and Auckland Island (and Raoul Island to </td></tr>
<tr><td>N.E.), and these to S. America and the Falklands, and these </td></tr>
<tr><td>to Tristan d���Acunha, and these to Kerguelen Land ; thus </td></tr>
<tr><td>making, either strictly at the same time, or at different periods, </td></tr>
<tr><td>but all within the life of recent beings, an almost circumpolar </td></tr>
<tr><td>belt of land. So again Galapagos and Juan Fernandez must </td></tr>
<tr><td>be joined to America ; and if we trust to littoral sea shells, the </td></tr>
<tr><td>Galapagos must have been joined to the Pacific Islands (2400 </td></tr>
<tr><td>miles distant) as well as to America, and as Woodward seems </td></tr>
<tr><td>to think all the islands in the Pacific into a magnificent con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tinent ; also the islands in the Southern Indian Ocean into </td></tr>
<tr><td>another continent, with Madagascar and Africa, and perhaps. </td></tr>

<tr><td>1856.] </td></tr>
<tr><td>CONTINENTAL EXTENSION. </td></tr>
<tr><td>7S- </td></tr>
<tr><td>across the ocean to the Azores, and further north right across. </td></tr>
<tr><td>In short, we must suppose probably, half the present ocean </td></tr>
<tr><td>was land within the period of living organisms. The Globe </td></tr>
<tr><td>within this period must have had a quite different aspect. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Now the only way to test this, that I can see, is to consider </td></tr>
<tr><td>whether the continents have undergone within this same pe- </td></tr>
<tr><td>riod such wonderful permutations. In all North and South </td></tr>
<tr><td>and Central America, we have both recent and miocene (or </td></tr>
<tr><td>eocene) shells, quite distinct on the opposite sides, and hence </td></tr>
<tr><td>I cannot doubt that fundamentally America has held its place </td></tr>
<tr><td>since at least, the miocene period. In Africa almost all the </td></tr>
<tr><td>living shells are distinct on the opposite sides of the inter- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tropical regions, short as the distance is compared to the range </td></tr>
<tr><td>of marine mollusca, in uninterrupted seas ; hence I infer that </td></tr>
<tr><td>Africa has e.xisted since our present species were created. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Even the isthmus of Suez and the Aralo-Caspian basin have </td></tr>
<tr><td>had a great antiquity. So I imagine, from the tertiary depos- </td></tr>
<tr><td>its, has India. In Australia the great fauna of extinct mar- </td></tr>
<tr><td>supials shows that before the present mammals appeared, </td></tr>
<tr><td>Australia was a separate continent. I do not for one second </td></tr>
<tr><td>doubt that very large portions of all these continents have </td></tr>
<tr><td>undergone great changes of level within this period, but yet I </td></tr>
<tr><td>conclude that fundamentally they stood as barriers in the sea, </td></tr>
<tr><td>where they now stand ; and therefore I should require the </td></tr>
<tr><td>weightiest evidence to make me believe in such immense </td></tr>
<tr><td>changes within the period of living organisms in our oceans, </td></tr>
<tr><td>where, moreover, from the great depths, the changes must </td></tr>
<tr><td>have been vaster in a vertical sense. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Secondly. Submerge our present continents, leaving a few </td></tr>
<tr><td>mountain peaks as islands, and what will the character of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>islands be ? ��� Consider that the Pyrenees, Sierra Nevada, </td></tr>
<tr><td>Apennines, Alps, Carpathians, are non-volcanic, Etna and </td></tr>
<tr><td>Caucasus, volcanic. In Asia, Altai and Himalaya, I believe </td></tr>

<tr><td>Mountains ��� some of the latter alone, I believe, volcanic. In </td></tr>
<tr><td>South America to the east, the non-volcanic [Silla] of Caracas, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and Itacolumi of Brazil, further south the Sierra jVentanas, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and in the Cordilleras, many volcanic but not all. Now </td></tr>

<tr><td>rock), and the Seychelles, if this latter can be called oceanic, </td></tr>
<tr><td>in the line of Madagascar ; the Falklands, only 500 miles off, </td></tr>
<tr><td>are only a shallow bank ; New Caledonia, hardly oceanic, is </td></tr>
<tr><td>another exception. This argument has to me great weight </td></tr>
<tr><td>Compare on a Geographical Map, islands which, we have </td></tr>

<tr><td>Sardinia, and how different it appears. Believing, as I am </td></tr>
<tr><td>inclined, that continents as continents, and oceans as oceans, </td></tr>
<tr><td>are. of immense antiquity ��� I should say that if any of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>existing oceanic islands have any relation of any kind to </td></tr>
<tr><td>continents, they are forming continents ; and that by the </td></tr>
<tr><td>time they could form a continent, the volcanoes would be </td></tr>
<tr><td>denuded to their cores, leaving peaks of syenite, diorite, or </td></tr>
<tr><td>porphyry. But have we nowhere any last wreck of a con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tinent, in the midst of the ocean ? St. Paul���s Rock, and such </td></tr>
<tr><td>old battered volcanic islands, as St. Helena, may be ; but </td></tr>
<tr><td>I think we can see some reason why we should have less </td></tr>
<tr><td>evidence of sinking than of rising continents (if my view in </td></tr>
<tr><td>my Coral volume has any truth in it, viz. : that volcanic </td></tr>
<tr><td>outbursts accompany rising areas), for during subsidence </td></tr>
<tr><td>there will be no compensating agent at work, in rising areas </td></tr>

<tr><td>Thirdly. Considering the depth of the ocean, I was, before I </td></tr>
<tr><td>got your letter, inclined vehemently to dispute the vast </td></tr>
<tr><td>amount of subsidence, but I must strike my colours. With </td></tr>
<tr><td>respect to coral reefs, I carefully guarded against its being </td></tr>
<tr><td>1856.] CONTINENTAL EXTENSION. </td></tr>
<tr><td>supposed that a continent was indicated by the groups of </td></tr>
<tr><td>atolls. It is difficult to guess, as it seems to me, the </td></tr>
<tr><td>amount of subsidence indicated by coral reefs ; but in such </td></tr>
<tr><td>large areas as the Lowe Archipelago, the Marshall Archi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>pelago, and Laccadive group, it would, judging from the </td></tr>
<tr><td>heights of existing oceanic archipelagoes, be odd, if some </td></tr>
<tr><td>peaks of from 8000 to 10,000 feet had not been buried. Even </td></tr>
<tr><td>after your letter a suspicion crossed me whether it would bo </td></tr>
<tr><td>fair to argue from subsidences in the middle of the greatest </td></tr>
<tr><td>oceans to continents ; but refreshing my memory by talking </td></tr>
<tr><td>with Ramsay in regard to the probable thickness in one vertical </td></tr>
<tr><td>line of the Silurian and carboniferous formation, it seems there </td></tr>
<tr><td>must have been at least 10,000 feet of subsidence during these </td></tr>
<tr><td>formations in Europe and North America, and therefore </td></tr>
<tr><td>during the continuance of nearly the same set of organic </td></tr>
<tr><td>beings. But even 1 2,000 feet would not be enough for the </td></tr>
<tr><td>Azores, or for Hooker���s continent ; I believe Hooker does not </td></tr>
<tr><td>infer a continuous continent, but approximate groups of </td></tr>
<tr><td>islands, with, if we may judge from existing continents, not </td></tr>
<tr><td>profoundly deep sea between them ; but the argument from </td></tr>
<tr><td>the volcanic nature of nearly every existing oceanic island </td></tr>
<tr><td>tells against such supposed groups of islands, ��� for I presume </td></tr>
<tr><td>he does not suppose a mere chain of volcanic islands belting </td></tr>
<tr><td>the southern hemisphere. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Fourthly. The supposed continental extensions do not seem </td></tr>
<tr><td>to me, perfectly to account for all the phenomena of distri- </td></tr>
<tr><td>bution on islands ; as the absence of mammals and Batra- </td></tr>
<tr><td>chians ; the absence of certain great groups of insects on </td></tr>

<tr><td>the paucity of plants in some cases, &c. Not that those who </td></tr>
<tr><td>believe in various accidental means of dispersal, can explain </td></tr>
<tr><td>most of these cases ; but they may at least say that these </td></tr>

<tr><td>... It is not a little egotistical, but I should like to tell </td></tr>
<tr><td>you (and I do not think I have) how I view my work. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Nineteen years (!) ago it occurred to me that whilst otherwise </td></tr>
<tr><td>employed on Nat. Hist., I might perhaps do good if I noted </td></tr>
<tr><td>any sort of facts bearing on the question of the origin of </td></tr>
<tr><td>species, and this I have since been doing. Either species </td></tr>
<tr><td>have been independently created, or they have descended </td></tr>
<tr><td>from other species, like varieties from one species. I think it </td></tr>
<tr><td>can be shown to be probable that man gets his most distinct </td></tr>
<tr><td>varieties by preserving such as arise best worth keeping and </td></tr>
<tr><td>destroying the others, but I should fill a quire if I were to go </td></tr>
<tr><td>on. To be brief, I assume that species arise like our domestic </td></tr>
<tr><td>varieties with much extinction ; and then test this hypothesis </td></tr>
<tr><td>by comparison with as many general and pretty well-esta- </td></tr>
<tr><td>blished propositions as I can find made out, ��� in geographical </td></tr>
<tr><td>1856.] GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION. 79 </td></tr>
<tr><td>distribution, geological history, affinities, &c. &c. And it </td></tr>
<tr><td>seems to me that, supposing that such hypothesis were to </td></tr>
<tr><td>explain such general propositions, we ought, in accordance </td></tr>
<tr><td>with the common way of following all sciences, to admit it till </td></tr>
<tr><td>some better hypothesis be found out. For to my mind to </td></tr>
<tr><td>say that species were created so and so is no scientific explan- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ation, only a reverent way of saying it is so and so. But it </td></tr>
<tr><td>is nonsensical trying to show how I try to proceed, in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>compass of a note. But as an honest man, I must tell you that </td></tr>
<tr><td>I have come to the heterodox conclusion, that there are no </td></tr>
<tr><td>such things as independently created species ��� that species are </td></tr>
<tr><td>only strongly defined varieties. I know that this will make </td></tr>
<tr><td>you despise me. I do not much underrate the many huge </td></tr>
<tr><td>difficulties on this view, but yet it seems to me to explain too </td></tr>
<tr><td>much, otherwise inexplicable, to be false. Just to allude to </td></tr>
<tr><td>one point in your last note, viz. about species of the same </td></tr>
<tr><td>genus getierally having a common or continuous area ; if they </td></tr>
<tr><td>are actual lineal descendants of one species, this of course </td></tr>
<tr><td>would be the case ; and the sadly too many exceptions (for </td></tr>
<tr><td>me) have to be explained by climatal and geological changes. </td></tr>
<tr><td>A fortiori on this view (but on exactly same grounds), all the </td></tr>
<tr><td>individuals of the same species should have a continuous </td></tr>
<tr><td>distribution. On this latter branch of the subject I have put </td></tr>

<tr><td>much pleased to find that it seemed to have considerable </td></tr>
<tr><td>weight with Hooker, who said he had never been so much </td></tr>

<tr><td>separate question, but the conclusion which I have come to, </td></tr>
<tr><td>quite independently of geographical distribution, is that </td></tr>
<tr><td>e.xtemal conditions (to which naturalists so often appeal) do </td></tr>
<tr><td>by themselves very little. How much they do is the point of </td></tr>
<tr><td>all others on which I feel myself very weak. I judge from </td></tr>
<tr><td>the facts of variation under domestication, and I may yet get </td></tr>
<tr><td>more light. But at present, after drawing up a rough copy </td></tr>
<tr><td>on this subject, my conclusion is that external conditions do </td></tr>
<tr><td>extremely little, except in causing mere variability. This </td></tr>
<tr><td>mere variability (causing the child not closely to resemble its </td></tr>
<tr><td>parent) I look at as very different from the formation of a </td></tr>
<tr><td>marked variety or new species. (No doubt the variability is </td></tr>
<tr><td>governed by laws, some of which I am endeavouring very </td></tr>
<tr><td>obscurely to trace.) The formation of a strong variety or </td></tr>
<tr><td>species I look at as almost wholly due to the selection of </td></tr>
<tr><td>what may be incorrectly called variations or variability. </td></tr>
<tr><td>This power of selection stands in the most direct relation to </td></tr>
<tr><td>time, and in the state of nature can be only excessively slow. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Again, the slight differences selected, by which a race or </td></tr>
<tr><td>species is at last formed, stands, as I think can be shown </td></tr>
<tr><td>.(even with plants, and obviously with animals), in a far more </td></tr>
<tr><td>important relation to its associates than to external conditions. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Therefore, according to my principles, whether right or wrong, </td></tr>
<tr><td>I cannot agree with your proposition that time, and altered </td></tr>
<tr><td>conditions, and altered associates, are ��� convertible terms." I </td></tr>
<tr><td>look at the first and the last as far more important; time </td></tr>
<tr><td>being important only so far as giving scope to selection. </td></tr>

<tr><td>I shall have to discuss and think more about your difficulty of </td></tr>

<tr><td>(if my general principles are right), that there would be little </td></tr>

<tr><td>that I am, for so very few naturalists care for anything beyond </td></tr>

<tr><td>I thank you most truly for the kind spirit of your last letter. </td></tr>

<tr><td>With respect to the extent to which I go, all the arguments </td></tr>
<tr><td>in favour of my notions fall rapidly away, the greater the scope </td></tr>

<tr><td>perhaps, think it paltry in me, when I ask you not to mention </td></tr>
<tr><td>my doctrine ; the reason is, if any one, like the author of the </td></tr>

<tr><td>in, and then I should have to quote from a work perhaps </td></tr>
<tr><td>despised by naturalists, and this would greatly injure any </td></tr>
<tr><td>chance of my views being received by those alone whose </td></tr>
<tr><td>opinions I value. [Here follows a discussion on ���large </td></tr>
<tr><td>genera varying,��� which has no direct connection with the </td></tr>
<tr><td>remainder of the letter.] </td></tr>
<tr><td>I. It is wonderful what the principle of Selection by Man, </td></tr>
<tr><td>that is the picking out of individuals with any desired quality, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and breeding from them, and again picking out, can do. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Even breeders have been astonished at their own results. </td></tr>
<tr><td>They can act on differences inappreciable to an uneducated </td></tr>
<tr><td>eye. Selection has been metlwdically followed in Europe for </td></tr>
<tr><td>only the last half century. But it has occasionally, and even </td></tr>
<tr><td>in some degree methodically, been followed in the most </td></tr>
<tr><td>ancient times. There must have been also a kind of uncon- </td></tr>
<tr><td>scious selection from the most ancient times, namely, in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>preservation of the individual animals (without any thought of </td></tr>
<tr><td>their offspring) most useful to each race of man in his par- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ticular circumstances. The ��� roguing,��� as nursery-men call the </td></tr>
<tr><td>destroying of varieties, which depart from their type, is a kind </td></tr>
<tr><td>of selection. I am convinced that intentional and occasional </td></tr>
<tr><td>selection has been the main agent in making our domestic </td></tr>
<tr><td>races. But, however this may be, its great power of modifi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>cation has been indisputably shown in late times. Selection </td></tr>
<tr><td>acts only by the accumulation of very slight or greater </td></tr>
<tr><td>variations, caused by external conditions, or by the mere </td></tr>
<tr><td>fact that in generation the child is not absolutely similar to </td></tr>
<tr><td>its parent. Man, by this power of accumulating variations, </td></tr>
<tr><td>adapts living beings to his wants ��� he may be said to make </td></tr>

<tr><td>II. Now, suppose there was a being, who did not judge by- </td></tr>
<tr><td>mere external appearance, but could study the whole internal </td></tr>
<tr><td>organisation ��� who never was capricious ��� who should go on </td></tr>
<tr><td>selecting for one end during millions of generations, who will </td></tr>
<tr><td>say what he might not effect 1 In nature we have some slight </td></tr>
<tr><td>variations, occasionally in all parts ; and I think it can be </td></tr>
<tr><td>shown that a change in the conditions of existence is the </td></tr>
<tr><td>main cause of the child not exactly resembling its parents ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>and in nature, geology shows us what changes have taken </td></tr>
<tr><td>place, and are taking place. We have almost unlimited time ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>no one but a practical geologist can fully appreciate this : </td></tr>
<tr><td>think of the Glacial period, during the whole of which the </td></tr>
<tr><td>same species of shells at least have existed ; there must </td></tr>
<tr><td>have been during this period, millions on millions of </td></tr>
<tr><td>generations. </td></tr>
<tr><td>III. I think it can be shown that there is such an unerring </td></tr>
<tr><td>power at work, or Natural Selection (the title of my book), </td></tr>
<tr><td>which selects exclusively for the good of each organic being. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The elder De Candolle, W. Herbert, and Lyell, have written </td></tr>
<tr><td>strongly on the struggle for life; but even they have not </td></tr>
<tr><td>written strongly enough. Reflect that every being (even the </td></tr>
<tr><td>elephant) breeds at such a rate that, in a few years, or at most </td></tr>
<tr><td>a few centuries or thousands of years, the surface of the earth </td></tr>
<tr><td>would not hold the progeny of any one species. I have found </td></tr>
<tr><td>it hard constantly to bear in mind that the increase of every </td></tr>
<tr><td>single species is checked during some part of its life, or during </td></tr>
<tr><td>some shortly recurrent generation. Only a few of those </td></tr>
<tr><td>annually born can live to propagate their kind. What a </td></tr>
<tr><td>trifling difference must often determine which shall survive </td></tr>
<tr><td>and which perish 1 </td></tr>
<tr><td>IV. Now take the case of a country undergoing some </td></tr>
<tr><td>change ; this will tend to cause some of its inhabitants to vary </td></tr>
<tr><td>slightly ; not but what I believe most beings vary at all times </td></tr>
<tr><td>124 the writing of the ���origin of species.��� [1858. </td></tr>
<tr><td>enough for selection to act on. Some of its inhabitants will </td></tr>
<tr><td>be exterminated, and the remainder will be exposed to the </td></tr>
<tr><td>mutual action of a different set of inhabitants, which I believe </td></tr>
<tr><td>to be more important to the life of each being than mere </td></tr>
<tr><td>climate. Considering the infinitely various ways beings have </td></tr>
<tr><td>to obtain food by struggling with other beings, to escape </td></tr>
<tr><td>danger at various times of life, to have their eggs or seeds </td></tr>
<tr><td>disseminated, &c. &c., I cannot doubt that during millions of </td></tr>
<tr><td>generations individuals of a species will be born with some </td></tr>
<tr><td>slight variation profitable to some part of its economy ; such </td></tr>
<tr><td>will have a better chance of surviving, propagating this varia- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tion, which again will be slowly increased by the accumulative </td></tr>
<tr><td>action of natural selection ; and the variety thus formed will </td></tr>
<tr><td>either coexist with, or more commonly will exterminate its </td></tr>
<tr><td>parent form. An organic being like the woodpecker, or </td></tr>
<tr><td>the mistletoe, may thus come to be adapted to a score of </td></tr>
<tr><td>contingencies ; natural selection, accumulating those slight </td></tr>
<tr><td>variations in all parts of its structure which are in any way </td></tr>
<tr><td>useful to it, during any part of its life. </td></tr>
<tr><td>V. Multiform difficulties will occur to every one on this </td></tr>
<tr><td>theory. Most can, I think, be satisfactorily answered. ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>Natura non facit saltum ��� answer some of the most obvi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ous. The slowness of the change, and only a very few under- </td></tr>
<tr><td>going change at any one time answers others. The extreme </td></tr>
<tr><td>imperfections of our geological records answer others. </td></tr>
<tr><td>VI. One other principle, which maybe called the principle </td></tr>
<tr><td>of divergence, plays, I believe, an important part in the origin </td></tr>
<tr><td>of species. The same spot will support more life if occupied </td></tr>
<tr><td>by very diverse forms : we see this in the many generic forms </td></tr>
<tr><td>in a square yard of turf (I have counted twenty species </td></tr>
<tr><td>belonging to eighteen genera), or in the plants and insects, </td></tr>
<tr><td>on any little uniform islet, belonging to almost as many </td></tr>
<tr><td>genera and families as to species. We can understand this </td></tr>
<tr><td>with the higher animals, whose habits we best understand. </td></tr>
<tr><td>We know that it has been experimentally shown that a plot </td></tr>
<tr><td>1858.] THE LETTER TO DR. GRAY. 12$ </td></tr>
<tr><td>of land will yield a greater weight, if cropped with several </td></tr>
<tr><td>species of grasses, than with two or three species. Now every </td></tr>
<tr><td>single organic being, by propagating rapidly, may be said to </td></tr>
<tr><td>be striving its utmost to increase in numbers. So it will be </td></tr>
<tr><td>with the offspring of any species after it has broken into </td></tr>
<tr><td>varieties, or sub-species, or true species. And it follows, I </td></tr>
<tr><td>think, from the foregoing facts, that the varying offspring of </td></tr>
<tr><td>each species will try (only few will succeed) to seize on as </td></tr>
<tr><td>many and as diverse places in the economy of nature as </td></tr>
<tr><td>possible. Each new variety or species when formed will </td></tr>
<tr><td>generally take the place of, and so exterminate its less well- </td></tr>
<tr><td>fitted parent This, I believe, to be the origin of the classifi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>cation or arrangement of all organic beings at all times. </td></tr>
<tr><td>These always seem to branch and sub-branch like a tree </td></tr>
<tr><td>from a common trunk ; the flourishing twigs destroying the </td></tr>
<tr><td>less vigorous ��� the dead and lost branches rudely representing </td></tr>
<tr><td>extinct genera and families. </td></tr>
<tr><td>This sketch is most imperfect ; but in so short a space I </td></tr>
<tr><td>cannot make it better. Your imagination must fill up many </td></tr>
<tr><td>wide blanks. Without some reflection, it will appear all </td></tr>
<tr><td>rubbish ; perhaps it will appear so after reflection. </td></tr>
<tr><td>C. Darwin. </td></tr>
<tr><td>P.S. ��� This little abstract touches only the accumulative </td></tr>
<tr><td>power of natural selection, which I look at as by far the most </td></tr>
<tr><td>important element in the production of new forms. The laws </td></tr>
<tr><td>governing the incipient or primordial variation (unimportant </td></tr>
<tr><td>except as the groundwork for selection to act on, in which </td></tr>

<tr><td>My dear Gray, ��� Your note of July 27th has just reached </td></tr>
<tr><td>me in the Isle of Wight. It is a real and great pleasure to me </td></tr>
<tr><td>to write to you about my notions ; and even if it were not so, </td></tr>
<tr><td>I should be a most ungrateful dog, after all the invalu- </td></tr>
<tr><td>able assistance which you have rendered me, if I did not do </td></tr>
<tr><td>anything which you asked. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I have discussed in my long MS. the later changes of </td></tr>
<tr><td>climate and the effect on migration, and I will here give you </td></tr>
<tr><td>an abstract of an abstract (which latter I am preparing of </td></tr>
<tr><td>my whole work for the Linnean Society). I cannot give </td></tr>
<tr><td>you facts, and I must write dogmatically, though I do not </td></tr>
<tr><td>feel so on any point. I may just mention, in order that you </td></tr>
<tr><td>may believe that I have some foundation for my views, that </td></tr>
<tr><td>Hooker has read my MS., and though he at first demurred to </td></tr>
<tr><td>my main point, he has since told me that further reflection </td></tr>
<tr><td>and new facts have made him a convert. </td></tr>
<tr><td>In the older, or perhaps newer, Pliocene age (a little </td></tr>
<tr><td>before the Glacial epoch) the temperature was higher ; of </td></tr>
<tr><td>this there can be little doubt ; the land, on a large scale, </td></tr>
<tr><td>held much its present disposition ; the species were mainly, </td></tr>
<tr><td>judging from shells, what they are now. At this period </td></tr>
<tr><td>when all animals and plants ranged 10�� or 15�� nearer the </td></tr>
<tr><td>poles, I believe the northern part of Siberia and of North </td></tr>
<tr><td>America, being almost continuous, were peopled (it is quite </td></tr>
<tr><td>possible, considering the shallow water, that Behring Straits </td></tr>
<tr><td>were united, perhaps a little southward) by a nearly uniform </td></tr>
<tr><td>fauna and flora, just as the Arctic regions now are. The </td></tr>
<tr><td>climate then became gradually colder till it became what </td></tr>
<tr><td>it now is ; and then the temperate parts of Europe and </td></tr>
<tr><td>America would be separated, as far as migration is concerned, </td></tr>
<tr><td>just as they now are. Then came on the Glacial period, </td></tr>
<tr><td>driving far south all living things ; middle or even southern </td></tr>
<tr><td></td></tr>

<tr><td>Europe being peopled with Arctic productions ; as the warmth </td></tr>
<tr><td>returned, the Arctic productions slowly crawled up the moun- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tains as they became denuded of snow ; and we now see on </td></tr>
<tr><td>their summits the remnants of a once continuous flora and </td></tr>
<tr><td>fauna. This is E. Forbes���s theory, which, however, I may </td></tr>
<tr><td>add, I had written out four years before he published. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Some facts have made me vaguely suspect that between </td></tr>
<tr><td>the glacial and the present temperature there was a period </td></tr>
<tr><td>of slightly greater warmth. According to my modification- </td></tr>
<tr><td>doctrines, I look at many of the species of North America </td></tr>
<tr><td>which closely represent those of Europe, as having become </td></tr>
<tr><td>modified since the Pliocene period, when in the northern part </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the world there was nearly free communication between </td></tr>
<tr><td>the old and new worlds. But now comes a more important </td></tr>
<tr><td>consideration ; there is a considerable body of geological </td></tr>
<tr><td>evidence that during the Glacial epoch the whole world was </td></tr>
<tr><td>colder ; I inferred that, many years ago, from erratic boulder </td></tr>
<tr><td>phenomena carefully observed by me on both the east and </td></tr>
<tr><td>west coast of South America. Now I am so bold as to </td></tr>
<tr><td>believe that at the height of the Glacial epoch, and when all </td></tr>
<tr><td>Tropical productions must have been considerably distressed, </td></tr>
<tr><td>several temperate forms slowly travelled into the heart of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>Tropics, and even reached the southern hemisphere ; and some </td></tr>
<tr><td>few southern forms penetrated in a reverse direction north- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ward. (Heights of Borneo with Australian forms, Abyssinia </td></tr>
<tr><td>with Cape forms.) Wherever there was nearly continuous high </td></tr>
<tr><td>land, this migration would have been immensely facilitated ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>hence the European character of the plants of Tierra del Fuego </td></tr>
<tr><td>and summits of Cordilleras ; hence ditto on Himalaya. As the </td></tr>
<tr><td>temperature rose, all the temperate intruders would crawl up </td></tr>
<tr><td>the mountains. Hence the European forms on Nilgherries, </td></tr>
<tr><td>Ceylon, summit of Java, Organ Mountains of Brazil. But </td></tr>
<tr><td>these intruders being surrounded with new forms would be </td></tr>
<tr><td>very liable to be improved or modified by natural selection, </td></tr>
<tr><td>to adapt them to the new forms with which they had to </td></tr>

<tr><td>compete ; hence most of the forms on the mountains of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>Tropics are not identical, but representative forms of North </td></tr>
<tr><td>temperate plants. </td></tr>
<tr><td>There are similar classes of facts in marine productions. </td></tr>
<tr><td>All this will appear very rash to you, and rash it may be ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>but I am sure not so rash as it will at first appear to you : </td></tr>
<tr><td>Hooker could not stomach it at all at first, but has become </td></tr>
<tr><td>largely a convert. From mammalia and shallow sea, I believe </td></tr>

<tr><td>before, during, and after the Glacial epoch would act on </td></tr>

<tr><td>My dear Hooker, ��� Here is an odd, though very little, </td></tr>
<tr><td>fact. I think it would be hardly possible to name a bird </td></tr>
<tr><td>which apparently could have less to do with distribution than </td></tr>
<tr><td>a Petrel. Sir W. Milner, at St. Kilda, cut open some young </td></tr>
<tr><td>nestling Petrels, and he found large, curious nuts in their crops ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>I suspect picked up by parent birds from the Gulf stream. </td></tr>
<tr><td>He seems to value these nuts excessively. I have asked him </td></tr>
<tr><td>(but I doubt whether he will) to send a nut to Sir William </td></tr>
<tr><td>Hooker (I gave this address for grandeur���s sake) to see if any </td></tr>
<tr><td>of you can name it and its native country. Will you please </td></tr>
<tr><td>mention this to Sir William Hooker, and if the nut does ar- </td></tr>
<tr><td>rive, will you oblige me by returning it to ���Sir W. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Milner, Bart., Nunappleton, Tadcaster,��� in a registered </td></tr>
<tr><td>letter, and I will repay you postage. Enclose slip of paper </td></tr>
<tr><td>with the name and country if you can, and let me hereafter </td></tr>
<tr><td>know. Forgive me asking you to take this much trouble ; for </td></tr>
<tr><td>it is a funny little fact after my own heart. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Now for another subject. I have finished my Abstract of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the chapter on Geographical Distribution, as bearing on my </td></tr>
<tr><td>subject. I should like you much to read it ; but I say this, </td></tr>
<tr><td>believing that you will not do so, if, as I believe to be the </td></tr>
<tr><td>case, you arc extra busy. On my honour, I shall not be </td></tr>
<tr><td>mortified, and I earnestly beg you not to do it, if it will </td></tr>

<tr><td>tion, and the position of the plumule and the radicle, and the </td></tr>
<tr><td>position and form of the whole embryo in the seed are </td></tr>
<tr><td>embryological, and how far are these very important ? I wish </td></tr>

<tr><td>I am sorry about Murray objecting to the term Abstract, </td></tr>
<tr><td>as I look at it as the only possible apology for not giving </td></tr>

<tr><td>I am also sorry about the term ��� natural selection.��� I hope </td></tr>
<tr><td>to retain it with explanation somewhat as thus : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� Through natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>Why I like the term is that it is constantly used in all </td></tr>

<tr><td>BY PROFESSOR HUXLEY. </td></tr>
<tr><td>ON THE RECEPTION OF THE ���ORIGIN OF SPECIES.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>To the present generation, that is to say, the people a few </td></tr>
<tr><td>years on the hither and thither side of thirty, the name of </td></tr>
<tr><td>Charles Darwin stands alongside of those of Isaac Newton and </td></tr>
<tr><td>Michael Faraday ; and, like them, calls up the grand ideal of </td></tr>
<tr><td>a searcher after truth and interpreter of Nature. They think </td></tr>
<tr><td>���of him who bore it as a rare combination of genius, industry, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and unswerving veracity, who earned his place among the </td></tr>
<tr><td>most famous men of the age by sheer native power, in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>teeth of a gale of popular prejudice, and uncheered by a </td></tr>
<tr><td>sign of favour or appreciation from the official fountains of </td></tr>
<tr><td>honour ; as one who, in spite of an acute sensitiveness to </td></tr>
<tr><td>praise and blame, and notwithstanding provocations which </td></tr>
<tr><td>might have excused any outbreak, kept himself clear of all </td></tr>
<tr><td>envy, hatred, and malice, nor dealt otherwise than fairly and </td></tr>
<tr><td>justly with the unfairness and injustice which was showered </td></tr>
<tr><td>upon him ; while, to the end of his days, he was ready to </td></tr>
<tr><td>listen with patience and respect to the most insignificant of </td></tr>
<tr><td>reasonable objectors. </td></tr>
<tr><td>And with respect to that theory of the origin of the forms of </td></tr>
<tr><td>life peopling our globe, with which Dan,vin���s name is bound up </td></tr>
<tr><td>as closely as that of Newton with the theory of gravitation, </td></tr>
<tr><td>nothing seems to be further from the mind of the present </td></tr>
<tr><td>generation than any attempt to smother it with ridicule or </td></tr>
<tr><td>to crush it by vehemence of denunciation. ��� The struggle for </td></tr>
<tr><td>N 2 </td></tr>
<tr><td>ON THE RECEPTION OF </td></tr>
<tr><td>existence," and " Natural selection,��� have become household </td></tr>
<tr><td>words and every-day conceptions. The reality and the im- </td></tr>
<tr><td>portance of the natural processes on which Darwin founds </td></tr>
<tr><td>his deductions are no more doubted than those of growth </td></tr>
<tr><td>and multiplication ; and, whether the full potency attributed </td></tr>
<tr><td>to them is admitted or not, no one doubts their vast and far- </td></tr>
<tr><td>reaching significance. Wherever the biological sciences are </td></tr>
<tr><td>studied, the ��� Origin of Species ��� lights the path of the in- </td></tr>
<tr><td>vestigator ; wherever they are taught it permeates the course </td></tr>
<tr><td>of instruction. Nor has the influence of Darwinian ideas </td></tr>
<tr><td>been less profound, beyond the realms of Biology. The </td></tr>
<tr><td>oldest of all philosophies, that of Evolution, was bound hand </td></tr>
<tr><td>and foot and cast into utter darkness during the millennium </td></tr>
<tr><td>of theological scholasticism. But Darwin poured new life- </td></tr>
<tr><td>blood into the ancient frame ; the bonds burst, and the </td></tr>
<tr><td>revivified thought of ancient Greece has proved itself to be </td></tr>
<tr><td>a more adequate expression of the universal order of things </td></tr>
<tr><td>than any of the schemes which have been accepted by the </td></tr>
<tr><td>credulity and welcomed by the superstition of seventy later </td></tr>
<tr><td>generations of men. </td></tr>
<tr><td>To any one who studies the signs of the times, the </td></tr>
<tr><td>emergence of the philosophy of Evolution, in the attitude of </td></tr>
<tr><td>claimant to the throne of the world of thought, from the </td></tr>
<tr><td>limbo of hated and, as many hoped, forgotten things, is the </td></tr>
<tr><td>most portentous event of the nineteenth century. But the </td></tr>
<tr><td>most effective weapons of the modem champions of Evolution </td></tr>
<tr><td>were fabricated by Darwin ; and the ��� Origin of Species ' has </td></tr>
<tr><td>enlisted a formidable body of combatants, trained in the se- </td></tr>
<tr><td>vere school of Physical Science, whose ears might have long </td></tr>
<tr><td>remained deaf to the speculations of a priori philosophers. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I do not think that any candid or instructed person will </td></tr>
<tr><td>deny the truth of that which has just been asserted. He may </td></tr>
<tr><td>hate the very name of Evolution, and may deny its pretensions </td></tr>
<tr><td>as vehemently as a Jacobite denied those of George the Second. </td></tr>
<tr><td>But there it is ��� not only as solidly seated as the Hanoverian </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� ORIGIN OF SPECIES.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>l8l </td></tr>
<tr><td>dynasty, but happily independent of Parliamentary sanction ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>and the dullest antagonists have come to see that they have </td></tr>
<tr><td>to deal with an adversary whose bones are to be broken by </td></tr>
<tr><td>no amount of bad words. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Even the theologians have almost ceased to pit the plain </td></tr>
<tr><td>meaning of Genesis against the no less plain meaning of </td></tr>
<tr><td>Nature. Their more candid, or more cautious, representatives </td></tr>
<tr><td>have given up dealing with Evolution as if it were a damnable </td></tr>
<tr><td>heresy, and have taken refuge in one of two courses. Either </td></tr>
<tr><td>they deny that Genesis was meant to teach scientific truth, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and thus save the veracity of the record at the expense of its </td></tr>
<tr><td>authority ; or they expend their energies in devising the cruel </td></tr>
<tr><td>ingenuities of the reconciler, and torture texts in the vain </td></tr>
<tr><td>hope of making them confess the creed of Science. But when </td></tr>
<tr><td>the peine forte et dure is over, the antique sincerity of the vener- </td></tr>
<tr><td>able sufferer always reasserts itself. Genesis is honest to the </td></tr>
<tr><td>core, and professes to be no more than it is, a repository of </td></tr>
<tr><td>venerable traditions of unknown origin, claiming no scientific </td></tr>
<tr><td>authority and possessing none. </td></tr>
<tr><td>As my pen finishes these passages, I can but be </td></tr>
<tr><td>amused to think what a terrible hubbub would have been </td></tr>
<tr><td>made (in truth was made) about any similar expressions of </td></tr>

<tr><td>proceeds from a writer whose want of intelligence, or of con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>science, or of both, is so great, that, by way of an objection to </td></tr>
<tr><td>Mr. Darwin���s views, he can ask, ��� Is it credible that all favour- </td></tr>

<tr><td>so ignorant of paleontology, that he can talk of the ��� flowers </td></tr>
<tr><td>and fruits ��� of the plants of the carboniferous epoch ; of com- </td></tr>

<tr><td>the ordinary laws of animal life, and peculiar to themselves </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the rudiments of physiology, that he can ask, ��� what </td></tr>

<tr><td>fail to flavour this outpouring of preposterous incapacity with </td></tr>
<tr><td>a little stimulation of the odium tlmlogicum. Some inkling </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the history of the conflicts between Astronomy, Geology, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and Theology, leads him to keep a retreat open by the </td></tr>
<tr><td>proviso that he cannot ���consent to test the truth of Natural </td></tr>
<tr><td>Science by the word of Revelation ; ��� but, for all that, he </td></tr>
<tr><td>devotes pages to the exposition of his conviction that Mr. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Darwin���s theory ���contradicts the revealed relation of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>creation to its Creator,��� and is ��� inconsistent with the fulness </td></tr>
<tr><td>of his glory.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>If I confine my retrospect of the reception of the ��� Origin </td></tr>
<tr><td>of Species ��� to a twelvemonth, or thereabouts, from the time </td></tr>
<tr><td>of its publication, I do not recollect anything quite so foolish </td></tr>
<tr><td>and unmannerly as the ���Quarterly Review��� article, unless, </td></tr>
<tr><td>perhaps, the address of a Reverend Professor to the Dublin </td></tr>
<tr><td>Geological Society might enter into competition with it But </td></tr>
<tr><td>a large proportion of Mr. Darwin���s critics had a lamentable </td></tr>
<tr><td>resemblance to the ���Quarterly��� reviewer, in so far as they </td></tr>
<tr><td>lacked either the will, or the wit, to make themselves masters </td></tr>
<tr><td>of his doctrine ; hardly any possessed the knowledge required </td></tr>
<tr><td>to follow him through the immense range of biological and </td></tr>
<tr><td>geological science which the ��� Origin ��� covered ; while, too </td></tr>
<tr><td>commonly, they had prejudged the case on theological </td></tr>
<tr><td>grounds, and, as seems to be inevitable when this happens, </td></tr>
<tr><td>eked out lack of reason by superfluity of railing. </td></tr>
<tr><td>But it will be more pleasant and more profitable to consider </td></tr>
<tr><td>those criticisms, which were acknowledged by writers of </td></tr>
<tr><td>scientific authority, or which bore internal evidence of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>greater or less competency and, often, of the good faith, of </td></tr>
<tr><td>their authors. Restricting my survey to a twelvemonth, or </td></tr>
<tr><td>thereabouts, after the publication of the ��� Origin,��� I find </td></tr>
<tr><td>among such critics Louis Agassiz;* Murray, an excellent </td></tr>
<tr><td>entomologist ; Harvey, a botanist of considerable repute ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>and the author of an article in the * Edinburgh Review,��� all </td></tr>
<tr><td>strongly adverse to Darwin. Pictet, the distinguished and </td></tr>

<tr><td>other people. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I think I must have read the ��� Vestiges ��� before I left Eng- </td></tr>
<tr><td>land in 1846 ; but, if I did, the book made very little impres- </td></tr>
<tr><td>sion upon me, and I was not brought into serious contact with </td></tr>
<tr><td>the ���Species��� question until after 1850. At that time, I had </td></tr>
<tr><td>long done with the Pentateuchal cosmogony, which had been </td></tr>
<tr><td>impressed upon my childish understanding as Divine truth, </td></tr>
<tr><td>with all the authority of parents and instructors, and from </td></tr>
<tr><td>which it had cost me many a struggle to get free. But my </td></tr>
<tr><td>mind was unbiassed in respect of any doctrine which presented </td></tr>
<tr><td>itself, if it professed to be based on purely philosophical and </td></tr>
<tr><td>scientific reasoning. It seemed to me then (as it does now) </td></tr>
<tr><td>that ��� creation,��� in the ordinary sense of the word, is perfectly </td></tr>
<tr><td>conceivable. I find no difficulty in imagining that, at some </td></tr>
<tr><td>former period, this universe was not in existence ; and that </td></tr>
<tr><td>it made its appearance in six days (or instantaneously, if </td></tr>
<tr><td>that is preferred), in consequence of the volition of some pre- </td></tr>
<tr><td>existent Being. Then, as now, the so-called a priori argu- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ments against Theism, and, given a Deity, against the </td></tr>
<tr><td>possibility of creative acts, appeared to me to be devoid of </td></tr>
<tr><td>reasonable foundation. I had not then, and I have not now, </td></tr>
<tr><td>the smallest a priori objection to raise to the account of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>creation of animals and plants given in ��� Paradise Lost,��� in </td></tr>
<tr><td>which Milton so vividly embodies the natural sense of Genesis. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Far be it from me to say that it is untrue because it is impos- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ON THE RECEPTION OF </td></tr>
<tr><td>1 88 </td></tr>
<tr><td>sible. I confine myself to what must be regarded as a modest </td></tr>
<tr><td>and reasonable request for some particle of evidence that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>existing species of animals and plants did originate in that </td></tr>
<tr><td>way, as a condition of my belief in a statement which appears </td></tr>
<tr><td>to me to be highly improbable. </td></tr>
<tr><td>And, by way of being perfectly fair, I had exactly the </td></tr>
<tr><td>same answer to give to the evolutionists of 1851-8. Within </td></tr>
<tr><td>the ranks of the biologists, at that time, I met with nobody, </td></tr>
<tr><td>except Dr. Grant, of University College, who had a word to say </td></tr>
<tr><td>for Evolution ��� and his advocacy was not calculated to advance </td></tr>
<tr><td>the cause. Outside these ranks, the only person known to me </td></tr>
<tr><td>whose knowledge and capacity compelled respect, and who </td></tr>
<tr><td>was, at the same time, a thorough-going evolutionist, was Mr. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Herbert Spencer, whose acquaintance I made, I think, in </td></tr>
<tr><td>1852, and then entered into the bonds of a friendship which, </td></tr>
<tr><td>I am happy to think, has known no interruption. Many and </td></tr>
<tr><td>prolonged were the battles we fought on this topic. But </td></tr>
<tr><td>even my friend���s rare dialectic skill and copiousness of </td></tr>
<tr><td>apt illustration could not drive me from my agnostic position. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I took my stand upon two grounds : firstly, that up to that </td></tr>
<tr><td>time, the evidence in favour of transmutation was wholly </td></tr>
<tr><td>insufficient; and, secondly, that no suggestion respecting </td></tr>
<tr><td>the causes of the transmutation assumed, which had been </td></tr>
<tr><td>made, was in any way adequate to explain the phenomena. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Looking back at the state of knowledge at that time, I </td></tr>
<tr><td>really do not see that any other conclusion was justifiable. </td></tr>
<tr><td>In those days I had never even heard of Treviranus��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� Biologic.��� However, I had studied Lamarck attentively and </td></tr>
<tr><td>I had read the ��� Vestiges ��� with due care ; but neither of them </td></tr>
<tr><td>afforded me any good ground for changing my negative </td></tr>
<tr><td>and critical attitude. As for the ��� Vestiges,��� I confess that </td></tr>
<tr><td>the book simply irritated me by the prodigious ignorance </td></tr>
<tr><td>and thoroughly unscientific habit of mind manifested by the </td></tr>
<tr><td>writer. If it had any influence on me at all, it set me </td></tr>
<tr><td>against Evolution ; and the only review I ever have qualms </td></tr>
<tr><td>THE ���ORIGIN OF SPECIES.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>of conscience about, on the ground of needless savagery, is </td></tr>
<tr><td>one I wrote on the ��� Vestiges ��� while under that influence. </td></tr>
<tr><td>With respect to the ���Philosophie Zoologique,��� it is no </td></tr>
<tr><td>reproach to Lamarck to say that the discussion of the Species </td></tr>
<tr><td>question in that work, whatever might be said for it in 1809, </td></tr>
<tr><td>was miserably below the level of the knowledge of half a </td></tr>
<tr><td>century later. In that interval of time the elucidation of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the structure of the lower animals and plants had given rise </td></tr>
<tr><td>to wholly new conceptions of their relations ; histology and </td></tr>
<tr><td>embryology, in the modern sense, had been created ; physio- </td></tr>
<tr><td>logy had been reconstituted ; the facts of distribution, </td></tr>
<tr><td>geological and geographical, had been prodigiously multi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>plied and reduced to order. To any biologist whose studies </td></tr>
<tr><td>had carried him beyond mere species-mongering in 1850, one- </td></tr>
<tr><td>half of Lamarck���s arguments were obsolete and the other </td></tr>
<tr><td>half erroneous, or defective, in virtue of omitting to deal with </td></tr>
<tr><td>the various classes of evidence which had been brought to </td></tr>
<tr><td>light since his time. Moreover his one suggestion as to the </td></tr>
<tr><td>cause of the gradual modifleation of species ��� effort excited </td></tr>
<tr><td>by change of conditions ��� was, on the face of it, inapplicable to </td></tr>
<tr><td>the whole vegetable world. I do not think that any impartial </td></tr>
<tr><td>judge who reads the ��� Philosophie Zoologique ��� now, and who </td></tr>
<tr><td>aftenvards takes up Lyell���s trenchant and effectual criticism </td></tr>
<tr><td>(published as far back as 1830), will be disposed to allot </td></tr>
<tr><td>to Lamarck a much higher place in the establishment of </td></tr>
<tr><td>biological evolution than that which Bacon assigns to himself </td></tr>
<tr><td>in relation to physical science generally , ��� buccinator tautum.' </td></tr>
<tr><td>But, by a curious irony of fate, the same influence which </td></tr>
<tr><td>led me to put as little faith in modem speculations on this </td></tr>
<tr><td>subject, as in the venerable traditions recorded in the first two </td></tr>
<tr><td>chapters of Genesis, was perhaps more potent than any other </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� Erasmus Darwin first promul- claims have failed to show that he, </td></tr>

<tr><td>which, whether it takes him straight home or not, certainly </td></tr>

<tr><td>such as could be proved to be actually at work. We wanted, </td></tr>

<tr><td>Whether the particular shape which the doctrine of evolu- </td></tr>

<tr><td>would prove to be final or not, was, to me, a matter of indifier- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ON THE RECEPTION OF </td></tr>
<tr><td>I9S </td></tr>
<tr><td>ence. In my earliest criticisms of the ��� Origin ��� I ventured to- </td></tr>
<tr><td>point out that its logical foundation was insecure so long as. </td></tr>
<tr><td>experiments in selective breeding had not produced varieties </td></tr>
<tr><td>which were more or less infertile ; and that insecurity remains </td></tr>
<tr><td>up to the present time. But, with any and every critical doubt </td></tr>
<tr><td>which my sceptical ingenuity could suggest, the Darwinian </td></tr>
<tr><td>hypothesis remained incomparably more probable than the </td></tr>
<tr><td>creation hypothesis. And if we had none of us been able ta </td></tr>
<tr><td>discern the paramount significance of some of the most patent </td></tr>
<tr><td>and notorious of natural facts, until they were, so to speak, </td></tr>
<tr><td>thrust under our noses, what force remained in the dilemma ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>creation or nothing? It was obvious that, hereafter, the </td></tr>
<tr><td>probability would be immensely greater, that the links of </td></tr>
<tr><td>natural causation were hidden from our purblind eyes, than </td></tr>
<tr><td>that natural causation should be incompetent to produce ail </td></tr>
<tr><td>the phenomena of nature. The only rational course for those </td></tr>
<tr><td>who had no other object than the attainment of truth, was to </td></tr>
<tr><td>accept ��� Darwinism ��� as a working hypothesis, and see what </td></tr>
<tr><td>could be made of it Either it would prove its capacity to </td></tr>
<tr><td>elucidate the facts of organic life, or it would break down under </td></tr>
<tr><td>the strain. This was surely the dictate of common sense </td></tr>
<tr><td>and, for once, common sense carried the day. The result has </td></tr>
<tr><td>been that complete volte-face of the whole scientific world, </td></tr>
<tr><td>which must seem so surprising to the present generation. I </td></tr>
<tr><td>do not mean to say that all the leaders of biological science </td></tr>
<tr><td>have avowed themselves Dar^vinians ; but I do not think </td></tr>

<tr><td>so far as my knowledge goes, all the ingenuity and all the </td></tr>
<tr><td>learning of hostile critics has not enabled them to adduce a </td></tr>
<tr><td>solitary fact, of which it can be said, this is irreconcilable with </td></tr>
<tr><td>the Darwinian theory. In the prodigious variety and com- </td></tr>

<tr><td>199 </td></tr>
<tr><td>plexity of organic nature, there arc multitudes of phenomena </td></tr>
<tr><td>which are not deduciblc from any generalisations we have yet </td></tr>
<tr><td>reached. But the same may be said of every other class of </td></tr>
<tr><td>natural objects. I believe that astronomers cannot yet get </td></tr>
<tr><td>the moon���s motions into perfect accordance with the theory </td></tr>
<tr><td>of gravitation. </td></tr>
<tr><td>It would be inappropriate, even if it were possible, to dis- </td></tr>
<tr><td>cuss the difficulties and unresolved problems which have </td></tr>
<tr><td>hitherto met the evolutionist, and which will probably continue </td></tr>
<tr><td>to puzzle him for many generations to come, in the course of </td></tr>
<tr><td>this brief history of the reception of Mr. Darwin���s great work. </td></tr>
<tr><td>But there are two or three objections of a more general </td></tr>
<tr><td>character, based, or supposed to be based, upon philosophical </td></tr>
<tr><td>and theological foundations, which were loudly expressed in </td></tr>
<tr><td>the early days of the Darwinian controversy, and which, </td></tr>
<tr><td>though they have been answered over and over again, crop </td></tr>
<tr><td>up now and then at the present day. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The most singular of these, perhaps immortal, fallacies, </td></tr>
<tr><td>which live bn, Tithonus-like, when sense and force have long </td></tr>
<tr><td>deserted them, is that which charges Mr. Darwin with having </td></tr>
<tr><td>attempted to reinstate the old pagan goddess. Chance. It is </td></tr>

<tr><td>and that the fittest survive the ��� chances ��� of the struggle for </td></tr>

<tr><td>It is not a little wonderful that such an accusation as this </td></tr>

<tr><td>commoner and coarser forms of Teleology. But perhaps the </td></tr>
<tr><td>most remarkable service to the philosophy of Biology ren- </td></tr>
<tr><td>dered by Mr. Darwin is the reconciliation of Teleology and </td></tr>
<tr><td>Morphology, and the explanation of the facts of both, which </td></tr>
<tr><td>his views offer. The teleology which supposes that the eye, </td></tr>

<tr><td>made with the precise structure it exhibits, for the purpose of </td></tr>
<tr><td>enabling the animal which possesses it to see, has undoubtedly </td></tr>
<tr><td>received its death-blow. Nevertheless, it is necessary to re- </td></tr>
<tr><td>member that there is a wider teleology which is not touched </td></tr>
<tr><td>by the doctrine of Evolution, but is actually based upon the </td></tr>
<tr><td>fundamental proposition of Evolution. This proposition is </td></tr>
<tr><td>that the whole world, living and not living, is the result of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>mutual interaction, according to definite laws, of the forces ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>possessed by the molecules of which the primitive nebulosity </td></tr>

<tr><td>Evolution must be consistent with those attributes. And, if </td></tr>

<tr><td>which it is absolutely inconsistent, is the conception of </td></tr>

<tr><td>excuse, that it was most difficult to decide what to omit. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Birds, which have struggled in their own homes, when settled </td></tr>

<tr><td>Madeira they have, as I believe, been kept constant by the </td></tr>
<tr><td>frequent arrival, and the crossing with unaltered immigrants </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the same species from the main land. In Bermuda this </td></tr>
<tr><td>can be proved, in Madeira highly probable, as shown me by </td></tr>
<tr><td>letters from E. V. Harcourt. Moreover, there are ample ground, </td></tr>
<tr><td>for believing that the crossed offspring of the new immigrants </td></tr>
<tr><td>(fresh blood as breeders would say), and old colonists of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>same species would be extra vigorous, and would be the most </td></tr>

<tr><td>On t]ie continued Creation of Monads. ��� This doctrine is </td></tr>
<tr><td>.superfluous (and groundless) on the theory of Natural Selec- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tion, which implies no necessary tendency to progression. A </td></tr>
<tr><td>monad, if no deviation in its structure profitable to it under </td></tr>
<tr><td>its excessively simple conditions of life occurred, might remain </td></tr>
<tr><td>unaltered from long before the Silurian Age to the present </td></tr>
<tr><td>day. I grant there will generally be a tendency to advance </td></tr>
<tr><td>in complexity of organisation, though in beings fitted for very </td></tr>
<tr><td>simple conditions it w'ould be slight and slow. How could </td></tr>
<tr><td>a complex organisation profit a monad ? if it did not profit </td></tr>
<tr><td>it there would be no advance. The Secondary Infusoria differ </td></tr>
<tr><td>but little from the living. The parent monad form might </td></tr>
<tr><td>perfectly well survive unaltered and fitted for its simple </td></tr>
<tr><td>conditions, whilst the offspring of this very monad might </td></tr>
<tr><td>become fitted for more complex conditions. The one prim- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ordial prototype of all living and extinct creatures may, </td></tr>
<tr><td>it is possible, be now alive! Moreover, as you say, higher </td></tr>
<tr><td>forms might be occasionally degraded, the snake Typhlops </td></tr>
<tr><td>seems (? !) to have the habits of earth-worms. So that fresh </td></tr>
<tr><td>creations of simple forms seem to me wholly superfluous. </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� Must you not assume a primeval creative power which </td></tr>
<tr><td>does not cut with uniformity, or how could man supervene /��� ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>I am not sure that I understand your remarks which follow </td></tr>
<tr><td>the above. We must, under present knowledge, assume the </td></tr>
<tr><td>creation of one or of a few forms in the same manner as philo- </td></tr>
<tr><td>sophers assume the existence of a power of attraction without </td></tr>
<tr><td>any explanation. But I entirely reject, as in my judgment </td></tr>
<tr><td>quite unnecessary, any subsequent addition ��� of new powers </td></tr>
<tr><td>and attributes and forces or of any ��� principle of improve- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ment,��� except in so far as every character which is naturally </td></tr>
<tr><td>selected or preserved is in some way an advantage or improve- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ment, otherwise it would not have been selected. If I were </td></tr>
<tr><td>convinced that I required such additions to the theory of </td></tr>
<tr><td>natural selection, I would reject it as rubbish, but I have firm </td></tr>
<tr><td>faith in it, as I cannot believe, that if false, it would explain so </td></tr>
<tr><td>many whole classes of facts, which, if I am in my senses, it </td></tr>
<tr><td>seems to explain. As far as I understand your remarks and </td></tr>
<tr><td>illustrations, you doubt the possibility, of gradations of intel- </td></tr>
<tr><td>lectual powers. Now, it seems to me, looking to existing </td></tr>
<tr><td>animals alone, that we have a very fine gradation in the intel- </td></tr>
<tr><td>lectual powers of the Vertebrata, with one rather wide gap (not </td></tr>
<tr><td>half so wide as in many cases of corporeal structure), between </td></tr>
<tr><td>say a Hottentot and an Ourang, even if civilised as much </td></tr>
<tr><td>mentally as the dog has been from the wolf. I suppose that </td></tr>
<tr><td>you do not doubt that the intellectual powers are as important </td></tr>
<tr><td>for the welfare of each being as corporeal structure ; if so, I </td></tr>
<tr><td>can see no difficulty in the most intellectual individuals of a </td></tr>
<tr><td>species being continually selected ; and the intellect of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>new species thus improved, aided probably by effects of </td></tr>
<tr><td>inherited mental exercise. I look at this process as now </td></tr>
<tr><td>going on with the races of man ; the less intellectual races </td></tr>
<tr><td>being exterminated. But there is not space to discuss this </td></tr>
<tr><td>point. If I understand you, the turning-point in our difference </td></tr>
<tr><td>must be, that you think it impossible that the intellectual </td></tr>
<tr><td>powers of a species should be much improved by the con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tinued natural selection of the most intellectual individuals. </td></tr>
<tr><td>To show how minds graduate, just reflect how impossible </td></tr>
<tr><td>every one has yet found it, to define tlie difference in mind </td></tr>
<tr><td>of man and the lower animals ; the latter seem to have the </td></tr>
<tr><td>very same attributes in a much lower stage of perfection than </td></tr>
<tr><td>the lowest savage. I would give absolutely nothing for the </td></tr>
<tr><td>theory of Natural Selection, if it requires miraculous additions </td></tr>
<tr><td>at any one stage of descent. 1 think Embryology, Homo- </td></tr>
<tr><td>l��Sy> Classification, &c &c., show us that all vertebrata have </td></tr>
<tr><td>descended from one parent ; how that parent appeared we </td></tr>
<tr><td>know not. If you admit in ever so little a degree, the </td></tr>
<tr><td>explanation which I have given of Embryology, Homology </td></tr>
<tr><td>and Classification, you will find it difficult to say : thus far </td></tr>
<tr><td>the explanation holds good, hut no further; here we must </td></tr>
<tr><td>call in ���the addition of new creative forces.��� I think you </td></tr>
<tr><td>212 PUBLICATION OF THE ���ORIGIN OF SPECIES.��� [1859. </td></tr>
<tr><td>will be driven to reject all or admit all : I fear by your letter </td></tr>
<tr><td>it will be the former alternative ; and in that case I shall feel </td></tr>
<tr><td>sure it is my fault, and not the theory���s fault, and this will </td></tr>
<tr><td>certainly comfort me. With regard to the descent of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>great Kingdoms (as Vertebrata, Articulata, &c.) from one </td></tr>
<tr><td>parent, I have said in the conclusion, that mere analogy </td></tr>
<tr><td>makes me think it probable ; my arguments and facts are </td></tr>
<tr><td>sound in my judgment only for each separate kingdom. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The forms which are beaten inluriting some inferiority in </td></tr>
<tr><td>common. ��� I dare say I have not been guarded enough, but </td></tr>
<tr><td>might not the term inferiority include less perfect adaptation </td></tr>
<tr><td>to physical conditions .> </td></tr>
<tr><td>My remarks apply not to single species, but to groups or </td></tr>
<tr><td>genera ; the species of most genera are adapted at least to </td></tr>
<tr><td>rather hotter, and rather less hot, to rather damper and dryer </td></tr>
<tr><td>climates ; and when the several species of a group are beaten </td></tr>
<tr><td>and exterminated by the several species of another group, it </td></tr>
<tr><td>will not, I think, generally be from each new species being </td></tr>
<tr><td>adapted to the climate, but from all the new species having </td></tr>
<tr><td>some common advantage in obtaining sustenance, or escaping </td></tr>
<tr><td>enemies. As groups arc concerned, a fairer illustration than </td></tr>
<tr><td>negro and white in Liberia would be the almost certain future </td></tr>
<tr><td>extinction of the genus ourang by the genus man, not owing </td></tr>
<tr><td>to man being better fitted for the climate, but owing to the </td></tr>
<tr><td>inherited intellectual inferiority of the Ourang-genus to Man- </td></tr>
<tr><td>genus, by his intellect, inventing fire-arms and cutting down </td></tr>
<tr><td>forests. I believe, from reasons given in my discussion, that </td></tr>
<tr><td>acclimatisation is readily effected under nature. It has taken </td></tr>
<tr><td>me so many years to disabuse my mind of the too great import- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ance of climate ��� its important influence being so conspicuous, </td></tr>
<tr><td>whilst that of a struggle between creature and creature is so </td></tr>
<tr><td>hidden ��� that I am inclined to swear at the North Pole, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>as Sydney Smith said, even to speak disrespectfully .of the </td></tr>

<tr><td>there is a wide distinction between Rudimentary Organs and </td></tr>

<tr><td>the gums ��� the papillm, representing the pistil in male flowers, </td></tr>
<tr><td>wing of Apteryx, or better, the little wings under soldered </td></tr>

<tr><td>they would be useless in a less developed state. Natural Selec- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tion acts exclusively by preserving successive slight, useful </td></tr>
<tr><td>modifleations. Hence Natural Selection cannot possibly make </td></tr>
<tr><td>a useless or rudimentary organ. Such organs are solely due </td></tr>
<tr><td>to inheritance (as explained in my discussion), and plainly </td></tr>
<tr><td>bespeak an ancestor having the organ in a useful condition. </td></tr>
<tr><td>They may be, and often have been, worked in for other pur- </td></tr>
<tr><td>poses, and then they are only rudimentary for the original </td></tr>
<tr><td>function, which is sometimes plainly apparent. A nascent </td></tr>
<tr><td>organ, though little developed, as it has to be developed must </td></tr>

<tr><td>organ well developed. The mammary glands in Ornitho- </td></tr>

<tr><td>as a wing ; not that I think so ; for the whole structure of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>bird is adapted for flight, and a penguin so closely resembles </td></tr>
<tr><td>other birds, that we may infer that its wings have probably </td></tr>
<tr><td>been modified, and reduced by natural selection, in accordance </td></tr>
<tr><td>with its sub-aquatic habits. Analogy thus often serves as a </td></tr>
<tr><td>guide in distinguishing whether an organ is rudimentary or </td></tr>
<tr><td>nascent I believe the Os coccyx gives attachment to certain </td></tr>
<tr><td>muscles, but I cannot doubt that it is a rudimentary tail. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The bastard wing of birds is a rudimentary digit ; and I </td></tr>

<tr><td>improved. Passages in your book, like that to which I have </td></tr>

<tr><td>My dear Huxley, ��� Yesterday evening, when I read the </td></tr>
<tr><td>Times of a previous day, I was amazed to find a splendid </td></tr>
<tr><td>essay and review of me. Who can the author be? I am </td></tr>
<tr><td>intensely curious. It included an eulogium of me which quite </td></tr>
<tr><td>touched me, though I am not vain enough to think it all </td></tr>
<tr><td>deserved. The author is a literary man, and German scholar. </td></tr>
<tr><td>He has read my book very attentively ; but, what is very </td></tr>
<tr><td>remarkable, it seems that he is a profound naturalist. He </td></tr>
<tr><td>knows my Barnacle-book, and appreciates it too highly. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Lastly, he writes and thinks with quite uncommon force and </td></tr>
<tr><td>clearness ; and what is even still rarer, his writing is seasoned </td></tr>
<tr><td>with most pleasant wit We all laughed heartily over some </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the sentences. I was charmed with those unreasonable </td></tr>
<tr><td>mortals, who know anything, all thinking fit to range them- </td></tr>
<tr><td>selves on one side.* Who can it be? Certainly I should </td></tr>
<tr><td>have said that there was only one man in England who could </td></tr>
<tr><td>have written this essay, and that you were the man. But I </td></tr>
<tr><td>suppose I am wrong, and that there is some hidden genius of </td></tr>
<tr><td>great calibre. For how could you influence Jupiter Olympius </td></tr>
<tr><td>and make him give three and a half columns to pure science ? </td></tr>
<tr><td>The old fogies will think the world will come to an end. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Well, whoever the man is, he has done great service to the </td></tr>
<tr><td>cause, far more than by a dozen reviews in common peri- </td></tr>
<tr><td>odicals. The grand way he soars above common religious </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� The reviewer proposes to pass </td></tr>
<tr><td>by the orthodox view, according to </td></tr>
<tr><td>which the phenomena of the organic </td></tr>
<tr><td>world are ��� the immediate product </td></tr>
<tr><td>of a creative fiat, and consequently </td></tr>
<tr><td>are out of the domain of science </td></tr>
<tr><td>altogether." And he does so ��� with </td></tr>
<tr><td>less hesitation, as it so happens </td></tr>
<tr><td>that those persons who arc prac- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tically conversant with the facts of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the case (plainly a considerable </td></tr>
<tr><td>advantage) have always thought </td></tr>
<tr><td>fit to range themselves��� in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>category of those holding ���views </td></tr>

<tr><td>basis only, and therefore admit </td></tr>

<tr><td>[It is impossible to give in a short space an adequate idea </td></tr>
<tr><td>of Mr. Huxley���s article in the Times of December 26. It is </td></tr>
<tr><td>admirably planned, so as to claim for the ��� Origin ��� a respectful </td></tr>
<tr><td>hearing, and it abstains from anything like dogmatism in </td></tr>
<tr><td>asserting the truth of the doctrines therein upheld. A few pas- </td></tr>
<tr><td>sages may be quoted : ��� ��� That this most ingenious hypothesis </td></tr>
<tr><td>enables us to give a reason for many apparent anomalies in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>distribution of living beings in time and space, and that it is not </td></tr>
<tr><td>contradicted by the main phenomena of life and organisation, </td></tr>
<tr><td>appear to us to be unquestionable.��� Mr. Huxley goes on to </td></tr>
<tr><td>recommend to the readers of the ��� Origin ��� a condition of </td></tr>
<tr><td>"thdtige Skepsis " ��� a state of ���doubt which so loves truth </td></tr>
<tr><td>that it neither dares rest in doubting, nor extinguish itself </td></tr>
<tr><td>by unjustified belief.��� The final paragraph is in a strong </td></tr>
<tr><td>contrast to Professor Sedgwick and his ��� ropes of bubbles ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>(see p. 298). Mr. Huxley writes : ��� Mr. Darwin abhors mere </td></tr>
<tr><td>speculation as nature abhors a vacuum. He is as greedy of </td></tr>
<tr><td>cases and precedents as any constitutional lawyer, and all the </td></tr>
<tr><td>principles he lays down are capable of being brought to the </td></tr>
<tr><td>test of observation and experiment. The path he bids us </td></tr>
<tr><td>follow professes to be not a mere airy track, fabricated of </td></tr>
<tr><td>ideal cobwebs, but a solid and broad bridge of facts. If it be </td></tr>
<tr><td>so, it will carry us safely over many a chasm in our know- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ledge, and lead us to a region free from the snares of those </td></tr>
<tr><td>fascinating but barren virgins, the Final Causes, against whom </td></tr>
<tr><td>a high authority has so justly warned us.��� </td></tr>

<tr><td>���as it did in the leading daily Journal, must have had a strong </td></tr>
<tr><td>influence on the reading public. Mr. Huxley allows me to </td></tr>
<tr><td>quote from a letter an account of the happy chance that threw </td></tr>
<tr><td>into his hands the opportunity of writing it. </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� The ��� Origin ��� was sent to Mr. Lucas, one of the staff of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the Times writers at that day, in what I suppose was the </td></tr>
<tr><td>ordinary course of business. Mr. Lucas, though an excellent </td></tr>
<tr><td>journalist, and, at a later period, editor of ��� Once a Week,��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>was as innocent of any knowledge of science as a babe, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>bewailed himself to an acquaintance on having to deal with </td></tr>
<tr><td>such a book. Whereupon he was recommended to ask me to </td></tr>
<tr><td>get him out of his difficulty, and he applied to me accordingly, </td></tr>
<tr><td>explaining, however, that it would be necessary for him </td></tr>
<tr><td>formally to adopt anything 'I might be disposed to write, by </td></tr>
<tr><td>prefacing it with two or three paragraphs of his own. </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� I was too anxious to seize upon the opportunity thus </td></tr>
<tr><td>offered of giving the book a fair chance with the multitudinous </td></tr>
<tr><td>readers of the Times to make any difficulty about condi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tions ; and being then very full of the subject, I wrote the </td></tr>
<tr><td>article faster, I think, than I ever wrote anything in my life, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and sent it to Mr. Lucas, who duly prefixed his opening </td></tr>
<tr><td>sentences. </td></tr>
<tr><td>" When the article appeared, there was much speculation as </td></tr>
<tr><td>to its authorship. The secret leaked out in time, as all secrets </td></tr>
<tr><td>will, but not by my aid ; and then I used to derive a good </td></tr>
<tr><td>deal of innocent amusement from the vehement assertions of </td></tr>
<tr><td>Some of my more acute friends, that they knew it was mine </td></tr>
<tr><td>from the first paragraph I </td></tr>

<tr><td>judgment it is by far the grandest and most interesting essay, </td></tr>
<tr><td>on subjects of the nature discussed, I have ever read. You </td></tr>
<tr><td>know how I admired your former essays, but this seems to </td></tr>
<tr><td>me far grander. I like all the part after p. xxvi better than </td></tr>
<tr><td>the first part, probably because newer to me. I dare say you </td></tr>
<tr><td>will demur to this, for I think every author likes the most </td></tr>
<tr><td>speculative parts of his own productions. How superior your </td></tr>
<tr><td>essay is to the famous one of Brown (here will be sneer 1st </td></tr>
<tr><td>from you). You have made all your conclusions so admirably </td></tr>
<tr><td>clear, that it would be no use at all to be a botanist (sneer </td></tr>
<tr><td>No. 2). By Jove, it would do harm to affix any idea to the </td></tr>
<tr><td>long names of outlandish orders. One can look at your con- </td></tr>

<tr><td>stop the introduction of Australian plants. Towards the close </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the essay (page civ), you have admirable remarks on our </td></tr>

<tr><td>or introduction ; I would answer p. 1, by a later page, viz. </td></tr>
<tr><td>p. civ. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Your contrast of the south-west and south-east corners is </td></tr>
<tr><td>one of the most wonderful cases I ever heard of. . . . You </td></tr>

<tr><td>down or destroying an original Flora, which was richer in </td></tr>

<tr><td>My DEAR Darwin, ��� You have my hurried letter telling </td></tr>
<tr><td>you of the arrival of the remainder of the sheets of the reprint, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and of the stir I had made for a reprint in Boston. Well, all </td></tr>
<tr><td>looked pretty well, when, lo, we found that a second New </td></tr>
<tr><td>York publishing house had announced a reprint also! I wrote </td></tr>
<tr><td>then to both New York publishers, asking them to give way </td></tr>
<tr><td>to the author and his reprint of a revised edition. I got </td></tr>
<tr><td>an answer from the Harpers that they withdraw ��� from the </td></tr>
<tr><td>Applctons that they had got the book out (and the next day </td></tr>
<tr><td>I saw a copy) ; but that, ��� if the work should have any con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>siderable sale, we certainly shall be disposed to pay the </td></tr>
<tr><td>author reasonably and liberally.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>The Applctons being thus out with their reprint, the Boston </td></tr>
<tr><td>house declined to go on. So I wrote to the Applctons taking </td></tr>
<tr><td>i 860.] dr. gray���s criticisms. 271 </td></tr>
<tr><td>them at their word, offering to aid their reprint, to give them </td></tr>
<tr><td>the use of the alterations in the London reprint, as soon as I </td></tr>
<tr><td>find out what they are, &c. &c. And I sent them the first </td></tr>
<tr><td>leaf, and asked them to insert in their future issue the addi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tional matter from Butler,* which tells just right. So there </td></tr>
<tr><td>the matter stands. If you furnish any matter in advance of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the London third edition, I will make them pay for it </td></tr>
<tr><td>I may get something for you. All got is clear gain ; but it </td></tr>
<tr><td>will not be very much, I suppose. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Such little notices in the papers here as have yet appeared </td></tr>
<tr><td>are quite handsome and considerate. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I hope next week to get printed sheets of my review from </td></tr>
<tr><td>New Haven, and send [them] to you, and will ask you to pass </td></tr>
<tr><td>them on to Dr. Hooker. </td></tr>
<tr><td>To fulfil your request, I ought to tell you what I think </td></tr>
<tr><td>the weakest, and what the best, part of your book. But </td></tr>
<tr><td>this is not easy, nor to be done in a word or hvo. The best </td></tr>
<tr><td>part, I think, is the w/iole, i.e. its plan and treatment, the vast </td></tr>
<tr><td>amount of facts and acute inferences handled as if you had a </td></tr>
<tr><td>perfect mastery of them. I do not think twenty years too </td></tr>
<tr><td>much time to produce such a book in. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Style clear and good, but now and then wants revision for </td></tr>
<tr><td>little matters (p. 97, self-fertilises itself, &c.). </td></tr>
<tr><td>Then your candour is worth everything to your cause. It </td></tr>
<tr><td>is refreshing to find a person with a new theory who frankly </td></tr>
<tr><td>confesses that he finds difficulties, insurmountable, at least </td></tr>
<tr><td>for the present. I know some people who never have any </td></tr>
<tr><td>difficulties to speak of. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The moment I understood your premisses, I felt sure you </td></tr>
<tr><td>had a real foundation to hold on. Well, if one admits your </td></tr>
<tr><td>premisses, I do not see how he is to stop short of your conclu- </td></tr>
<tr><td>sions, as a probable hypothesis at least. </td></tr>

<tr><td>It naturally happens that my review of your book does not </td></tr>

<tr><td>has made upon me. Under the circumstances I suppose I do </td></tr>
<tr><td>your theory more good here, by bespeaking for it a fair and </td></tr>
<tr><td>favourable consideration, and by standing non-committed as </td></tr>
<tr><td>to its full conclusions, than I should if I announced myself a </td></tr>
<tr><td>convert ; nor could I say the latter, with truth. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Well, what seems to me the weakest point in the book is </td></tr>
<tr><td>the attempt to account for the formation of organs, the making </td></tr>
<tr><td>of eyes, &c., by natural selection. Some of this reads quite </td></tr>
<tr><td>Lamarckian. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The chapter on Hybridism is not a weak, but a strong </td></tr>
<tr><td>chapter. You have done wonders there. But still you have </td></tr>
<tr><td>not accounted, as you may be held to account, for divergence </td></tr>

<tr><td>crosses, but carried one short almost imperceptible step more, </td></tr>

<tr><td>I cannot conceive any existing reptile being converted into </td></tr>

<tr><td>(and in a lesser degree bird character) with mammalian. We </td></tr>

<tr><td>now, between reptiles and fish, between mammals and </td></tr>
<tr><td>birds on the one hand (for they retain longer the same em- </td></tr>
<tr><td>bryological character) and reptiles on the other hand. With </td></tr>
<tr><td>respect to a mammal not being developed on any island, </td></tr>
<tr><td>besides want of time for so prodigious a development, there </td></tr>

<tr><td>with your precision, or at all under the point of view of </td></tr>
<tr><td>Natural Selection not having done what might have been </td></tr>

<tr><td>I know of no fact showing any the least incipient variation of </td></tr>
<tr><td>seals feeding on the shore. Moreover, seals wander much ; </td></tr>

<tr><td>profound, why one form is preserved with nearly the same </td></tr>

<tr><td>Never think of this, for I look at every letter of yours as an </td></tr>

<tr><td>of 13 closely written folio pages to answer on species ! . . . . </td></tr>
<tr><td>I have a very decided opinion that all mammals must have </td></tr>

<tr><td>details, very many of them of extremely little importance to </td></tr>
<tr><td>their habits (as the number of bones of the head, &c., covering </td></tr>
<tr><td>of hair, identical embryological development, &c. &c.). Now </td></tr>
<tr><td>this large amount of similarity I must look at as certainly </td></tr>
<tr><td>due to inheritance from a common stock. I am aware that </td></tr>
<tr><td>some cases occur in which a similar or nearly similar organ </td></tr>
<tr><td>has been acquired by independent acts of natural selection. </td></tr>
<tr><td>But in most of such cases of these apparently so closely </td></tr>

<tr><td>why I think so strongly that all have descended from one </td></tr>
<tr><td>progenitor. I have just re-read your letter, and I am not </td></tr>
<tr><td>perfectly sure that I understand your point. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I enclose two diagrams showing the sort of manner I conjec- </td></tr>

<tr><td>(Please read the paragraph.) I have not knowledge enough </td></tr>

<tr><td>vainly sought an exception. A French paper also gives </td></tr>
<tr><td>numerous cases, and one very curious case of a kitten which </td></tr>
<tr><td>gradually lost the blue colour in its eyes and as gradually </td></tr>
<tr><td>acquired its power of hearing. I had not heard of your uncle, </td></tr>

<tr><td>some, and near the tail in others, and supplied by wholly </td></tr>

<tr><td>third chapter of ���The Variation of Animals and Plants��� still </td></tr>
<tr><td>on his hands. It had been begun in the previous August, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and was not finished until March 1861. He was, however, for </td></tr>
<tr><td>part of this time (I believe during December i860 and </td></tr>
<tr><td>January 1861) engaged in a new edition (3000 copies) of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� Origin,��� which was largely corrected and added to, and was </td></tr>
<tr><td>published in April 1861. </td></tr>
<tr><td>With regard to this, the third edition, he wrote to Mr. Murray </td></tr>
<tr><td>in December i860: ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� I shall be glad to hear when you have decided how many </td></tr>

<tr><td>have made in hopes of making my many rather stupid </td></tr>

<tr><td>took the work of translation. The book was now spreading </td></tr>
<tr><td>on the Continent, a Dutch edition had appeared, and, as we </td></tr>
<tr><td>have seen, a German translation had been published in i860. </td></tr>
<tr><td>In a letter to Mr. Murray (September 10, 1861), he wrote, </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� My book seems exciting much attention in Germany, </td></tr>
<tr><td>judging from the number of discussions sent me.��� The </td></tr>
<tr><td>silence had been broken, and in a few years the voice of </td></tr>
<tr><td>German science was to become one of the strongest of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>advocates of evolution. </td></tr>
<tr><td>During all the early part of the year (1861) he was working </td></tr>
<tr><td>at the mass of details which are marshalled in order in the early </td></tr>

<tr><td>from what was then the main body of the town, and not far </td></tr>
<tr><td>from the beautiful cliffed coast-line in the neighbourhood of </td></tr>
<tr><td>Anstey���s Cove. </td></tr>
<tr><td>During the Torquay holiday, and for the remainder of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>year, he worked at the fertilisation of orchids. This part of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the year 1861 is not dealt with in the present chapter, because </td></tr>

<tr><td>reason, that after repeated trials I find I cannot correct my </td></tr>
<tr><td>own style till I see the MS. in type. Some are born with a </td></tr>
<tr><td>power of good writing, like Wallace ; others like myself and </td></tr>
<tr><td>Lyell have to labour very hard and slowly at every sentence. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I find it a very good plan, when I cannot get a difficult </td></tr>
<tr><td>discussion to please me, to fancy that some one comes into </td></tr>
<tr><td>the room and asks me what I am doing ; and then try at </td></tr>

<tr><td>facts and reasonings on variation, and on the segregation of </td></tr>
<tr><td>complete and semi-complete species, is not really more, or </td></tr>
<tr><td>at least as valuable, a part. I never conceived the process </td></tr>
<tr><td>nearly so clearly before ; one feels present at the creation of </td></tr>
<tr><td>new forms. I wish, however, you had enlarged a little more </td></tr>
<tr><td>on the pairing of similar varieties; a rather more numerous </td></tr>

<tr><td>varieties of one species ; other mi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>mickers are undoubtedly distinct </td></tr>
<tr><td>species, or even distinct genera. </td></tr>
<tr><td>So again, some of the mimicked </td></tr>
<tr><td>forms can be shown to be merely </td></tr>
<tr><td>varieties ; but the greater number </td></tr>
<tr><td>must be ranked as distinct species. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Hence the creationist will have to </td></tr>
<tr><td>admit that some of these forms </td></tr>
<tr><td>have become imitators, by means </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the laws of variation, whilst </td></tr>
<tr><td>others he must look at as separately </td></tr>
<tr><td>created under their present guise ; </td></tr>

<tr><td>as we now see them, but due to the </td></tr>

<tr><td>class, for when possible the facts have been verified on the </td></tr>

<tr><td>worn off. But certainly the aggregation of the evidence </td></tr>
<tr><td>produced a very striking effect on my mind. The chapter </td></tr>
<tr><td>comparing language and changes of species, seems most </td></tr>
<tr><td>ingenious and interesting. He has shown great skill in </td></tr>
<tr><td>picking out salient points in the argument for change of </td></tr>
<tr><td>species ; but I am deeply disappointed (I do not mean </td></tr>
<tr><td>personally) to find that his timidity prevents him giving </td></tr>
<tr><td>any judgment . . . From all my communications with him </td></tr>
<tr><td>I must ever think that he has really entirely lost faith in </td></tr>
<tr><td>the immutability of species ; and yet one of his strongest </td></tr>
<tr><td>sentences is nearly as follows : ��� If it should ever f be </td></tr>
<tr><td>rendered highly probable that species change by variation </td></tr>
<tr><td>and natural selection,��� &c. &c. I had hoped he would have </td></tr>

<tr><td>after the beginning of the illness in the previous autumn) his </td></tr>
<tr><td>health took a turn for the better. As soon as he was able </td></tr>
<tr><td>to do any work, he began to write his papers on Lythrum, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and on Climbing Plants, so that the work which now con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>cerns us did not begin until September, when he again set to </td></tr>
<tr><td>work on ��� Animals and Plants.��� A letter to Sir J. D. Hooker </td></tr>
<tr><td>gives some account of the re-commencement of the work : </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� I have begun looking over my old MS., and it is as fresh </td></tr>
<tr><td>as if I had never written it ; parts are astonishingly dull, but </td></tr>
<tr><td>yet worth printing, I think ; and other parts strike me as very </td></tr>
<tr><td>good. I am a complete millionaire in odd and curious little </td></tr>
<tr><td>facts, and I have been really astounded at my own industry </td></tr>
<tr><td>whilst reading my chapters on Inheritance and Selection. </td></tr>
<tr><td>God knows when the book will ever be completed, for I find </td></tr>
<tr><td>that I am very weak and on my best days cannot do more </td></tr>

<tr><td>Royal Society. It is presented at the Anniversary Meeting </td></tr>
<tr><td>on St Andrew���s Day (Nov. 30), the medallist being usually </td></tr>
<tr><td>present to receive it, but this the state of my father���s health </td></tr>
<tr><td>prevented. He wrote to Mr. Fox on this subject: ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>"I was glad to see your hand-writing. The Copley, </td></tr>
<tr><td>being open to all sciences and all the world, is reckoned a </td></tr>

<tr><td>Natural Selection is making some progress in this country, and </td></tr>

<tr><td>To Sir J. D. Hooker, also, he wrote : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� How kind you have been about this medal ; indeed, I am </td></tr>
<tr><td>blessed with many good friends, and I have received four or </td></tr>

<tr><td>��� I must and will answer you, for it is a real pleasure for me </td></tr>
<tr><td>to thank you cordially for your note. Such notes as this of </td></tr>

<tr><td>(��� Life,��� vol. ii. p. 384), speaks of the supposed malcontents as </td></tr>
<tr><td>being afraid to crown anything so unorthodox as the ��� Origin.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>But he adds that if such were their feelings ��� they had the </td></tr>
<tr><td>good sense to draw in their horns.��� It appears, however, from </td></tr>

<tr><td>I infer from H. Spencer continually using the words, natural </td></tr>
<tr><td>selection. I formerly thought, probably in an exaggerated </td></tr>
<tr><td>degree, that it was a great advantage to bring into connection </td></tr>
<tr><td>natural and artificial selection ; this indeed led me to use a </td></tr>

<tr><td>of course send you a copy. I will use the term in my next </td></tr>
<tr><td>book on Domestic Animals, &c., from which, by the way, I </td></tr>

<tr><td>Natural Selection has now been so largely used abroad and </td></tr>
<tr><td>at home, that I doubt whether it could be given up, and with </td></tr>
<tr><td>all its faults I should be sorry to see the attempt made. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Whether it will be rejected must now depend ��� on the survival </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the fittest.��� As in time the term must grow intelligible </td></tr>
<tr><td>the objections to its use will grow weaker and weaker. I </td></tr>
<tr><td>doubt whether the use of any term would have made the </td></tr>
<tr><td>subject intelligible to some minds, clear as it is to others; </td></tr>
<tr><td>for do we not see even to the present day Malthus on Popu- </td></tr>

<tr><td>take in writing to you. I have just read, though imperfectly, </td></tr>
<tr><td>your * Entstehung und Begriff,��� and .have been so greatly </td></tr>
<tr><td>interested by it, that I have sent it to be translated, as I am </td></tr>
<tr><td>a poor German scholar. I have just finished a new [4th] </td></tr>

<tr><td>and my object in writing to you is to say that if you should </td></tr>
<tr><td>see this edition you would think that I had borrowed from </td></tr>

<tr><td>dare say I have not been cautious in expressing myself. The </td></tr>
<tr><td>remark which has struck me most, is that on the position of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the leaves not having been acquired through natural selection, </td></tr>
<tr><td>from not being of any special importance to the plant. I </td></tr>
<tr><td>well remember being formerly troubled by an analogous </td></tr>
<tr><td>difficulty, namely, the position of the ovules, their anatropous </td></tr>
<tr><td>condition, &c. It was owing to forgetfulness that I did not </td></tr>
<tr><td>notice this difficulty in the ���Origin.��� Although I can offer </td></tr>
<tr><td>no explanation of such facts, and only hope to see that they </td></tr>
<tr><td>may be explained, yet I hardly see how they support the </td></tr>
<tr><td>doctrine of some law of necessary development, for it is not </td></tr>
<tr><td>clear to me that a plant, with its leaves placed at some </td></tr>
<tr><td>particular angle, or with its ovules in some particular position, </td></tr>
<tr><td>thus stands higher than another plant. But I must apologise </td></tr>
<tr><td>for troubling you with these remarks. </td></tr>

<tr><td>���With respect to Governor Eyre���s conduct in Jamaica, he </td></tr>
<tr><td>felt strongly that J. S. Mill was right in prosecuting him. I </td></tr>
<tr><td>remember one evening, at my Uncle���s, we were talking on the </td></tr>

<tr><td>some foolish remark about the prosecutors spending the </td></tr>
<tr><td>surplus of the fund in a dinner. My father turned on me </td></tr>
<tr><td>almost with fury, and told me, if those were my feelings, I </td></tr>
<tr><td>had better go back to Southampton ; the inhabitants having </td></tr>
<tr><td>given a dinner to Governor Eyre on his landing, but with </td></tr>
<tr><td>which I had had nothing to do." The end of the incident, </td></tr>
<tr><td>as told by my brother, is so characteristic of my father that I </td></tr>
<tr><td>cannot resist giving it, though it has no bearing on the point </td></tr>
<tr><td>at issue. ��� Next morning at 7 o���clock, or so, he came into </td></tr>
<tr><td>my bedroom and sat on my bed, and said that he had not </td></tr>
<tr><td>been able to sleep, from the thought that he had been so </td></tr>
<tr><td>angry with me, and after a few more kind words he left me.��� </td></tr>

<tr><td>quote from some notes by Rev. J. Brodie Innes : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� Allied to the extreme carefulness of observation was his </td></tr>

<tr><td>sion, when a parish meeting had been held on some disputed </td></tr>
<tr><td>point of no great importance, I was surprised by a visit from </td></tr>
<tr><td>Mr. Darwin at night. He came to say that, thinking over </td></tr>
<tr><td>the debate, though what he had said was quite accurate, he </td></tr>
<tr><td>thought I might have drawn an erroneous conclusion, and he </td></tr>
<tr><td>would not sleep till he had explained it I believe that if on </td></tr>

<tr><td>��� He subscribed ,��10. </td></tr>
<tr><td>54 SPREAD OF EVOLUTION. [1866. </td></tr>
<tr><td>This tallies with my father���s habits, as described by him- </td></tr>
<tr><td>self. When a difficulty or an objection occurred to him, </td></tr>
<tr><td>he thought it of paramount importance to make a note of </td></tr>
<tr><td>it instantly, because he found hostile facts to be especially </td></tr>
<tr><td>evanescent. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The same point is illustrated by the following incident, for </td></tr>
<tr><td>which I am indebted to Mr. Romanes : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� I have always remembered the following little incident as </td></tr>
<tr><td>a good example of Mr. Darwin���s extreme solicitude on the </td></tr>
<tr><td>score of accuracy. One evening at Down there was a </td></tr>
<tr><td>general conversation upon the difficulty of explaining the </td></tr>
<tr><td>evolution of some of the distinctively human emotions, espe- </td></tr>
<tr><td>cially those appertaining to the recognition of beauty in </td></tr>
<tr><td>natural scenery. I suggested a view of my own upon the </td></tr>
<tr><td>subject, which, depending upon the principle of association, </td></tr>
<tr><td>required the supposition that a long line of ancestors should </td></tr>
<tr><td>have inhabited regions, the scenery of which is now re- </td></tr>
<tr><td>garded as beautiful. Just as I was about to observe that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>chief difficulty attaching to my hypothesis arose from </td></tr>
<tr><td>feelings of the sublime (seeing that these are associated with </td></tr>
<tr><td>awe, and might therefore be expected not to be agreeable), </td></tr>
<tr><td>Mr. Darwin anticipated the remark, by asking how the </td></tr>
<tr><td>hypothesis was to meet the case of these feelings. In the </td></tr>
<tr><td>conversation which followed, he said the occasion in his own </td></tr>
<tr><td>life, when he was most affected by the emotions of the sublime </td></tr>
<tr><td>was when he stood upon one of the summits of the Cordillera, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and surveyed the magnificent prospect all around. It seemed, </td></tr>
<tr><td>as he quaintly observed, as if his nerves had become fiddle- </td></tr>
<tr><td>strings, and had all taken to rapidly vibrating. This remark </td></tr>
<tr><td>was only made incidentally, and the conversation passed into </td></tr>
<tr><td>some other branch. About an hour afterwards Mr. Darwin </td></tr>
<tr><td>retired to rest, while I sat up in the smoking-room with one </td></tr>
<tr><td>of his sons. We continued smoking and talking for several </td></tr>
<tr><td>hours, when at about one o���clock in the morning the door </td></tr>
<tr><td>gently opened and Mr. Darwin appeared, in his slippers and </td></tr>

<tr><td>are the words he used : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� ' Since I went to bed I have been thinking over our con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>versation in the drawing-room, and it has just occurred to me </td></tr>
<tr><td>that I was wrong in telling you I felt most of the sublime </td></tr>
<tr><td>when on the top of the Cordillera ; I am quite sure that I </td></tr>
<tr><td>felt it even more when in the forests of Brazil. I thought it </td></tr>
<tr><td>best to come and tell you this at once in case I should be </td></tr>
<tr><td>putting you wrong. I am sure now that I felt most sublime </td></tr>
<tr><td>in the forests.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� This was all he had come' to say, and it was evident </td></tr>
<tr><td>that he had come to do so, because he thought that the fact </td></tr>
<tr><td>of his feeling ��� most sublime in forests ��� was more in accord- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ance with the hypothesis which we had been discussing, than </td></tr>
<tr><td>the fact which he had previously stated. Now, as no one knew </td></tr>
<tr><td>better than Mr. Darwin the difference between a speculation </td></tr>
<tr><td>and a fact, I thought this little exhibition of scientific con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>scientiousness very noteworthy, where the only question </td></tr>
<tr><td>concerned was of so highly speculative a character. I should </td></tr>
<tr><td>not have been so much impressed if he had thought that by </td></tr>
<tr><td>his temporary failure of memory he had put me on a wrong </td></tr>
<tr><td>scent in any matter of fact, although even in such a case he </td></tr>
<tr><td>is the only man I ever knew who would care to get out of </td></tr>
<tr><td>bed at such a time of night in order to make the correction </td></tr>
<tr><td>immediately, instead of waiting till next morning. But as </td></tr>

<tr><td>Dear Sir, ��� Will you excuse my venturing to ask you a </td></tr>
<tr><td>question, to which no one���s answer but your own would be </td></tr>
<tr><td>quite satisfactory ? </td></tr>
<tr><td>Do you consider the holding of your theory of Natural </td></tr>
<tr><td>Selection, in its fullest and most unreserved sense, to be </td></tr>
<tr><td>inconsistent ��� I do not say with any particular scheme of </td></tr>
<tr><td>theological doctrine ��� but with the following belief, namely : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>That knowledge is given to man by the direct inspiration </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the Spirit of God. </td></tr>
<tr><td>That God is a personal and Infinitely good Being. </td></tr>
<tr><td>That the effect of the action of the Spirit of God on the </td></tr>
<tr><td>brain of man is especially a moral effect. </td></tr>
<tr><td>And that each individual man has within certain limits </td></tr>
<tr><td>a power of choice as to how far he will yield to his hereditary </td></tr>
<tr><td>animal impulses, and how far he will rather follow the </td></tr>
<tr><td>guidance of the Spirit, who is educating him into a power of </td></tr>
<tr><td>resisting those impulses in obedience to moral motives ? </td></tr>
<tr><td>The reason why I ask you is this : my own impression has </td></tr>
<tr><td>always been, not only that your theory was perfectly com- </td></tr>
<tr><td>patible with the faith to which I have just tried to give </td></tr>
<tr><td>expression, but that your books afforded me a clue which </td></tr>
<tr><td>would guide me in applying that faith to the solution of </td></tr>
<tr><td>certain complicated psychological problems which it was </td></tr>
<tr><td>of practical importance to me as a mother to solve. I felt </td></tr>
<tr><td>that you had supplied one of the missing links ��� not to say </td></tr>
<tr><td>the missing link ��� between the facts of science and the pro- </td></tr>
<tr><td>mises of religion. Every year's experience tends to deepen </td></tr>
<tr><td>in me that impression. </td></tr>
<tr><td>But I have lately read remarks on the probable bearing of </td></tr>
<tr><td>your theory on religious and moral questions which have </td></tr>
<tr><td>perplexed and pained me sorely. I know that the persons </td></tr>
<tr><td>who make such remarks must be cleverer and wiser than </td></tr>

<tr><td>the humblest student of my works should apply to me </td></tr>
<tr><td>directly in a difficulty, than that she should puzzle too long </td></tr>
<tr><td>over adverse and probably mistaken or thoughtless criticisms. </td></tr>
<tr><td>At the same time I feel that you have a perfect right to </td></tr>
<tr><td>refuse to answer such questions as I have asked you. Science </td></tr>
<tr><td>must take her path, and Theology hers, and they will meet </td></tr>
<tr><td>when and where and how God pleases, and you are in no </td></tr>

<tr><td>first adherents of the new faith as more or less popular </td></tr>
<tr><td>writers, not especially likely to advance its acceptance with </td></tr>
<tr><td>the professorial or purely scientific world. And he claims for </td></tr>
<tr><td>Haeckel that it was his advocacy of Evolution in his * Radio- </td></tr>
<tr><td>laria��� (1862), and at the ��� Versammlung��� of Naturalists at </td></tr>
<tr><td>Stettin in 1863, that placed the Darwinian question for the </td></tr>

<tr><td>his enthusiastic propagandism that chiefly contributed to its </td></tr>
<tr><td>success. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Mr. Huxley, writing in 1869, paid a high tribute to </td></tr>

<tr><td>ment in Germany. Of his * Generelle Morphologie,��� ��� an </td></tr>

<tr><td>it is certain, that the degree of sterility of the individuals A </td></tr>
<tr><td>and B will vary, but any such extra-sterile individuals of, we </td></tr>
<tr><td>will say A, if they should hereafter breed with other indi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>viduals of A, will bequeath no advantage to their progeny, by </td></tr>
<tr><td>which these families will tend to increase in number over </td></tr>

<tr><td>should like to write more than I can. The great leading </td></tr>

<tr><td>will have been modified more than the body ; yet I had got </td></tr>
<tr><td>as far as to see with you, that the struggle between the races </td></tr>
<tr><td>of man depended entirely on intellectual and moral qualities. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The latter part of the paper I can designate only as grand </td></tr>
<tr><td>and most eloquently done. I have shown your paper to two </td></tr>
<tr><td>or three persons who have been here, and they have been </td></tr>
<tr><td>equally struck with it I am not sure that I go with you on </td></tr>
<tr><td>all minor points : when reading Sir G. Grey���s account of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>constant battles of Australian savages, I remember thinking </td></tr>
<tr><td>that natural selection would come in, and likewise with the </td></tr>
<tr><td>Esquimaux, with whom the art of fishing and managing canoes </td></tr>
<tr><td>is said to be hereditary. I rather differ on the rank, under </td></tr>

<tr><td>used for the higher divisions. Ants would not be separated </td></tr>
<tr><td>from other hymenopterous insects, however high the instinct </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the one, and however low the instincts of the other. With </td></tr>
<tr><td>respect to the differences of race, a conjecture has occurred </td></tr>
<tr><td>to me that much may be due to the correlation of complexion </td></tr>
<tr><td>(and consequently hair) with constitution. Assume that a </td></tr>
<tr><td>dusky individual best escaped miasma, and you will readily </td></tr>
<tr><td>see what I mean. I persuaded the Director-General of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>Medical Department of the Army to send printed forms to </td></tr>
<tr><td>the surgeons of all regiments in tropical countries to ascertain </td></tr>
<tr><td>this point, but I dare say I shall never get any returns. </td></tr>

<tr><td>capable of treating the subject well, and my sole reason for </td></tr>

<tr><td>reasons. Firstly, to thank you for your letter about your </td></tr>
<tr><td>baby, which has quite charmed both me and my wife; I </td></tr>
<tr><td>heartily congratulate you on its birth. I remember being </td></tr>
<tr><td>surprised in my own case how soon the paternal instincts </td></tr>
<tr><td>became developed, and in you they seem to be unusually </td></tr>
<tr><td>strong, ... I hope the large blue eyes and the principles of </td></tr>
<tr><td>inheritance will make your child as good a naturalist as you </td></tr>
<tr><td>are ; but, judging from my own experience, you will be </td></tr>
<tr><td>astonished to find how the whole mental disposition of your </td></tr>
<tr><td>children changes with advancing years. A young child, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>the same when nearly grown, sometimes differ almost as much </td></tr>
<tr><td>as do a caterpillar and butterfly. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The second point is to congratulate you on the projected </td></tr>
<tr><td>translation of your great work* about which I heard from </td></tr>
<tr><td>Huxley last Sunday. I am heartily glad of it, but how it has </td></tr>
<tr><td>been brought about, I know not, for a friend who supported </td></tr>
<tr><td>the proposed translation at Norwich, told me he thought </td></tr>
<tr><td>there would be no chance of it Huxley tells me that you </td></tr>
<tr><td>consent to omit and shorten some parts, and I am confident </td></tr>
<tr><td>that this is very wise. As I know your object is to instruct </td></tr>
<tr><td>the public, you will assuredly thus get many more readers </td></tr>
<tr><td>in England. Indeed, I believe that almost every book </td></tr>
<tr><td>would be improved by condensation. I have been reading a </td></tr>
<tr><td>good deal of your last book,f and the style is beautifully </td></tr>
<tr><td>clear and easy to me; but why it should differ so much </td></tr>
<tr><td>in this respect from your great work I cannot imagine. I </td></tr>

<tr><td>and full of original thought. Your boldness, however, </td></tr>
<tr><td>sometimes makes me tremble, but as Huxley remarked, </td></tr>
<tr><td>some one must be bold enough to make a beginning in </td></tr>
<tr><td>drawing up tables of descent. Although you fully admit the </td></tr>
<tr><td>imperfection of the geological record, yet Huxley agreed with </td></tr>
<tr><td>me in thinking that you are sometimes rather rash in venturing </td></tr>
<tr><td>to say at what periods the several groups first appeared. I have </td></tr>
<tr><td>this advantage over you, that I remember how wonderfully </td></tr>

<tr><td>at the end longer than the old ; though in one part nine pages </td></tr>

<tr><td>enough that females should be produced from the males </td></tr>
<tr><td>with red feathers, which should be destitute of red feathers ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>but these females must have a latent tendency to produce </td></tr>
<tr><td>such feathers, otherwise they would cause deterioration </td></tr>
<tr><td>in the red head-feathers of their male offspring. Such </td></tr>
<tr><td>124 WORK ON ���MAN.��� [187a </td></tr>
<tr><td>latent tendency would be shown by their producing the </td></tr>
<tr><td>red feathers when old, or diseased in their ovaria. But </td></tr>
<tr><td>I have no difficulty in making the whole head red if the </td></tr>
<tr><td>few red feathers in the male from the first tended to be </td></tr>
<tr><td>sexually transmitted. I am quite willing to admit that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>female may have been modified, either at the same time </td></tr>
<tr><td>or subsequently, for protection by the accumulation of varia- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tions limited in their transmission to the female sex. I owe to </td></tr>
<tr><td>your writings the consideration of this latter point But I </td></tr>
<tr><td>cannot yet persuade myself that females alone have often </td></tr>
<tr><td>been modified for protection. Should you grudge the trouble </td></tr>
<tr><td>briefly to tell me, whether you believe that the plainer head </td></tr>
<tr><td>and less bright colours of ? chaffinch* the less red on the head </td></tr>
<tr><td>and less clean colours of ? goldfinch, the much less red on </td></tr>
<tr><td>the breast of ? bullfinch, the paler crest of golden-crested </td></tr>

<tr><td>and by other means too long to specify ; but I earnestly wish </td></tr>

<tr><td>that in this latter case the marriages of cousins might be </td></tr>
<tr><td>discouraged. If the proper queries are inserted, the returns </td></tr>
<tr><td>would show whether married cousins have in their households </td></tr>
<tr><td>on the night of the census as many children as have parents </td></tr>
<tr><td>who are not related ; and should the number prove fewer, we </td></tr>
<tr><td>might safely infer either lessened fertility in the parents, or </td></tr>

<tr><td>of a former state of things, I have retained in the foregoing </td></tr>
<tr><td>paragraphs and also elsewhere, several sentences which imply </td></tr>
<tr><td>that naturalists believe in the separate creation of each </td></tr>

<tr><td>have seen no reason to change my mind, but then I must add </td></tr>

<tr><td>l6l </td></tr>
<tr><td>through ray mind of late years. In North America, in going </td></tr>
<tr><td>from north to south or from east to west, it is clear that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>changed conditions of life have modified the organisms in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>different regions, so that they now form distinct races or even </td></tr>
<tr><td>species. It is further clear that in isolated districts, however </td></tr>
<tr><td>small, the inhabitants almost always get slightly modified, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>how far this is due to the nature of the slightly different </td></tr>
<tr><td>conditions to which they are exposed, and how far to mere </td></tr>
<tr><td>interbreeding, in the manner explained by Weismann, I can </td></tr>
<tr><td>form no opinion. The same difficulty occurred to me (as </td></tr>
<tr><td>shown in my ���Variation of Animals and Plants under Domesti- </td></tr>
<tr><td>cation ') with respect to the aboriginal breeds of cattle, sheep, </td></tr>
<tr><td>&c., in the separated districts of Great Britain, and indeed </td></tr>
<tr><td>throughout Europe. As our knowledge advances, very slight </td></tr>
<tr><td>differences, considered by systematists as of no importance </td></tr>
<tr><td>in structure, are continually found to be functionally im- </td></tr>
<tr><td>portant ; and I have been especially struck with this fact in </td></tr>
<tr><td>the case of plants to which my observations have of late years </td></tr>
<tr><td>been confined. Therefore it seems to me rather rash to </td></tr>
<tr><td>consider the slight differences between representative species, </td></tr>
<tr><td>for instance those inhabiting the different islands of the same </td></tr>
<tr><td>archipelago, as of no functional importance, and as not in any </td></tr>
<tr><td>way due to natural selection. With respect to all adopted </td></tr>
<tr><td>structures, and these are innumerable, I cannot see how M. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Wagner's view throws any light, nor indeed do I see at all </td></tr>
<tr><td>more clearly than I did before, from the numerous cases </td></tr>
<tr><td>which he has brought forward, how and why it is that a long </td></tr>
<tr><td>isolated form should almost always become slightly modified. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I do not know whether you will care about hearing my </td></tr>

<tr><td>(which is improbable in the highest degree), the slowly, more </td></tr>
<tr><td>or less, modifying offspring must intercross one with another, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and with their unmodified parents, and any offspring not as </td></tr>
<tr><td>yet modified. The case will then be like that of domesticated </td></tr>

<tr><td>My DEAR WALLACE, ��� I have at last finished the gigantic </td></tr>
<tr><td>job of reading Dr. Bastian���s book,* and have been deeply </td></tr>
<tr><td>interested by it You wished to hear my impression, but it </td></tr>
<tr><td>is not worth sending. </td></tr>
<tr><td>He seems to me an extremely able man, as, indeed, I </td></tr>
<tr><td>thought when I read his first essay. His general argument </td></tr>
<tr><td>in favour of Archebiosis f is wonderfully strong, though I </td></tr>
<tr><td>cannot think much of some few of his arguments. The result </td></tr>
<tr><td>is that I am bewildered and astonished by his statements, but </td></tr>
<tr><td>am not convinced, though, on the whole, it seems to me pro- </td></tr>
<tr><td>bable that Archebiosis is true. I am not convinced, partly </td></tr>
<tr><td>I think owing to the deductive cast of much of his reasoning ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>and I know not why, but I never feel convinced by deduction, </td></tr>
<tr><td>even in the case of H. Spencer���s writings. If Dr. Bastian���s </td></tr>
<tr><td>book had been turned upside down, and he had begun with </td></tr>
<tr><td>the various cases of Heterogenesis, and then gone on to </td></tr>
<tr><td>organic, and afterwards to saline solutions, and had then given </td></tr>
<tr><td>his general arguments, I should have been, I believe, much </td></tr>
<tr><td>more influenced. I suspect, however, that my chief difficulty </td></tr>
<tr><td>is the effect of old convictions being stereotyped on my brain. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I must have more evidence that germs, or the minutest frag- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ments of the lowest forms, are always killed by 212��� of Fahr. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Perhaps the mere reiteration of the statements given by </td></tr>
<tr><td>Dr. Bastian [of] other men, whose judgment I respect, and who </td></tr>
<tr><td>have worked long on the lower organisms, would suffice to </td></tr>
<tr><td>convince me. Here is a fine confession of intellectual weak- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ness ; but what an inexplicable frame of mind is that of </td></tr>
<tr><td>belief 1 </td></tr>

<tr><td>1872.] 'BEGINNINGS OF LIFE.��� 169 </td></tr>
<tr><td>ated, my mind can no more digest such statements, whether </td></tr>
<tr><td>true or false, than my stomach can digest a lump of lead. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Dr. Bastian is always comparing Archebiosis, as well as </td></tr>
<tr><td>growth, to crystallisation ; but, on this view, a Rotifer or Tardi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>grade is adapted to its humble conditions of life by a happy </td></tr>
<tr><td>accident, and this I cannot believe. . . . He must have </td></tr>
<tr><td>worked with very impure materials in some cases, as plenty </td></tr>
<tr><td>of organisms appeared in a saline solution not containing an </td></tr>
<tr><td>atom of nitrogen. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I wholly disagree with Dr. Bastian about many points in </td></tr>
<tr><td>his latter chapters. Thus the frequency of generalised forms </td></tr>
<tr><td>in the older strata seems to me clearly to indicate the common </td></tr>
<tr><td>descent with divergence of more recent forms. Notwith- </td></tr>
<tr><td>standing all his sneers, I do not strike my colours as yet about </td></tr>
<tr><td>Fangenesis. I should like to live to see Archebiosis proved </td></tr>
<tr><td>true, for it would be a discovery of transcendent importance ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>or, if false, I should like to see��� it disproved, and the facts </td></tr>
<tr><td>otherwise explained ; but I shall not live to see all this. If </td></tr>
<tr><td>ever proved, Dr. Bastian will have taken a prominent part in </td></tr>
<tr><td>the work. How grand is the onward rush of science; it is </td></tr>
<tr><td>enough to console us for the many errors which we have com- </td></tr>
<tr><td>mitted, and for our efforts being overlaid and forgotten in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>mass of new facts and new views which are daily turning up. </td></tr>

<tr><td>anything more original and interesting than your treatment </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the causes which favour the development of scientific men. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The whole was quite new to me, and most curious. When </td></tr>
<tr><td>I began your essay I was afraid that you were going to attack </td></tr>
<tr><td>the principle of inheritance in relation to mind, but I soon </td></tr>
<tr><td>found myself fully content to follow you and accept your </td></tr>
<tr><td>limitations. I have felt, of course, special interest in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>latter part of your work, but there was here less novelty to </td></tr>
<tr><td>me. In many parts you do me much honour, and every- </td></tr>
<tr><td>where more than justice. Authors generally like to hear what </td></tr>
<tr><td>points most strike different readers, so I will mention that of </td></tr>
<tr><td>your shorter essays, that on the future prevalence of lan- </td></tr>
<tr><td>guages, and on vaccination interested me the most, as, indeed, </td></tr>
<tr><td>did that on statistics, and free will. Great liability to certain </td></tr>
<tr><td>diseases, being probably liable to atavism, is quite a new idea </td></tr>
<tr><td>to me. At p. 322 you suggest that a young swallow ought to </td></tr>
<tr><td>be separated, and then let loose in order to test the power </td></tr>
<tr><td>of instinct ; but nature annually performs this experiment, </td></tr>
<tr><td>as old cuckoos migrate in England some weeks before the </td></tr>
<tr><td>young birds of the same year. By the way, I have just used </td></tr>
<tr><td>the forbidden word ���nature," which, after reading your </td></tr>
<tr><td>essay, I almost determined never to use again. There </td></tr>
<tr><td>are very few remarks in your book to which I demur, but </td></tr>
<tr><td>when you back up Asa Gray in saying that all instincts are </td></tr>
<tr><td>congenital habits, I must protest. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Finally, will you permit me to ask you a question : have </td></tr>
<tr><td>you yourself, or [has] some one who can be quite trusted, </td></tr>
<tr><td>observed (p. 322) that the butterflies on the Alps are tamer </td></tr>
<tr><td>than those on the lowlands ? Do they belong to the same </td></tr>
<tr><td>species? Has this fact been observed with more than one </td></tr>
<tr><td>species ? Are they brightly coloured kinds ? I am especially </td></tr>
<tr><td>curious about their alighting on the brightly coloured parts </td></tr>
<tr><td>of ladies��� dresses, more especially because I have been more </td></tr>
<tr><td>than once assured that butterflies like bright colours, for </td></tr>
<tr><td>instance, in India the scarlet leaves of Fointsettia. </td></tr>

<tr><td>ledge on coral reefs. I have very little to say on the subject, </td></tr>
<tr><td>even if I had formerly read your account and seen your maps, </td></tr>
<tr><td>but had known nothing of the proofs of recent elevation, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and of your belief that the islands have not since subsided. I </td></tr>
<tr><td>have no doubt that I should have considered them as formed </td></tr>
<tr><td>during subsidence. But I should have been much troubled </td></tr>
<tr><td>in my mind by the sea not being so deep as it usually is </td></tr>
<tr><td>round atolls, and by the reef on one side sloping so gradually </td></tr>
<tr><td>beneath the sea ; for this latter fact, as far as my memory </td></tr>
<tr><td>serves me, is a very unusual and almost unparalleled case. I </td></tr>
<tr><td>always foresaw that a bank at the proper depth beneath the </td></tr>
<tr><td>surface would give rise to a reef which could not be distin- </td></tr>
<tr><td>guished from an atoll, formed during subsidence. I must </td></tr>
<tr><td>still adhere to my opinion, that the atolls and barrier reefs in </td></tr>

<tr><td>the Pellew Islands, if of at all frequent occurrence, would </td></tr>
<tr><td>make my general conclusions of very little value. Future </td></tr>
<tr><td>observers must decide between us. It will be a strange fact </td></tr>
<tr><td>if there has not been subsidence of the beds of the great </td></tr>

<tr><td>paper before the Royal Society of Edinburgh, April 5, 1880.* </td></tr>
<tr><td>The chief point brought forward is the possibility of the </td></tr>

<tr><td>known of the multitude of minute oceanic organisms. I </td></tr>
<tr><td>rejected this view, as from the few dredgings made in the </td></tr>

<tr><td>the smaller corals, &c., decayed, and were dissolved, when not </td></tr>
<tr><td>protected by the deposition of sediment, and sediment could </td></tr>

<tr><td>suggestions, and the whole profoundly interesting. I have </td></tr>
<tr><td>seldom been more gratified than by [your] honourable mention </td></tr>
<tr><td>of my work. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I should like to tell you one little observation which I </td></tr>
<tr><td>made with care many years ago ; I saw ants ( Formica rufa) </td></tr>
<tr><td>carrying cocoons from a nest which was the largest I ever saw </td></tr>
<tr><td>and which was well known to all the country people near, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>an old man, apparently about eighty years of age, told me </td></tr>
<tr><td>that he had known it ever since he was a boy. The ants </td></tr>
<tr><td>carrying the cocoons did not appear to be emigrating; </td></tr>
<tr><td>following the line, I saw many ascending a tall fir-tree still </td></tr>
<tr><td>carrying their cocoons. But when I looked closely I found </td></tr>
<tr><td>that all the cocoons were empty cases. This astonished me, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and next day I got a man to observe with me, and we again </td></tr>
<tr><td>saw ants bringing empty cocoons out of the nest ; each of us </td></tr>
<tr><td>fixed on one ant and slowly followed it, and repeated the </td></tr>
<tr><td>observation on many others. We thus found that some ants </td></tr>
<tr><td>soon dropped their empty cocoons ; others carried them for </td></tr>
<tr><td>many yards, as much as thirty paces, and others carried them </td></tr>
<tr><td>high up the fir-tree out of sight Now here I think we have </td></tr>
<tr><td>one instinct in contest with another and mistaken one. The </td></tr>
<tr><td>first instinct being to carry the empty cocoons out of the nest, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and it would have been sufficient to have laid them on the </td></tr>
<tr><td>heap of rubbish, as the first breath of wind would have blown </td></tr>
<tr><td>them away. And then came in the contest with the other </td></tr>
<tr><td>very powerful instinct of preserving and carrying their </td></tr>
<tr><td>cocoons as long as possible ; and this they could not help </td></tr>
<tr><td>doing although the cocoons were empty. According as the </td></tr>
<tr><td>one or other instinct was the stronger in each individual ant, </td></tr>
<tr><td>so did it carry the empty cocoon to a greater or less distance. </td></tr>
<tr><td>If this little observation should ever prove of any use to you, </td></tr>
<tr><td>you are quite at liberty to use it. Again thanking you </td></tr>

<tr><td>whole of your work.* I have long wished to know some- </td></tr>
<tr><td>thing about the views of the many great men whose doctrines </td></tr>
<tr><td>you give. With the exception of special points I did not </td></tr>
<tr><td>even understand H. Spencer���s general doctrine ; for his style </td></tr>

<tr><td>expositor (and therefore thinker) as you are ; and I think </td></tr>
<tr><td>that I understand nearly the whole ��� perhaps less clearly </td></tr>
<tr><td>about Cosmic Theism and Causation than other parts. It is </td></tr>

<tr><td>I wish some chemist would attempt to ascertain the result of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the cooling of heated gases of the proper kinds, in relation </td></tr>

<tr><td>me to find that here and there I had arrived from my own </td></tr>
<tr><td>crude thoughts at some of the same conclusions with you ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>though I could seldom or never have given my reasons for </td></tr>
<tr><td>such conclusions. I find that my mind is so fixed by the </td></tr>
<tr><td>inductive method, that I cannot appreciate deductive reason- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ing : I must begin with a good body of facts and not from a </td></tr>
<tr><td>principle (in which I always suspect some fallacy) and then </td></tr>

<tr><td>He seems to have found the work of correcting very </td></tr>

<tr><td>of reversion in this case ; but in a crude and imperfect manner. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I write now to call your attention to the sterility of moths </td></tr>

<tr><td>��� ��� Umwandlung. dcs AxolotL��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>1875 ] . VIVISECTION; 199 </td></tr>
<tr><td>p. 157, of English edition), and these cases illustrate, I think, </td></tr>
<tr><td>the sterility of Amblystoma. Would it not be worth while to </td></tr>
<tr><td>examine the reproductive organs of those individuals of wing- </td></tr>
<tr><td>less Hemiptera which occasionally have wings, as in the case </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the bed-bug? I think I have heard that the females of </td></tr>
<tr><td>Mutilla sometimes have wings. These cases must be due to </td></tr>
<tr><td>reversion. I dare say many anomalous cases will be hereafter </td></tr>
<tr><td>explained on the same principle. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I hinted at this explanation in the extraordinary case of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the black-shouldered peacock, the so-called Pavo nigripennis </td></tr>
<tr><td>given in my ��� Var. under Domest ; ��� and I might have been </td></tr>

<tr><td>THE VIVISECTION QUESTION. </td></tr>
<tr><td>[It was in November 1875 that my father gave his evidence </td></tr>
<tr><td>before the Royal Commission on Vivisection.* I have, there- </td></tr>
<tr><td>fore, placed together here the matter relating to this subject, </td></tr>
<tr><td>irrespective of date. Something has already been said of my </td></tr>
<tr><td>father���s strong feeling with regard to suffering f both in man </td></tr>
<tr><td>and beast It was indeed one of the strongest feelings in his </td></tr>
<tr><td>nature, and was exemplified in matters small and great, in </td></tr>
<tr><td>his sympathy with the educational miseries of dancing dogs, </td></tr>
<tr><td>or in his horror at the sufferings of slaves. </td></tr>
<tr><td>200 MISCELLANEA. [1875. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The remembrance of screams, or other sounds heard in </td></tr>
<tr><td>Brazil, when he was powerless to interfere with what he </td></tr>
<tr><td>believed to be the torture of a slave, haunted him for years, </td></tr>
<tr><td>especially at night. In smaller matters, where he could inter- </td></tr>
<tr><td>fere, he did so vigorously. He returned one day from his walk </td></tr>
<tr><td>pale and faint from having seen a horse ill-used, and from the </td></tr>
<tr><td>agitation of violently remonstrating with the man. On </td></tr>
<tr><td>another occasion he saw a horse-breaker teaching his son to </td></tr>
<tr><td>ride, the little boy was frightened and the man was rough ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>my father stopped, and jumping out of the carriage reproved </td></tr>
<tr><td>the man in no measured terms. </td></tr>
<tr><td>One other little incident may be mentioned, showing that </td></tr>
<tr><td>his humanity to animals was well known in his own neigh- </td></tr>
<tr><td>bourhood. A visitor, driving from Orpington to Down, told </td></tr>
<tr><td>the cabman to go faster. ���Why,��� said the man, ���if I had </td></tr>
<tr><td>whipped the horse this much, driving Mr. Darwin, he would </td></tr>
<tr><td>have got out of the carriage and abused me well.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>With respect to the special point under consideration, ��� the </td></tr>
<tr><td>sufferings of animals subjected to experiment, ��� nothing could </td></tr>
<tr><td>show a stronger feeling than the following extract from a </td></tr>
<tr><td>letter to Professor Ray Lankester (March 22, 1871) : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� You ask about my opinion on vivisection. I quite agree </td></tr>
<tr><td>that it is justifiable for real investigations on physiology ; but </td></tr>
<tr><td>not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a </td></tr>
<tr><td>subject which makes me sick with horror, so I will not say </td></tr>
<tr><td>another word about it, else I shall not sleep to-night" </td></tr>
<tr><td>An extract from Sir Thomas Farrer���s notes shows how </td></tr>
<tr><td>strongly he expressed himself in a similar manner in con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>versation : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� The last time I had any conversation with him was at my </td></tr>
<tr><td>house in Bryanston Square, just before one of his last seizures. </td></tr>
<tr><td>He was then deeply interested in the vivisection question ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>Some time afterwards the patient that he had undoubtedly been in- </td></tr>
<tr><td>was discharged, and wrote to thank sane when he wrote his former </td></tr>
<tr><td>my father for his interference, adding letter. </td></tr>
<tr><td>VIVISECTION. </td></tr>
<tr><td>18/50 </td></tr>
<tr><td>and what he said made a deep impression on me. He was a </td></tr>
<tr><td>man eminently fond of animals and tender to them ; he would </td></tr>
<tr><td>not knowingly have inflicted pain on a living creature ; but </td></tr>
<tr><td>he entertained the strongest opinion that to prohibit experi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ments on living animals, would be to put a stop to the know- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ledge of and the remedies for pain and disease." </td></tr>
<tr><td>The Anti- Vivisection agitation, to which the following </td></tr>
<tr><td>letters refer, seems to have become specially active in 1874, as </td></tr>
<tr><td>may be seen, eg. by the index to ���Nature��� for that year, in </td></tr>
<tr><td>which the word ��� Vivisection ��� suddenly comes into promi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>nence. But before that date the subject had received the </td></tr>
<tr><td>earnest attention of biologists. Thus at the Liverpool </td></tr>
<tr><td>Meeting of the British Association in 1870, a Committee </td></tr>
<tr><td>was appointed, whose report defined the circumstances and </td></tr>
<tr><td>conditions under which, in the opinion of the signatories, </td></tr>
<tr><td>experiments on living animals were justifiable. In the spring </td></tr>
<tr><td>of 1875, Lord Hartismere introduced a Bill into the Upper </td></tr>
<tr><td>House to regulate the course of physiological research. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Shortly afterwards a Bill more just towards science in its </td></tr>
<tr><td>provisions was introduced to the House of Commons by </td></tr>
<tr><td>Messrs. Lyon Playfair, Walpole, and Ashley. It was </td></tr>
<tr><td>however, withdrawn on the appointment of a Royal Com- </td></tr>
<tr><td>mission to inquire into the whole question. The Commis- </td></tr>
<tr><td>sioners were Lords Cardwell and Winmarleigh, Mr. W. E, </td></tr>
<tr><td>Forster, Sir J. B. Karslake, Mr. Huxley, Professor Erichssen, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and Mr. R. H. Hutton : they commenced their inquiry in </td></tr>
<tr><td>July, 1875, and the Report was published early in the follow- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ing year. </td></tr>
<tr><td>In the early summer of 1876, Lord Carnarvon���s Bill, </td></tr>
<tr><td>entitled, ��� An Act to amend the Law relating to Cruelty to </td></tr>
<tr><td>Animals,��� was introduced. It cannot be denied that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>framers of this Bill, yielding to the unreasonable clamour of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the public, went far beyond the recommendations of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>Royal Commission. As a correspondent in 1 Nature ��� put it </td></tr>

<tr><td>January 4, 1875. </td></tr>
<tr><td>My DEAR H. ��� Your letter has led me to think over vivisec- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tion (I wish some new word like anaes-section could be </td></tr>
<tr><td>invented t) for some hours, and I will jot down my conclu- </td></tr>
<tr><td>sions, which will appear very unsatisfactory to you. I have </td></tr>
<tr><td>long thought physiology one of the greatest of sciences, sure </td></tr>
<tr><td>sooner, or more probably later, greatly to benefit mankind ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>but, judging from all other sciences, the benefits will accrue </td></tr>
<tr><td>only indirectly in the search for abstract truth. It is certain </td></tr>
<tr><td>that physiology can progress only by experiments on living </td></tr>
<tr><td>animals. Therefore the proposal to limit research to points </td></tr>
<tr><td>of which we can now see the bearings in regard to health, &c., </td></tr>
<tr><td>I look at as puerile. I thought at first it would be good to </td></tr>
<tr><td>limit vivisection to public laboratories ; but I have heard only </td></tr>
<tr><td>of those in London and Cambridge, and I think Oxford ; but </td></tr>
<tr><td>probably there may be a .few others. Therefore only men </td></tr>
<tr><td>living in a few great towns would carry on investigation, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>this I should consider a great evil. If private men were per- </td></tr>
<tr><td>mitted to work in their own houses, and required a licence, I </td></tr>
<tr><td>do not see who is to determine whether any particular man </td></tr>
<tr><td>should receive one. It is young unknown men who are the </td></tr>

<tr><td>point Therefore I conclude, if (as is likely) some experi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ments have been tried too often, or anaesthetics have not been </td></tr>
<tr><td>used when they could have been, the cure must be in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>improvement of humanitarian feelings. Under this point of </td></tr>
<tr><td>view I have rejoiced at the present agitation. If stringent </td></tr>
<tr><td>laws are passed, and this is likely, seeing how unscientific the </td></tr>
<tr><td>House of Commons is, and that the gentlemen of England </td></tr>
<tr><td>are humane, as long as their sports are not considered, which </td></tr>
<tr><td>entail a hundred or thousand-fold more suffering than the </td></tr>
<tr><td>experiments of physiologists ��� if such laws are passed, the </td></tr>
<tr><td>result will assuredly be that physiology, which has been until </td></tr>
<tr><td>within the last few years at a standstill in England, will </td></tr>
<tr><td>languish or quite cease. It will then be carried on solely on </td></tr>
<tr><td>the Continent ; and there will be so many the fewer workers </td></tr>
<tr><td>on this grand subject, and this I should greatly regret. By </td></tr>
<tr><td>the way, F. Balfour, who has worked for two or three years </td></tr>
<tr><td>in the laboratory at Cambridge, declares to George that he </td></tr>
<tr><td>has never seen an experiment, except with animals rendered </td></tr>
<tr><td>insensible. No doubt the names of doctors will have great </td></tr>
<tr><td>weight with the House of Commons ; but very many prac- </td></tr>
<tr><td>titioners neither know nor care anything about the progress </td></tr>
<tr><td>of knowledge. I cannot at present see my way to sign any </td></tr>
<tr><td>petition, without hearing what physiologists thought would </td></tr>
<tr><td>be its effect, and then judging for myself. I certainly could </td></tr>

<tr><td>the right of experimenting on living animals. I use this latter </td></tr>
<tr><td>expression as more correct and comprehensive than that of </td></tr>

<tr><td>which you may think fit, but if published I should wish the </td></tr>
<tr><td>whole to appear. I have all my life been a strong advocate </td></tr>
<tr><td>for humanity to animals, and have done what I could in my </td></tr>
<tr><td>writings to enforce this duty. Several years ago, when the </td></tr>
<tr><td>agitation against physiologists commenced in England, it </td></tr>
<tr><td>was asserted that inhumanity was here practised, and useless </td></tr>
<tr><td>suffering caused to animals ; and I was led to think that it </td></tr>
<tr><td>might be advisable to have an Act of Parliament on the </td></tr>
<tr><td>subject. I then took an active part in trying to get a Bill </td></tr>
<tr><td>passed, such as would have removed all just cause of com- </td></tr>
<tr><td>plaint, and at the same time have left physiologists free to </td></tr>
<tr><td>pursue their researches, ��� a Bill very different from the Act </td></tr>
<tr><td>which has since been passed. It is right to add that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>investigation of the matter by a Royal Commission proved </td></tr>
<tr><td>that the accusations made against our English physiologists </td></tr>
<tr><td>were false. From all that I have heard, however, I fear that </td></tr>
<tr><td>in some parts of Europe little regard is paid to the sufferings </td></tr>
<tr><td>of animals, and if this be the case, I should be glad to hear of </td></tr>
<tr><td>legislation against inhumanity in any such country. On the </td></tr>
<tr><td>other hand, I know that physiology cannot possibly progress </td></tr>
<tr><td>except by means of experiments on living animals, and I </td></tr>
<tr><td>feel the deepest conviction that he who retards the progress </td></tr>

<tr><td>from the report 'of the Commission. </td></tr>
<tr><td>(1.) The sentence ��� ��� It is not to be doubted that in- </td></tr>

<tr><td>became notorious some half century ago for his cruel </td></tr>
<tr><td>experiments on living animals. </td></tr>
<tr><td>(2.) The Commissioners, after speaking of the ���general </td></tr>

<tr><td>(p. 10):��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>���This principle is accepted generally by the very highly </td></tr>

<tr><td>differences of degree in regard to its practical application </td></tr>
<tr><td>will be easily discernible by those who study the evidence as </td></tr>
<tr><td>it has been laid before us.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>Again, according to the Commissioners (p. 10) : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� The secretary of the Royal Society for the Prevention of </td></tr>
<tr><td>Cruelty to Animals, when asked whether the general tendency </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the scientific world in this country is at variance with </td></tr>

<tr><td>My dear Sir, ��� I hope that you will forgive me for </td></tr>
<tr><td>troubling you with a very long letter. But first allow me to </td></tr>
<tr><td>tell you with what extreme pleasure and admiration I have </td></tr>
<tr><td>just finished reading your ���Great Ice Age.��� It seems to me </td></tr>
<tr><td>admirably done, and most clear. Interesting as many </td></tr>
<tr><td>chapters are in the history of the world, I do not think that </td></tr>
<tr><td>any one comes [up] nearly to the glacial period or periods. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Though I have steadily read much on the subject, your book </td></tr>
<tr><td>makes the whole appear almost new to me. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I am now going to mention a small observation, made by </td></tr>
<tr><td>me two or three years ago, near Southampton, but not fol- </td></tr>
<tr><td>lowed out, as I have no strength for excursions. I need say </td></tr>
<tr><td>nothing about the character of the drift there (which includes </td></tr>
<tr><td>palaeolithic celts), for you have described its essential features </td></tr>
<tr><td>in a few words at p. 506. It covers the whole country [in an] </td></tr>
<tr><td>even plain-like surface, almost irrespective of the present </td></tr>
<tr><td>outline of the land. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The coarse stratification has sometimes been disturbed. I </td></tr>
<tr><td>find that you allude ��� to the larger stones often standing on </td></tr>
<tr><td>end and this is the point which struck me so much. Not </td></tr>
<tr><td>only moderately sized angular stones, but small oval pebbles </td></tr>
<tr><td>often stand vertically up, in a manner which I have never seen </td></tr>
<tr><td>in ordinary gravel beds. This fact reminded me of what </td></tr>
<tr><td>occurs near my home, in the stiff red clay, full of unworn flints </td></tr>
<tr><td>over the chalk, which is no doubt the residue left undissolved </td></tr>
<tr><td>214 miscellanea ( continued . ). [1876. </td></tr>
<tr><td>by rain water. In this clay, flints as long and thin as my arm </td></tr>
<tr><td>often stand perpendicularly up ; and I have been told by the </td></tr>
<tr><td>tank-diggers that it is their ��� natural position ��� ! I presume </td></tr>
<tr><td>that this position may safely be attributed to the differential </td></tr>
<tr><td>movement of parts of the red clay as it subsided very slowly </td></tr>
<tr><td>from the dissolution of the underlying chalk ; so that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>flints arrange themselves in the lines of least resistance. The </td></tr>
<tr><td>similar but less strongly marked arrangement of the stones in </td></tr>
<tr><td>the drift near Southampton makes me suspect that it also </td></tr>
<tr><td>must have slowly subsided ; and the notion has crossed my </td></tr>
<tr><td>mind that during the commencement and height of the glacial </td></tr>
<tr><td>period great beds of frozen snow accumulated over the south </td></tr>
<tr><td>of England, and that, during the summer, gravel and stones </td></tr>
<tr><td>were washed from the higher land over its surface, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>in superficial channels. The larger streams may have cut </td></tr>
<tr><td>right through the frozen snow, and deposited gravel in lines </td></tr>
<tr><td>at the bottom. But on each succeeding autumn, when the </td></tr>
<tr><td>running water failed, I imagine that the lines of drainage </td></tr>
<tr><td>would have been filled up by blown snow afterwards con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>gealed, and that, owing to great surface accumulations of snow, </td></tr>
<tr><td>it would be a mere chance whether the drainage, together with </td></tr>
<tr><td>gravel and sand, would follow the same lines during the next </td></tr>
<tr><td>summer. Thus, as I apprehend, alternate layers of frozen </td></tr>
<tr><td>snow and drift, in sheets and lines, would ultimately have </td></tr>
<tr><td>covered the country to a great thickness, with lines of drift </td></tr>
<tr><td>probably deposited in various directions at the bottom by </td></tr>
<tr><td>the larger streams. As the climate became warmer, the </td></tr>
<tr><td>lower beds of frozen snow would have melted with extreme </td></tr>
<tr><td>slowness, and the many irregular beds of interstratified drift </td></tr>
<tr><td>would have sunk down with equal slowness ; and during this </td></tr>
<tr><td>movement the elongated pebbles would have arranged them- </td></tr>
<tr><td>selves more or less vertically. The drift would also have been </td></tr>
<tr><td>deposited almost irrespective of the outline of the under- </td></tr>
<tr><td>lying land. When I viewed the country I could not per- </td></tr>

<tr><td>[During the latter years of my father���s life there was a </td></tr>
<tr><td>growing tendency in the public to do him honour. In 1877 </td></tr>

<tr><td>of Cambridge. The degree was conferred on November 17, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and with the customary Latin speech from the Public Orator, </td></tr>
<tr><td>concluding with the words : ��� Tu vero, qui leges naturae tam </td></tr>
<tr><td>docte illustraveris, legum doctor nobis esto.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>The honorary degree led to a movement being set on foot </td></tr>
<tr><td>in the University to obtain some permanent memorial of my </td></tr>
<tr><td>father. A sum of about ��400 was subscribed, and after the </td></tr>
<tr><td>rejection of the idea that a bust would be the best memorial, </td></tr>
<tr><td>a picture was determined on. In June 1879 he sat to Mr. W. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Richmond for the portrait in the possession of the University, </td></tr>
<tr><td>now placed in the Library of the Philosophical Society at </td></tr>
<tr><td>Cambridge. He is represented seated in a Doctor���s gown, </td></tr>
<tr><td>the head turned towards the spectator : the picture has many </td></tr>
<tr><td>admirers, but, according to my own view, neither the attitude </td></tr>
<tr><td>nor the expression are characteristic of my father. </td></tr>
<tr><td>A similar wish on the part of the Linnean Society ��� with </td></tr>
<tr><td>which my father was so closely associated ��� led to his sitting </td></tr>
<tr><td>* This idea was a favourite one </td></tr>
<tr><td>with him, and he has described in </td></tr>

<tr><td>[The chief incident of a personal kind (not already dealt </td></tr>
<tr><td>with) in the years which we are now considering was the </td></tr>
<tr><td>death of his brother Erasmus, who died at his house in Queen </td></tr>
<tr><td>Anne Street, on August 26th, 1881. My father wrote to </td></tr>
<tr><td>Sir J. D. Hooker (Aug. 30) : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� The death of Erasmus is a very heavy loss to all of us, for </td></tr>
<tr><td>he had a most affectionate disposition. He always appeared </td></tr>
<tr><td>to me the most pleasant and clearest headed man, whom I </td></tr>
<tr><td>have ever known. London will seem a strange place to me </td></tr>
<tr><td>without his presence ; I am deeply glad that he died without </td></tr>
<tr><td>any great suffering, after a very short illness from mere </td></tr>
<tr><td>weakness and not from any definite disease.* </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� I cannot quite agree with you about the death of the old </td></tr>
<tr><td>and young. Death in the latter case, when there is a bright </td></tr>
<tr><td>future ahead, causes grief never to be wholly obliterated.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>An incident of a happy character may also be selected for </td></tr>
<tr><td>especial notice, since it was one which strongly moved my </td></tr>
<tr><td>father���s sympathy. A letter (Dec. 17, 1879) to Sir Joseph </td></tr>
<tr><td>Hooker shows that the possibility of a Government Pension </td></tr>
<tr><td>being conferred on Mr. Wallace first occurred to my father at </td></tr>
<tr><td>this time. The idea was taken up by others, and my father���s </td></tr>
<tr><td>letters show that he felt the most lively interest in the success </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the plan. He wrote, for instance, to Mrs. Fisher, ��� I hardly </td></tr>
<tr><td>ever wished for anything more than I do for the success </td></tr>
<tr><td>of our plan." He was deeply pleased when this thoroughly </td></tr>

<tr><td>There is much fascination in taking a bird���s eye view of all </td></tr>

<tr><td>regretted that you had not kept each science more separate ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>but I dare say you found it impossible. I have hardly any </td></tr>
<tr><td>criticisms, except that I think you ought to have introduced </td></tr>
<tr><td>Murchison as a great classifier of formations, second only to </td></tr>
<tr><td>W. Smith. You have done full justice, and not more than </td></tr>
<tr><td>justice, to our dear old master, Lyell. Perhaps a little more </td></tr>
<tr><td>ought to have been said about botany, and if you should ever </td></tr>
<tr><td>add this, you would find Sachs' 1 History,��� lately published, </td></tr>

<tr><td>pressing to you my unbounded admiration of your booty </td></tr>
<tr><td>tho��� I have read only to page 184 ��� my object having been </td></tr>
<tr><td>to do as little as possible while resting. I feel sure that you </td></tr>
<tr><td>have laid a broad and safe foundation for all future work on </td></tr>
<tr><td>Distribution. How interesting it will be to see hereafter </td></tr>
<tr><td>plants treated in strict relation to your views ; and then all </td></tr>
<tr><td>insects, pulmonate molluscs and fresh-water fishes, in greater </td></tr>
<tr><td>detail than I suppose you have given to these lower animals. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The point which has interested me most, but I do not say the </td></tr>
<tr><td>most valuable point, is your protest against sinking imaginary </td></tr>
<tr><td>continents in a quite reckless manner, as was stated by Forbes, </td></tr>
<tr><td>followed, alas, by Hooker, and caricatured by Wollaston and </td></tr>
<tr><td>[Andrew] Murray! By the way, the main impression that </td></tr>
<tr><td>the latter author has left on my mind is his utter want of all </td></tr>
<tr><td>scientific judgment I have lifted up my voice against the </td></tr>
<tr><td>above view with no avail, but I have no doubt that you will </td></tr>
<tr><td>succeed, owing to your new arguments and the coloured chart. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Of a special value, as it seems to me, is the conclusion that </td></tr>
<tr><td>we must determine the areas, chiefly by the nature of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>mammals. When I worked many years ago on this subject, </td></tr>
<tr><td>I doubted much whether the now called Palaearctic and </td></tr>
<tr><td>Nearctic regions ought to be separated ; and I determined if I </td></tr>
<tr><td>made another region that it should be Madagascar. I have, </td></tr>
<tr><td>therefore, been able to appreciate your evidence on these </td></tr>
<tr><td>points. What progress Palaeontology has made during the </td></tr>
<tr><td>last 20 years ; but if it advances at the same rate in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>future, our views on the migration and birth-place of the </td></tr>

<tr><td>to you on a few points ; but you must not waste your time </td></tr>
<tr><td>in answering at any length this scribble. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Firstly, your letter on intelligence was very useful to me </td></tr>
<tr><td>and I tore up and re-wrote what I sent to you. I have not </td></tr>
<tr><td>attempted to define intelligence ; but have quoted your </td></tr>
<tr><td>remarks on experience, and have shown how far they apply </td></tr>
<tr><td>to worms. It seems to me that they must be said to work </td></tr>

<tr><td>blind instinct. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Secondly, I was greatly interested by the abstract in </td></tr>
<tr><td>' Nature ��� of your work on Echinoderms,* the complexity with </td></tr>

<tr><td>Thirdly, Dr. Roux has sent me a book just published by </td></tr>
<tr><td>him: ��� Der Kampf der Theile,��� &c., 1881 (240 pages in </td></tr>
<tr><td>length). </td></tr>
<tr><td>He is manifestly a well-read physiologist and pathologist, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and from his position a good anatomist It is full of reason- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ing, and this in German is very difficult to me, so that I have </td></tr>
<tr><td>only skimmed through each page ; here and there reading </td></tr>
<tr><td>with a little more care. As far as I can imperfectly judge, it </td></tr>
<tr><td>is the most important book on Evolution which has appeared </td></tr>
<tr><td>for some time. I believe that G. H. Lewes hinted at the </td></tr>
<tr><td>same fundamental idea, viz. that there is a struggle going on </td></tr>
<tr><td>within every organism between the organic molecules, the </td></tr>
<tr><td>cells and the organs. I think that his basis is, that every cell </td></tr>
<tr><td>which best performs its function is, in consequence, at the same </td></tr>
<tr><td>time best nourished and best propagates its kind. The book </td></tr>
<tr><td>does not touch on mental phenomena, but there is much </td></tr>
<tr><td>discussion on rudimentary or atrophied parts, to which </td></tr>
<tr><td>subject you formerly attended. Now if you would like to </td></tr>
<tr><td>read this book, I would send it . . . If you read it, and are </td></tr>
<tr><td>struck with it (but I may be wholly mistaken about its value), </td></tr>
<tr><td>you would do a public service by analysing and criticising it </td></tr>
<tr><td>in ���Nature.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>Dr. Roux makes, I think, a gigantic oversight in never con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>sidering plants ; these would simplify the problem for him. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Fourthly, I do not know whether you will discuss in your </td></tr>
<tr><td>book on the mind of animals any of the more complex and </td></tr>
<tr><td>wonderful instincts. It is unsatisfactory work, as there can </td></tr>
<tr><td>be no fossilised instincts, and the sole guide is their state in </td></tr>
<tr><td>other members of the same order, and mere probability. </td></tr>
<tr><td>But if you do discuss any (and it will perhaps be expected </td></tr>
<tr><td>of you), I should think that you could not select a better case </td></tr>
<tr><td>than that of the sand wasps, which paralyse their prey, as </td></tr>
<tr><td>formerly described by Fabre, in his wonderful paper in the </td></tr>

<tr><td>1881.] </td></tr>
<tr><td>Whilst reading this latter book, I speculated a little on the </td></tr>
<tr><td>subject Astonishing nonsense is often spoken of the sand </td></tr>
<tr><td>wasp���s knowledge of anatomy. Now will any one say that </td></tr>
<tr><td>the Gauchos on the plains of La Plata have such knowledge, </td></tr>
<tr><td>yet I have often seen them pith a struggling and lassoed cow </td></tr>
<tr><td>on the ground with unerring skill, which no mere anatomist </td></tr>
<tr><td>could imitate. The pointed knife was infallibly driven in </td></tr>
<tr><td>between the vertebrae by a single slight thrust I presume </td></tr>
<tr><td>that the art was first discovered by chance, and that each </td></tr>
<tr><td>young Gaucho sees exactly how the others do it, and then </td></tr>
<tr><td>with a very little practice learns the art Now I suppose that </td></tr>
<tr><td>the sand wasps originally merely killed their prey by stinging </td></tr>
<tr><td>them in many places (see p. 129 of Fabre���s * Souvenirs,��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>and p. 241) on the lower and softest side of the body ��� and </td></tr>
<tr><td>that to sting a certain segment was found by far the most </td></tr>
<tr><td>successful method ; and was inherited like the tendency of a </td></tr>
<tr><td>bulldog to pin the nose of a bull, or of a ferret to bite the </td></tr>
<tr><td>cerebellum. It would not be a very great step in advance to </td></tr>
<tr><td>prick the ganglion of its prey only slightly, and thus to give </td></tr>
<tr><td>its larvae fresh meat instead of old dried meat Though </td></tr>
<tr><td>Fabre insists so strongly on the unvarying character of </td></tr>
<tr><td>instinct yet it is shown that there is some variability, as at </td></tr>

<tr><td>Any character of an ancient, generalised, or intermediate </td></tr>

<tr><td>countless generations, and this explains the extraordinarily </td></tr>
<tr><td>complicated affinities of existing groups. This idea seems </td></tr>

<tr><td>to represent affinities, which radiate in all directions, often to </td></tr>
<tr><td>very distant sub-groups, ��� a difficulty which has haunted me </td></tr>
<tr><td>for half a century. A strong case could be made out in favour </td></tr>

<tr><td>Your idea, to show what travellers have done, seems to me </td></tr>
<tr><td>a brilliant and just one, especially considering your audience. </td></tr>
<tr><td>1. I know nothing about Toumefort���s works. </td></tr>
<tr><td>2. I believe that you are fully right in calling Humboldt </td></tr>
<tr><td>the greatest scientific traveller who ever lived. I have lately </td></tr>
<tr><td>read two or three volumes again. His Geology is funny stuff ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>but that merely means that he was not in advance of his age. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I should say he was wonderful, more for his near approach to </td></tr>
<tr><td>omniscience than for originality. Whether or not his position </td></tr>
<tr><td>as a scientific man is as eminent as we think, you might truly </td></tr>
<tr><td>call him the parent of a grand progeny of scientific travellers, </td></tr>
<tr><td>who, taken together, have done much for science. </td></tr>
<tr><td>3. It seems to me quite just to give Lyell (and secondarily </td></tr>
<tr><td>E. Forbes) a very prominent place. </td></tr>
<tr><td>4 Dana was, I believe, the first man who maintained the </td></tr>
<tr><td>permanence of continents and the great oceans. . . . When I </td></tr>
<tr><td>read the 'Challenger���s' conclusion that sediment from the </td></tr>
<tr><td>land is not deposited at greater distances than 200 to 300 </td></tr>
<tr><td>miles from the land, I was much strengthened in my old </td></tr>
<tr><td>belief. Wallace seems to me to have argued the case ex- </td></tr>
<tr><td>cellently. Nevertheless, I would speak, if I were in your place, </td></tr>
<tr><td>rather cautiously ; for T. Mellard Reade has argued lately </td></tr>
<tr><td>with some force against the view ; but I cannot call to mind his </td></tr>
<tr><td>arguments. If forced to express a judgment, I should abide </td></tr>
<tr><td>by the view of approximate permanence since Cambrian days. </td></tr>
<tr><td>5. The extreme importance of the Arctic fossil plants, is </td></tr>
<tr><td>self-evident Take the opportunity of groaning over [our] </td></tr>
<tr><td>ignorance of the Lignite Plants of Kerguelen Land, or any </td></tr>
<tr><td>Antarctic land. It might do good. </td></tr>
<tr><td>6. I cannot avoid feeling sceptical about the travelling of </td></tr>
<tr><td>plants from the North except during the Tertiary period. It </td></tr>
<tr><td>may of course have been so and probably was so from one </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the two poles at the earliest period, during Pre-Cambrian </td></tr>
<tr><td>ages; but such speculations seem to me hardly scientific, </td></tr>
<tr><td>seeing how little we know of the old Floras. </td></tr>
<tr><td>248 miscellanea ��� ( continued ). [1881. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I will now jot down without any order a few miscellaneous </td></tr>
<tr><td>remarks. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I think you ought to allude to Alph. De Candolle���s great </td></tr>
<tr><td>book, for though it (like almost everything else) is washed out </td></tr>
<tr><td>of my mind, yet I remember most distinctly thinking it a </td></tr>
<tr><td>very valuable work. Anyhow, you might allude to his </td></tr>
<tr><td>excellent account of the history of all cultivated plants. </td></tr>
<tr><td>How shall you manage to allude to your New Zealand and </td></tr>
<tr><td>Tierra del Fuego work ? if you do not allude to them you </td></tr>
<tr><td>will be scandalously unjust. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The many Angiosperm plants in the Cretacean beds of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>United States (and as far as I can judge the age of these </td></tr>
<tr><td>beds has been fairly well made out) seems to me a fact of </td></tr>
<tr><td>very great importance, so is their relation to the existing flora </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the United States under an Evolutionary point of view. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Have not some Australian extinct forms been lately found in </td></tr>
<tr><td>Australia ? or have I dreamed it ? </td></tr>
<tr><td>Again, the recent discovery of plants rather low down in </td></tr>
<tr><td>our Silurian beds is very important. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Nothing is more extraordinary in the history of the Vege- </td></tr>
<tr><td>table Kingdom, as it seems to me, than the apparently very </td></tr>
<tr><td>sudden or abrupt development of the higher plants. I have </td></tr>
<tr><td>sometimes speculated whether there did not exist somewhere </td></tr>
<tr><td>during long ages an extremely isolated continent, perhaps </td></tr>
<tr><td>near the South Pole. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Hence I was greatly interested by a view which Saporta </td></tr>
<tr><td>propounded to me, a few years ago, at great length in MS. </td></tr>
<tr><td>and which I fancy he has since published, as I urged him to </td></tr>
<tr><td>do ��� viz., that as soon as flower-frequenting insects were </td></tr>
<tr><td>developed, during the latter part of the secondary period, an </td></tr>
<tr><td>enormous impulse was given to the development of the higher </td></tr>
<tr><td>plants by cross-fertilization being thus suddenly formed. </td></tr>
<tr><td>A few years ago I was much struck with Axel Blytt���s* </td></tr>
<tr><td>Essay showing from observation, on the peat beds in Scandi- </td></tr>

<tr><td>rain and other with less rain (perhaps connected with Croll���s </td></tr>
<tr><td>recurrent astronomical periods), and that these periods had </td></tr>
<tr><td>largely determined the present distribution of the plants of </td></tr>
<tr><td>Norway and Sweden. This seemed to me a very important </td></tr>
<tr><td>I have just read over my remarks and I fear that they will </td></tr>
<tr><td>not be of the slightest use to you. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I cannot but think that you have got through the hardest, </td></tr>
<tr><td>or at least the most difficult, part of your work in having made </td></tr>
<tr><td>so good and striking a sketch of what you intend to say ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>but I can quite understand how you must groan over the </td></tr>
<tr><td>great necessary labour. </td></tr>

<tr><td>Society, in hopes that it will be published in their Journal. </td></tr>
<tr><td>This journal goes to every scientific institution in the world, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and the contents are abstracted in all year-books on Zoology. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Therefore I have preferred it to ���Nature,��� though the latter has </td></tr>
<tr><td>a wider circulation, but is ephemeral. </td></tr>
<tr><td>1 have prefaced your essay by a few general remarks, to </td></tr>
<tr><td>which I hope that you will not object. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Of course I do not know that the Zoological Society, which </td></tr>
<tr><td>is much addicted to mere systematic work, will publish your </td></tr>
<tr><td>essay. If it does, I will send you copies of your essay, but </td></tr>
<tr><td>these will not be ready for some months. If not published </td></tr>
<tr><td>by the Zoological Society, I will endeavour to get ��� Nature��� to </td></tr>
<tr><td>publish it. I am very anxious that it should be published </td></tr>
<tr><td>and preserved. Dear Sir, </td></tr>
<tr><td>Yours faithfully, </td></tr>
<tr><td>C. Darwin. </td></tr>

<tr><td>FERTILISATION OF FLOWERS. </td></tr>
<tr><td>[In the letters already given we have had occasion to notice </td></tr>
<tr><td>the general bearing of a number of botanical problems on the </td></tr>
<tr><td>wider question of Evolution. The detailed work in botany </td></tr>
<tr><td>which my father accomplished by the guidance of the light </td></tr>
<tr><td>cast on the study of natural history by his own work on </td></tr>
<tr><td>Evolution remains to be noticed. In a letter to Mr. Murray, </td></tr>
<tr><td>September 74th, 1861, speaking of his book on the ���Ferti- </td></tr>
<tr><td>lisation of Orchids,��� he says : ��� It will perhaps serve to </td></tr>
<tr><td>illustrate how Natural History may be worked under the </td></tr>
<tr><td>belief of the modification of species.��� This remark gives a </td></tr>
<tr><td>suggestion as to the value and interest of his botanical work, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and it might be expressed in far more emphatic language </td></tr>
<tr><td>without danger of exaggeration. </td></tr>
<tr><td>In the same letter to Mr. Murray, he says : ��� I think this </td></tr>
<tr><td>little volume will do good to the ' Origin,��� as it will show that </td></tr>
<tr><td>I have worked hard at details.��� It is true that his botanical </td></tr>
<tr><td>work added a mass of corroborative detail to the case for </td></tr>
<tr><td>Evolution, but the chief support to his doctrines given by </td></tr>
<tr><td>these researches was of another kind. They supplied an </td></tr>
<tr><td>argument against those critics who have so freely dogmatised </td></tr>
<tr><td>as to the uselessness of particular structures, and as to the </td></tr>
<tr><td>consequent impossibility of their having been developed by </td></tr>
<tr><td>means of natural selection. His observations on Orchids </td></tr>
<tr><td>enabled him to say : ��� I can show the meaning of some of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the apparently meaningless ridges, horns ; who will now </td></tr>
<tr><td>FERTILISATION OF FLOWERS. </td></tr>
<tr><td>255 </td></tr>
<tr><td>venture to say that this or that structure is useless?" A </td></tr>
<tr><td>kindred point is expressed in a letter to Sir J. D. Hooker </td></tr>
<tr><td>(May 14th, 1862) : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>���When many parts of structure, as in the woodpecker, </td></tr>
<tr><td>show distinct adaptation to external bodies, it is preposterous </td></tr>
<tr><td>to attribute them to the effects of climate, &a, but when a </td></tr>
<tr><td>single point alone, as a hooked seed, it is conceivable it may </td></tr>
<tr><td>thus have arisen. I have found the study of Orchids emi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>nently useful in showing me how nearly all parts of the flower </td></tr>
<tr><td>are co-adapted for fertilisation by insects, and therefore the </td></tr>
<tr><td>results of natural selection, ��� even the most trifling details of </td></tr>
<tr><td>structure.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>One of the greatest services rendered by my father to the </td></tr>
<tr><td>study of Natural History is the revival of Teleology. The </td></tr>
<tr><td>evolutionist studies the purpose or meaning of organs with </td></tr>
<tr><td>the zeal of the older Teleology, but with far wider and more </td></tr>
<tr><td>coherent purpose. He has the invigorating knowledge that </td></tr>
<tr><td>he is gaining not isolated conceptions of the economy of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>present, but a coherent view of both past and present And </td></tr>
<tr><td>even where he fails to discover the use of any part, he may, </td></tr>
<tr><td>by a knowledge of its structure, unravel the history of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>past vicissitudes in the life of the species. In this way a </td></tr>
<tr><td>vigour and unity is given to the study of the forms of </td></tr>
<tr><td>organised beings, which before it lacked. This point has </td></tr>
<tr><td>already been discussed in Mr. Huxley���s chapter on the </td></tr>
<tr><td>'Reception of the Origin of Species��� and need not be </td></tr>
<tr><td>here considered. It does, however, concern us to recognize </td></tr>
<tr><td>that this ���great service to natural science,��� as Dr. Gray </td></tr>
<tr><td>describes it, was effected almost as much by his special </td></tr>
<tr><td>botanical work as by the ��� Origin of Species.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>For a statement of the scope and influence of my father���s </td></tr>
<tr><td>botanical work, I may refer to Mr. Thiselton Dyer���s article </td></tr>
<tr><td>in 1 Charles Darwin,��� one of the Nature Series. Mr. Dyer���s </td></tr>
<tr><td>wide knowledge, his friendship with my father, and especially </td></tr>
<tr><td>his power of sympathising with the work of others, combine </td></tr>
<tr><td>256 </td></tr>
<tr><td>FERTILISATION </td></tr>
<tr><td>to give this essay a permanent value. The following passage </td></tr>
<tr><td>(p. 43) gives a true picture : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� Notwithstanding the extent and variety of his botanical </td></tr>
<tr><td>work, Mr. Darwin always disclaimed any right to be regarded </td></tr>
<tr><td>as a professed botanist. He turned his attention to plants, </td></tr>
<tr><td>doubtless because they were convenient objects for studying </td></tr>
<tr><td>organic phenomena in their least complicated forms ; and this </td></tr>
<tr><td>point of view, which, if one may use the expression without </td></tr>
<tr><td>disrespect, had something of the amateur about it, was in </td></tr>
<tr><td>itself of the greatest importance. For, from not being, till he </td></tr>
<tr><td>took up any point, familiar with the literature bearing on it, </td></tr>
<tr><td>his mind was absolutely free from any prepossession. He </td></tr>
<tr><td>was never afraid of his facts, or of framing any hypothesis, </td></tr>
<tr><td>however startling, which seemed to explain them. ... In any </td></tr>
<tr><td>one else such an attitude would have produced much work </td></tr>
<tr><td>that was crude and rash. But Mr. Darwin ��� if one may </td></tr>
<tr><td>venture on language which will strike no one who had con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>versed with him as over-strained ��� seemed by gentle persua- </td></tr>
<tr><td>sion to have penetrated that reserve of nature which baffles </td></tr>
<tr><td>smaller men. In other words, his long experience had given </td></tr>
<tr><td>him a kind of instinctive insight into the method of attack of </td></tr>
<tr><td>any biological problem, however unfamiliar to him, while he </td></tr>
<tr><td>rigidly controlled the fertility of his mind in hypothetical </td></tr>
<tr><td>explanations by the no less fertility of ingeniously devised </td></tr>
<tr><td>experiment��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>To form any just idea of the greatness of the revolution </td></tr>
<tr><td>worked by my father���s researches in the study of the fertilisa- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tion of flowers, it is necessary to know from what a condition </td></tr>
<tr><td>this branch of knowledge has emerged. It should be re- </td></tr>
<tr><td>membered that it was only during the early years of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>present century that the idea of sex, as applied to plants, </td></tr>
<tr><td>became firmly established. Sachs, in his ��� History of Botany��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>(1875), has given some striking illustrations of the remark- </td></tr>
<tr><td>able slowness with which its acceptance gained ground. He </td></tr>
<tr><td>remarks that when we consider the experimental proofs given </td></tr>
<tr><td>OF FLOWERS. </td></tr>
<tr><td>257 </td></tr>
<tr><td>by Camerarius (1694)1 and by Kolreuter (1761-66), it appears </td></tr>
<tr><td>incredible that doubts should afterwards have been raised as </td></tr>
<tr><td>to the sexuality of plants. Yet he shows that such doubts </td></tr>
<tr><td>did actually repeatedly crop up. These adverse criticisms </td></tr>
<tr><td>rested for the most part on careless experiments, but in many </td></tr>
<tr><td>cases on d priori arguments. Even as late as 1820, a book of </td></tr>
<tr><td>this kind, which would now rank with circle squaring, or flat- </td></tr>
<tr><td>earth philosophy, was seriously noticed in a botanical journal. </td></tr>
<tr><td>A distinct conception of sex as applied to plants had not </td></tr>
<tr><td>long emerged from the mists of profitless discussion and </td></tr>
<tr><td>feeble experiment, at the time when my father began botany </td></tr>
<tr><td>by attending Henslow���s lectures at Cambridge. </td></tr>
<tr><td>When the belief in the sexuality of plants had become </td></tr>
<tr><td>established as an incontrovertible piece of knowledge, a </td></tr>
<tr><td>weight of misconception remained, weighing down any </td></tr>
<tr><td>rational view of the subject Camerarius * believed (naturally </td></tr>
<tr><td>enough in his day) that hermaphrodite flowers are necessarily </td></tr>
<tr><td>self-fertilised. He had the wit to be astonished at this, a </td></tr>
<tr><td>degree of intelligence which, as Sachs points out, the majority </td></tr>
<tr><td>of his successors did not attain to. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The following extracts from a note-book show that this, </td></tr>
<tr><td>point occurred to my father as early as 1837 : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>"Do not plants which have male and female organs </td></tr>
<tr><td>together [i.e. in the same flower] yet receive influence from- </td></tr>
<tr><td>other plants ? Does not Lyell give some argument about </td></tr>
<tr><td>varieties being difficult to keep [true] on account of pollen </td></tr>
<tr><td>from other plants ? Because this may be applied to show all </td></tr>
<tr><td>plants do receive intermixture.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>Sprengel,f indeed, understood that the hermaphrodite </td></tr>
<tr><td>structure of flowers by no means necessarily leads to self- </td></tr>
<tr><td>fertilisation. But although he discovered that in many cases </td></tr>
<tr><td>pollen is of necessity carried to the stigma of another flower ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>he did not understand that in the advantage gained by the </td></tr>

<tr><td>intercrossing of distinct plants lies the key to the whole </td></tr>
<tr><td>question. Hermann Muller has well remarked that this </td></tr>
<tr><td>���omission was for several generations fatal to Sprengel���s </td></tr>
<tr><td>work For both at the time and subsequently, botanists </td></tr>
<tr><td>felt above all the weakness of his theory, and they set aside, </td></tr>
<tr><td>along with his defective ideas, his rich store of patient and </td></tr>
<tr><td>acute observations and his comprehensive and accurate inter- </td></tr>
<tr><td>pretations.��� It remained for my father to convince the world </td></tr>
<tr><td>that the meaning hidden in the structure of flowers was to </td></tr>
<tr><td>be found by seeking light in the same direction in which </td></tr>
<tr><td>Sprengel, seventy years before, had laboured. Robert Brown </td></tr>
<tr><td>was the connecting link between them ; for although, accord- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ing to Dr. Gray, * Brown, in common with the rest of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>world, looked on Sprengel���s ideas as fantastic, yet it was at </td></tr>
<tr><td>his recommendation that my father in 1841 read Sprengel���s </td></tr>
<tr><td>now celebrated ���Secret of Nature Displayed.! The book </td></tr>
<tr><td>impressed him as being ��� full of truth,��� although ��� with some </td></tr>
<tr><td>little nonsense.��� It not only encouraged him in kindred </td></tr>
<tr><td>speculation, but guided him in his work, for in 1844 he </td></tr>
<tr><td>speaks of verifying Sprengel���s observations. It may be </td></tr>
<tr><td>doubted whether Robert Brown ever planted a more fruitful </td></tr>
<tr><td>seed than in putting such a book into such hands. </td></tr>
<tr><td>A passage in the ���Autobiography��� (vol. i. p. 90) shows </td></tr>
<tr><td>how it was that my father was attracted to the subject of </td></tr>
<tr><td>fertilisation: ���During the summer of 1839, and I believe </td></tr>
<tr><td>during the previous summer, I was led to attend to the </td></tr>
<tr><td>cross-fertilisation of flowers by the aid of insects, from </td></tr>
<tr><td>having come to the conclusion in my speculations on the </td></tr>
<tr><td>origin of species, that crossing played an important part in </td></tr>
<tr><td>keeping specific forms constant.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>The original connection between the study of flowers and </td></tr>
<tr><td>the problem of Evolution is curious, and could hardly have </td></tr>
<tr><td>been predicted. Moreover, it was not a permanent bond. </td></tr>

<tr><td>Gray seems to have been written before the publication of </td></tr>

<tr><td>animals being hermaphrodite without the concourse of two </td></tr>
<tr><td>individuals.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>A letter to Dr. Asa Gray (Sept 5th, 1857) gives the sub- </td></tr>
<tr><td>stance of the paper in the Gar denerd Chronicle : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� Lately I was led to examine buds of kidney bean with </td></tr>
<tr><td>the pollen shed ; but I was led to believe that the pollen could </td></tr>
<tr><td>hardly get on the stigma by wind or otherwise, except by </td></tr>
<tr><td>bees visiting [the flower] and moving the wing petals : hence </td></tr>
<tr><td>I included a small bunch of flowers in two bottles in every </td></tr>
<tr><td>way treated the same : the flowers in one I daily just </td></tr>
<tr><td>momentarily moved, as if by a bee ; these set three line </td></tr>
<tr><td>pods, the other not one. Of course this little experiment </td></tr>
<tr><td>must be tried again, and this year in England it is too late, </td></tr>
<tr><td>as the flowers seem now seldom to set. If bees are neces- </td></tr>
<tr><td>sary to this flower���s self-fertilisation, bees must almost cross </td></tr>
<tr><td>them, as their dusted right-side of head and right legs </td></tr>

<tr><td>this because there are such beautiful contrivances to prevent </td></tr>
<tr><td>the stigma ever getting its own pollen ; which seems only </td></tr>
<tr><td>explicable on the doctrine of the advantage of crosses.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>The paper was supplemented by a second in 1858.* The </td></tr>
<tr><td>chief object of these publications seems to have been to </td></tr>
<tr><td>obtain information as to the possibility of growing varieties </td></tr>
<tr><td>of leguminous plants near each other, and yet keeping </td></tr>
<tr><td>them true. It is curious that the Papilionaceae should not </td></tr>
<tr><td>only have been the first flowers which attracted his attention </td></tr>
<tr><td>by their obvious adaptation to the visits of insects, but should </td></tr>
<tr><td>also have constituted one of his sorest puzzles. The common </td></tr>
<tr><td>pea and the sweet pea gave him much difficulty, because, </td></tr>
<tr><td>although they are as obviously fitted for insect-visits as the </td></tr>
<tr><td>rest of the order, yet their varieties keep true. The fact is </td></tr>
<tr><td>that neither of these plants being indigenous, they are not </td></tr>
<tr><td>perfectly adapted for fertilisation by British insects. He </td></tr>
<tr><td>could not, at this stage of his observations, know that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>co-ordination between a flower and the particular insect </td></tr>
<tr><td>which fertilises it may be as delicate as that between a lock </td></tr>
<tr><td>and its key, so that this explanation was not likely to occur </td></tr>
<tr><td>to him.f </td></tr>
<tr><td>Besides observing the Leguminosae, he had already begun, </td></tr>
<tr><td>as shown in the foregoing extracts, to attend to the structure </td></tr>
<tr><td>of other flowers in relation to insects. At the beginning of </td></tr>
<tr><td>i860 he worked at Leschenaultia,t which at first puzzled him, </td></tr>
<tr><td>* Gardeners' Chronicle , 1858, </td></tr>
<tr><td>p. 828. In 1861 another paper on </td></tr>
<tr><td>Fertilisation appeared in the Gar- </td></tr>
<tr><td>deners��� Chronicle, p. 552, in which </td></tr>
<tr><td>he explained the action of insects </td></tr>
<tr><td>on Vinca major. He was attracted </td></tr>
<tr><td>to the periwinkle by the fact that it </td></tr>
<tr><td>is not visited by insects and never </td></tr>
<tr><td>in the habits of insects. He pub- </td></tr>

<tr><td>but was ultimately made out. A passage in a letter chiefly </td></tr>
<tr><td>relating to Leschenaultia seems to show that it was only in </td></tr>
<tr><td>the spring of i860 that he began widely to apply his know- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ledge to the relation of insects to other flowers. This is </td></tr>
<tr><td>somewhat surprising, when we remember that he had read </td></tr>
<tr><td>Sprengel many years before. He wrote (May 14) : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>���I should look at this curious contrivance as specially </td></tr>
<tr><td>related to visits of insects ; as I begin to think is almost </td></tr>
<tr><td>universally the case.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>Even in July 1862 he wrote to Dr. Asa Gray : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>���There is no end to the adaptations. Ought not these </td></tr>
<tr><td>cases to make one very cautious when one doubts about the </td></tr>
<tr><td>use of all parts? I fully believe that the structure of all </td></tr>
<tr><td>irregular flowers is governed in relation to insects. Insects </td></tr>
<tr><td>are the Lords of the floral (to quote the witty Athenaum) </td></tr>
<tr><td>world.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>He was probably attracted to the study of Orchids by </td></tr>
<tr><td>the fact that several kinds are common near Down. The </td></tr>
<tr><td>letters of i860 show that these plants occupied a good deal of </td></tr>
<tr><td>his attention ; and in 1861 he gave part of the summer, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>all the autumn to the subject. He evidently considered </td></tr>
<tr><td>himself idle for wasting time on Orchids which ought to </td></tr>
<tr><td>have been given to ' Variation under Domestication.��� Thus </td></tr>
<tr><td>he wrote : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� There is to me incomparably more interest in observing </td></tr>

<tr><td>these subjects, and not sticking to varieties of the con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>founded cocks, hens and ducks. I hear that Lyell is savage </td></tr>
<tr><td>at me. I shall never resist Linum next summer.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>It was in the summer of i860 that he made out one of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>most striking and familiar facts in the book, namely, the </td></tr>
<tr><td>manner in which the pollen masses in Orchis are adapted </td></tr>
<tr><td>for removal by insects. He wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker </td></tr>

<tr><td>which has great power of movement, and seizes hold of </td></tr>

<tr><td>another movement takes place in the pollen masses, by </td></tr>
<tr><td>which they are beautifully adapted to leave pollen on the </td></tr>
<tr><td>two lateral stigmatic surfaces. I never saw anything so </td></tr>
<tr><td>beautiful.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>In June of the same year he wrote : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>"You speak of adaptation being rarely visible, though </td></tr>
<tr><td>present in plants. I have just recently been looking at the </td></tr>
<tr><td>common Orchis, and I declare I think its adaptations in every </td></tr>

<tr><td>must have been, and, as I ought not in my book to give </td></tr>

<tr><td>He wrote also to Dr. Gray, June 8, i860 : ��� </td></tr>

<tr><td>This work was valuable from a systematic point of view. </td></tr>
<tr><td>In 1880 he wrote to Mr. Bentham : ��� </td></tr>

<tr><td>sation t of the Bee-orchis. You have already thrown some </td></tr>
<tr><td>light on the subject, and your present observations promise </td></tr>

<tr><td>I formed two conjectures : first, that some insect during </td></tr>
<tr><td>certain seasons might cross the plants, but I have almost </td></tr>
<tr><td>given up this ; nevertheless, pray have a look at the flowers </td></tr>
<tr><td>next season. Secondly, I conjectured that the Spider and </td></tr>
<tr><td>Bee-orchids might be a crossing and self-fertile form of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>same species. Accordingly I wrote some years ago to an </td></tr>
<tr><td>acquaintance, asking him to mark some Spider-orchids, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>observe whether they retained the same character ; but he </td></tr>
<tr><td>evidently thought the request as foolish as if I had asked him </td></tr>
<tr><td>to mark one of his cows with a ribbon, to see if it would turn </td></tr>
<tr><td>next spring into a horse. Now will you be so kind as to tie </td></tr>
<tr><td>a string round the stem of half-a-dozen Spider-orchids, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>when you leave Mentone dig them up, and I would try and </td></tr>
<tr><td>cultivate them and see if they kept constant ; but I should re- </td></tr>
<tr><td>quire to know in what sort of soil and situations they grow. It </td></tr>
<tr><td>would be indispensable to mark the plant so that there could be </td></tr>
<tr><td>no mistake about the individual. It is also just possible that </td></tr>

<tr><td>THE ���EFFECTS OF CROSS- AND SELF-FERTILISATION </td></tr>
<tr><td>IN THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM.��� 1 876. </td></tr>
<tr><td>[This book, as pointed out in the ���Autobiography,��� is a </td></tr>
<tr><td>complement to the ��� Fertilisation of Orchids,��� because it shows </td></tr>
<tr><td>how important are the results of cross-fertilisation which are </td></tr>
<tr><td>ensured by the mechanisms described in that book. By </td></tr>
<tr><td>proving that the offspring of cross-fertilisation are more </td></tr>
<tr><td>vigorous than the offspring of self-fertilisation, he showed that </td></tr>
<tr><td>one circumstance which influences the fate of young plants in </td></tr>
<tr><td>the struggle for life is the degree to which their parents are </td></tr>
<tr><td>fitted for cross-fertilisation. He thus convinced himself that </td></tr>
<tr><td>the intensity of the struggle (which he had elsewhere shown </td></tr>
<tr><td>to exist among young plants) is a measure of the strength </td></tr>
<tr><td>of a selective agency perpetually sifting out every modification </td></tr>
<tr><td>in the structure of flowers which can affect its capabilities </td></tr>
<tr><td>for cross-fertilisation. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The book is also valuable in another respect, because it </td></tr>
<tr><td>throws light on the difficult problems of the origin of sexuality. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The increased vigour resulting from cross-fertilisation is allied </td></tr>
<tr><td>in the closest manner to the advantage gained by change </td></tr>
<tr><td>of conditions. So strongly is this the case, that in some </td></tr>
<tr><td>instances cross-fertilisation gives no advantage to the off- </td></tr>
<tr><td>spring, unless the parents have lived under slightly different </td></tr>
<tr><td>conditions. So that the really important thing is not that two </td></tr>
<tr><td>individuals of different blood shall unite, but two individuals </td></tr>

<tr><td>vigour into the offspring by the coalescence of differentiated </td></tr>
<tr><td>elements, an advantage which could not follow if reproductions </td></tr>
<tr><td>were entirely asexual. </td></tr>
<tr><td>It is remarkable that this book, the result of eleven years </td></tr>
<tr><td>of experimental work, owed its origin to a chance observation. </td></tr>
<tr><td>My father had raised two beds of Linaria vulgaris��� one set </td></tr>
<tr><td>being the offspring of cross- and the other of self-fertilisation. </td></tr>
<tr><td>These plants were grown for the sake of some observations </td></tr>
<tr><td>on inheritance, and not with any view to cross-breeding, and he </td></tr>
<tr><td>was astonished to observe that the offspring of self-fertilisa- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tion were clearly less vigorous than the others. It seemed </td></tr>
<tr><td>incredible to him that this result could be due to a single act </td></tr>
<tr><td>of self-fertilisation, and it was only in the following year, </td></tr>
<tr><td>when precisely the same result occurred in the case of a </td></tr>
<tr><td>similar experiment on inheritance in Carnations, that his </td></tr>
<tr><td>attention was ��� thoroughly aroused,��� and that he determined </td></tr>

<tr><td>���DIFFERENT FORMS OF FLOWERS ON PLANTS OF THE </td></tr>
<tr><td>SAME SPECIES.��� 1 877. </td></tr>
<tr><td>[The volume bearing the above title was published in 1877, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and was dedicated by the author to Professor Asa Gray, ��� as </td></tr>
<tr><td>a small tribute of respect and affection.��� It consists of </td></tr>
<tr><td>certain earlier papers re-edited, with the addition of a </td></tr>
<tr><td>quantity of new matter. The subjects treated in the book </td></tr>
<tr><td>(i.) Heterostyled Plants. </td></tr>
<tr><td>(ii.) Polygamous, Dicecious, and Gynodicecious Plants. </td></tr>
<tr><td>(iii.) Cleistogamic Flowers. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The nature of heterostyled plants may be illustrated in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>primrose, one of the best known examples of the class. If a </td></tr>
<tr><td>number of primroses be gathered, it will be found that some </td></tr>
<tr><td>plants yield nothing but ��� pin-eyed ��� flowers, in which the </td></tr>
<tr><td>style (or organ for the transmission of the pollen to the ovule) </td></tr>
<tr><td>is long, while the others yield only ��� thrum-eyed ��� flowers with </td></tr>
<tr><td>short styles. Thus primroses are divided into two sets or </td></tr>
<tr><td>castes differing structurally from each other. My father </td></tr>
<tr><td>showed that they also differ sexually, and that in fact the bond </td></tr>
<tr><td>between the two castes more nearly resembles that between </td></tr>
<tr><td>separate sexes than any other known relationship. Thus for </td></tr>
<tr><td>example a long-styled primrose, though it can be fertilised by </td></tr>
<tr><td>its own pollen, is not fully fertile unless it is impregnated by </td></tr>
<tr><td>the pollen of a short-styled flower. Heterostyled plants are </td></tr>
<tr><td>comparable to hermaphrodite animals, such as snails, which </td></tr>
<tr><td>require the concourse of two individuals, although each pos- </td></tr>
<tr><td>2 96 ���DIFFERENT FORMS OF FLOWERS </td></tr>
<tr><td>sesses both the sexual elements. The difference is that in </td></tr>
<tr><td>the case of the primrose it is perfect fertility, and not simply </td></tr>
<tr><td>fertility, that depends on the mutual action of the two sets of </td></tr>
<tr><td>individuals. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The work on heterostyled plants has a special bearing, to </td></tr>
<tr><td>which the author attached much importance, on the problem </td></tr>
<tr><td>of origin of species.* </td></tr>
<tr><td>He found that a wonderfully close parallelism exists </td></tr>
<tr><td>between hybridisation and certain forms of fertilisation </td></tr>
<tr><td>among heterostyled plants. So that it is hardly an exag- </td></tr>
<tr><td>geration to say that the ��� illegitimately ��� reared seedlings are </td></tr>
<tr><td>hybrids, although both their parents belong to identically the </td></tr>
<tr><td>same species. In a letter to Professor Huxley, given in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>second volume (p. 384), my father writes as if his researches </td></tr>
<tr><td>on heterostyled plants tended to make him believe that </td></tr>
<tr><td>sterility is a selected or acquired quality. But in his later </td></tr>
<tr><td>publications, eg. in the sixth edition of the ���Origin,��� he </td></tr>
<tr><td>adheres to the belief that sterility is an incidental rather than </td></tr>
<tr><td>a selected quality. The result of his work on heterostyled </td></tr>
<tr><td>plants is of importance as showing that sterility is no test </td></tr>
<tr><td>of specific distinctness, and that it depends on differentiation </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the sexual elements which is independent of any racial </td></tr>
<tr><td>difference. I imagine that it was his instinctive love of </td></tr>
<tr><td>making out a difficulty which to a great extent kept him </td></tr>
<tr><td>at work so patiently on the heterostyled plants. But it </td></tr>
<tr><td>was the fact that general conclusions of the above character </td></tr>
<tr><td>could be drawn from his results which made him think his </td></tr>

<tr><td>My dear Gray, ��� The very day after my last letter, </td></tr>
<tr><td>yours of November 10th, and the review in ���Silliman,��� which </td></tr>
<tr><td>I feared might have been lost, reached me. We were all very </td></tr>
<tr><td>much interested by the political part of your letter ; and in </td></tr>
<tr><td>some odd way one never feels that information and opinions </td></tr>

<tr><td>dead, whereas all that you write is full of life. The reviews </td></tr>
<tr><td>interested me profoundly; you rashly ask for my opinion, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and you must consequently endure a long letter. First for </td></tr>
<tr><td>Dimorphism ; I do not at present like the term ��� Dicecio- </td></tr>
<tr><td>dimorphism ;������ for I think it gives quite a false notion, that </td></tr>
<tr><td>the phenomena are connected with a separation of the sexes. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Certainly in Primula there is unequal fertility in the two </td></tr>
<tr><td>forms, and I suspect this is the case with Linum; and, </td></tr>
<tr><td>therefore, I felt bound in the Primula paper to state that it </td></tr>
<tr><td>might be a step towards a dioecious condition; though I </td></tr>
<tr><td>believe there are no dioecious forms in Primulaceae or Linacem. </td></tr>
<tr><td>But the three forms in Lythrum convince me that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>phenomenon is in no way necessarily connected with any </td></tr>
<tr><td>tendency to separation of sexes. The case seems to me in </td></tr>
<tr><td>result or function to be almost identical with what old </td></tr>
<tr><td>C. K. Sprengel called ���dichogamy,��� and which is so frequent </td></tr>
<tr><td>in truly hermaphrodite groups ; namely, the pollen and stigma </td></tr>
<tr><td>304 </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� DIFFERENT FORMS OF FLOWERS [1862. </td></tr>
<tr><td>of each flower being mature at different periods. If I am right, </td></tr>
<tr><td>it is very advisable not to use the term ��� dioecious,��� as this </td></tr>
<tr><td>at once brings notions of separation of sexes. </td></tr>
<tr><td>... I was much perplexed by Oliver���s remarks in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� Natural History Review ��� on the Primula case, on the lower </td></tr>
<tr><td>plants having sexes more often of the separated than in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>higher plants, ��� so exactly the reverse of what takes place </td></tr>
<tr><td>in animals. Hooker in his review of the ���Orchids��� repeats </td></tr>
<tr><td>this remark. There seems to be much truth in what you </td></tr>
<tr><td>say,* and it did not occur to me, about no improbability of </td></tr>
<tr><td>specialisation in certain lines in lowly organised beings. I </td></tr>
<tr><td>could hardly doubt that the hermaphrodite state is the </td></tr>
<tr><td>aboriginal one. But how is it in the conjugation of Con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>fervae ��� is not one of the two individuals here in fact male, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and the other female? I have been much puzzled by this </td></tr>
<tr><td>contrast in sexual arrangements between plants and animals. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Can there be anything in the following consideration : By </td></tr>
<tr><td>roughest calculation about one-third of the British genera of </td></tr>
<tr><td>aquatic plants belong to the Linnean classes of Mono and </td></tr>
<tr><td>Dicecia ; whilst of terrestrial plants (the aquatic genera being </td></tr>
<tr><td>subtracted) only one-thirteenth of the genera belong to these </td></tr>
<tr><td>two classes. Is there any truth in this fact generally ? Can </td></tr>
<tr><td>aquatic plants, being confined to a small area or small com- </td></tr>
<tr><td>munity of individuals, require more free crossing, and there- </td></tr>
<tr><td>fore have separate sexes ? But to return to one point, does </td></tr>
<tr><td>not Alph. de Candolle say that aquatic plants taken as a </td></tr>
<tr><td>whole are lowly organised, compared with terrestrial ; and </td></tr>
<tr><td>may not Oliver���s remark on the separation of the sexes in </td></tr>

<tr><td>portion does not move in the least, though not tied. The move- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ment goes on all day and all early night. It has no relation to </td></tr>

<tr><td>phenomenon for what I know, but it confounded me quite, </td></tr>
<tr><td>when I began to observe the irritability of the tendrils. I do </td></tr>

<tr><td>every one and a half or two hours sweeps a circle (according </td></tr>

<tr><td>in some way affect the leaf ; though this is almost impossible, </td></tr>
<tr><td>as I scrutinised with equal care those that I put into distilled </td></tr>
<tr><td>water (the same water being used for dissolving the carbonate </td></tr>
<tr><td>of ammonia). I then cut off four leaves (not touching them </td></tr>
<tr><td>with my fingers), and put them in plain water, and four other </td></tr>
<tr><td>leaves into the weak solution, and after leaving them for an </td></tr>
<tr><td>hour and a half, I examined every hair on all eight leaves ; </td></tr>

<tr><td>no change on the four in water ; every gland and hair affected </td></tr>
<tr><td>in those in ammonia. </td></tr>
<tr><td>���I had measured the quantity of weak solution, and I </td></tr>
<tr><td>counted the glands which had absorbed the ammonia, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>were plainly affected ; the result convinced me that each </td></tr>
<tr><td>gland could not have absorbed more than or i n inu ��f </td></tr>
<tr><td>a grain. I have tried numbers of other experiments all </td></tr>
<tr><td>pointing to the same result. Some experiments lead me to </td></tr>
<tr><td>believe that very sensitive leaves are acted on by much </td></tr>
<tr><td>smaller doses. Reflect how little ammonia a plant can get </td></tr>
<tr><td>growing on poor soil ��� yet it is nourished. The really sur- </td></tr>
<tr><td>prising part seems to me that the effect should be visible, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and not under very high power ; for after trying a high power, </td></tr>
<tr><td>I thought it would be safer not to consider any effect which </td></tr>
<tr><td>was not plainly visible under a two-thirds object glass and </td></tr>
<tr><td>middle eye-piece. The effect which the carbonate of ammonia </td></tr>
<tr><td>produces is the segregation of the homogeneous fluid in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>cells into a cloud of granules and colourless fluid ; and </td></tr>
<tr><td>subsequently the granules coalesce into larger masses, and for </td></tr>
<tr><td>hours have the oddest movements ��� coalescing, dividing, </td></tr>

<tr><td>mission is instantaneous ; analogy from animals would point </td></tr>
<tr><td>to transmission through nervous matter. Reflecting on </td></tr>
<tr><td>the rapid power of absorption in the glands, the extreme </td></tr>
<tr><td>sensibility of the whole organ, and the conspicuous move- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ment caused by varied stimulants, I have tried a number of </td></tr>
<tr><td>substances which are not caustic or corrosive, </td></tr>
<tr><td>but most of which are known to have a remarkable action </td></tr>
<tr><td>on the nervous matter of animals. You will see the results </td></tr>
<tr><td>in the enclosed paper. As the nervous matter of different </td></tr>
<tr><td>animals are differently acted on by the same poisons, one </td></tr>
<tr><td>would not expect the same action on plants and animals ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>only, if plants have diffused nervous matter, some degree of </td></tr>
<tr><td>analogous action. And this is partially the case. Consider- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ing these experiments, together with the previously made </td></tr>
<tr><td>remarks on the functions of the parts, I cannot avoid the </td></tr>

<tr><td>little about my recent work with Drosera, to show that I </td></tr>
<tr><td>have profited by your suggestions, and to ask a question or </td></tr>
<tr><td>1. It is really beautiful how quickly and well Drosera and </td></tr>
<tr><td>Dionaea dissolve little cubes of albumen and gelatine. I kept </td></tr>
<tr><td>the same sized cubes on wet moss for comparison. When </td></tr>
<tr><td>you were here I forgot that I had tried gelatine, but albumen </td></tr>
<tr><td>is far better for watching its dissolution and absorption. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Frankland has told me how to test in a rough way for </td></tr>
<tr><td>pepsine ; and in the autumn he will discover what acid the </td></tr>
<tr><td>digestive juice contains. </td></tr>
<tr><td>2. A decoction of cabbage-leaves and green peas causes </td></tr>
<tr><td>as much inflection as an infusion of raw meat ; a decoction of </td></tr>
<tr><td>grass is less powerful. Though I hear that the chemists try </td></tr>
<tr><td>to precipitate all albumen from the extract of belladonna, I </td></tr>
<tr><td>think they must fail, as the extract causes inflection, whereas </td></tr>
<tr><td>a new lot of atropine, as well as the valerianate [of atropine], </td></tr>
<tr><td>produce no effect. </td></tr>
<tr><td>3. I have been trying a good many experiments with </td></tr>
<tr><td>heated water. . . . Should you not call the following case one </td></tr>
<tr><td>of heat rigor ? Two leaves were heated to 130�� and had every </td></tr>
<tr><td>tentacle closely inflected ; one was taken out and placed in </td></tr>
<tr><td>cold water, and it re-expanded ; the other was heated to 145 0 , </td></tr>
<tr><td>and had not the least power of re-expansion. Is not this </td></tr>

<tr><td>[as to] the sensitiveness of Drosera. I made a solution of </td></tr>
<tr><td>one part of phosphate of ammonia by weight to 218,750 </td></tr>
<tr><td>of water; of this solution I gave so much that a leaf </td></tr>
<tr><td>got -gtfoQ of a grain of the phosphate. I then counted the </td></tr>
<tr><td>glands, and each could have got only n i z h smt a g ra ' n i </td></tr>
<tr><td>this being absorbed by the glands, sufficed to cause the </td></tr>
<tr><td>tentacles bearing these glands to bend through an angle of </td></tr>
<tr><td>180��. Such sensitiveness requires hot weather, and carefully </td></tr>
<tr><td>selected young yet mature leaves. It strikes me as a </td></tr>
<tr><td>wonderful fact I must add that I took every precaution, by </td></tr>
<tr><td>trying numerous leaves at the same time in the solution and </td></tr>
<tr><td>in the same water which was used for making the solution. </td></tr>

<tr><td>leaves that I never thought of removing the moss, and this </td></tr>
<tr><td>was very stupid of me. The great solid bladder-like swellings </td></tr>
<tr><td>almost on the surface are wonderful objects, but are not the </td></tr>

<tr><td>food from the decaying mass. For Utricularia is a carrion- </td></tr>
<tr><td>feeder, and not strictly carnivorous like Drosera. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The great solid bladder-like bodies, I believe, are reservoirs </td></tr>

<tr><td>[The few sentences in the autobiographical chapter give with </td></tr>
<tr><td>sufficient clearness the connection between the ���Power of </td></tr>
<tr><td>Movement,��� and one of the author's earlier books, that on </td></tr>
<tr><td>' Climbing Plants.��� The central idea of the book is that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>movements of plants in relation to light, gravitation, &c., </td></tr>
<tr><td>are modifications of a spontaneous tendency to revolve or </td></tr>
<tr><td>circumnutate, which is widely inherent in the growing parts </td></tr>
<tr><td>of plants. This conception has not been generally adopted, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and has not taken a place among the canons of orthodox </td></tr>
<tr><td>physiology. The book has been treated by Professor Sachs </td></tr>
<tr><td>with a few words of professorial contempt ; and by Professor </td></tr>
<tr><td>Wiesner it has been honoured by careful and generously </td></tr>
<tr><td>expressed criticism. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Mr. Thiselton Dyer * has well said : ��� Whether this masterly </td></tr>
<tr><td>conception of the unity of what has hitherto seemed a chaos of </td></tr>
<tr><td>unrelated phenomena will be sustained, time alone will show. </td></tr>
<tr><td>But no one can doubt the importance of what Mr. Darwin </td></tr>
<tr><td>has done, in showing that for the future the phenomena of </td></tr>
<tr><td>plant movement can and indeed must be studied from a </td></tr>
<tr><td>single point of view.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>The work was begun in the summer of 1877, after the </td></tr>
<tr><td>publication of * Different Forms of Flowers,��� and by the </td></tr>
<tr><td>autumn his enthusiasm for the subject was thoroughly estab- </td></tr>
<tr><td>lished, and he wrote to Mr. Dyer : ���I am all on fire at the </td></tr>

<tr><td>discover what useful purpose these sleep-movements could </td></tr>
<tr><td>serve, and wrote to Sir Joseph Hooker (March 25th, 1878):��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� I think we have proved that the sleep of plants is to lessen </td></tr>
<tr><td>the injury to the leaves from radiation. This has interested </td></tr>
<tr><td>me much, and has cost us great labour, as it has been a </td></tr>

<tr><td>given of the effects of cutting off the tips of horizontally </td></tr>
<tr><td>extended roots, and of those laterally exposed to moisture ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>but I cannot persuade myself that the horizontal position of </td></tr>
<tr><td>lateral branches and roots is due simply to their lessened </td></tr>

<tr><td>on the subject Now for the last ten years I have been </td></tr>
<tr><td>experimenting in crossing and self-fertilising plants ; and one </td></tr>
<tr><td>indirect result has surprised me much ; namely, that by taking </td></tr>
<tr><td>pains to cultivate plants in pots under glass during several </td></tr>
<tr><td>successive generations, under nearly similar conditions, and by </td></tr>
<tr><td>self-fertilising them in each generation, the colour of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>flowers often changes, and, what is very remarkable, they </td></tr>
<tr><td>became in some of the most variable species, such as Mimulus, </td></tr>
<tr><td>Carnation, &c., quite constant, like those of a wild species. </td></tr>
<tr><td>This fact and several others have led me to the suspicion </td></tr>
<tr><td>that the cause of variation must be in different substances </td></tr>
<tr><td>absorbed from the soil by these plants when their powers of </td></tr>
<tr><td>absorption are not interfered with by other plants with which </td></tr>
<tr><td>they grow mingled in a state of nature. Therefore my son </td></tr>
<tr><td>and I wish to grow plants in pots in soil entirely, or as nearly </td></tr>
<tr><td>entirely as is possible, destitute of all matter which plants </td></tr>
<tr><td>absorb, and then to give during several successive generations </td></tr>
<tr><td>to several plants of the same species as different solutions as </td></tr>
<tr><td>may be compatible with their life and health. And now, can </td></tr>
<tr><td>you advise me how to make soil approximately free of all the </td></tr>

<tr><td>silver sand, sold for cleaning harness, &c., is nearly pure silica, </td></tr>

<tr><td>imagine that it would be impossible to keep the soil damp </td></tr>
<tr><td>and fit for the growth of plants. I presume that clay washed </td></tr>
<tr><td>over and over again in water would still yield mineral matter </td></tr>
<tr><td>to the carbonic acid secreted by the roots. I should want a </td></tr>
<tr><td>good deal of soil, for it would be useless to experimentise </td></tr>
<tr><td>unless we could fill from twenty to thirty moderately sized </td></tr>
<tr><td>flower-pots every year. Can you suggest any plan ? for unless </td></tr>
<tr><td>you can it would, I fear, be useless for us to commence an </td></tr>
<tr><td>attempt to discover whether variability depends at all on </td></tr>

<tr><td>several generations. Plants, moreover, were selected which </td></tr>
<tr><td>were the most likely to vary under such conditions, judging </td></tr>
<tr><td>from the existence of closely-allied forms adapted for these </td></tr>
<tr><td>conditions. No doubt I originally attributed too little weight </td></tr>

<tr><td>I was not so old, and had more strength, for I see lines </td></tr>
<tr><td>of research to follow. Hoffmann even doubts whether </td></tr>
<tr><td>plants vary more under cultivation than in their native home </td></tr>

<tr><td>C. Darwin to T. H. Farrer. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Down, March 2, 1878. </td></tr>
<tr><td>My DEAR Farrer, ��� Mr. Torbitt���s plan of overcoming the </td></tr>
<tr><td>potato-disease seems to me by far the best which has ever </td></tr>
<tr><td>been suggested. It consists, as you know from his printed </td></tr>
<tr><td>letter, of rearing a vast number of seedlings from cross-fertil- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ised parents, exposing them to infection, ruthlessly destroying </td></tr>
<tr><td>all that suffer, saving those which resist best, and repeating </td></tr>
<tr><td>the process in successive seminal generations. My belief in </td></tr>
<tr><td>the probability of good results from this process rests on the </td></tr>
<tr><td>fact of all characters whatever occasionally varying. It is </td></tr>
<tr><td>known, for instance, that certain species and varieties of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>vine resist phylloxera better than others. Andrew Knight </td></tr>
<tr><td>found one variety or species of the apple which was not in </td></tr>
<tr><td>the least attacked by coccus, and another variety has been </td></tr>
<tr><td>observed in South Australia. Certain varieties of the peach </td></tr>
<tr><td>resist mildew, and several other such cases could be given. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Therefore there is no great improbability in a new variety of </td></tr>
<tr><td>potato arising which would resist the fungus completely, or </td></tr>
<tr><td>at least much better than any existing variety. With respect </td></tr>
<tr><td>to the cross-fertilisation of two distinct seedling plants, it has </td></tr>
<tr><td>been ascertained that the offspring thus raised inherit much </td></tr>
<tr><td>i8 7 8.] </td></tr>
<tr><td>BOTANICAL LETTERS. </td></tr>
<tr><td>349 </td></tr>
<tr><td>more vigorous constitutions and generally are more prolific </td></tr>
<tr><td>than seedlings from self-fertilised parents. It is also probable </td></tr>
<tr><td>that cross-fertilisation would be especially valuable in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>case of the potato, as there is reason to believe that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>flowers are seldom crossed by our native insects ; and some </td></tr>
<tr><td>varieties are absolutely sterile unless fertilised with pollen </td></tr>
<tr><td>from a distinct variety. There is some evidence that the good </td></tr>
<tr><td>effects from a cross are transmitted for several generations ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>it would not, therefore be necessary to cross-fertilise the </td></tr>
<tr><td>seedlings in each generation, though this would be desirable, </td></tr>
<tr><td>as it is almost certain that a greater number of seeds would </td></tr>
<tr><td>thus be obtained. It should be remembered that a cross </td></tr>
<tr><td>between plants raised from the tubers of the same plant, </td></tr>
<tr><td>though growing on distinct roots, does no more good than a </td></tr>
<tr><td>cross between flowers on the same individual. Considering </td></tr>
<tr><td>the whole subject, it appears to me that it would be a national </td></tr>
<tr><td>misfortune if the cross-fertilised seeds in Mr. Torbitt���s posses- </td></tr>
<tr><td>sion produced by parents which have already shown some </td></tr>
<tr><td>power of resisting the disease, are not utilised by the Govern- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ment, or some public body, and the process of selection </td></tr>
<tr><td>continued during several more generations. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Should the Agricultural Society undertake the work, Mr. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Torbitt���s knowledge gained by experience would be especially </td></tr>
<tr><td>valuable ; and an outline of the plan is given in his printed </td></tr>
<tr><td>letter. It would be necessary that all the tubers produced by </td></tr>
<tr><td>each plant should be collected separately, and carefully </td></tr>
<tr><td>examined in each succeeding generation. </td></tr>
<tr><td>It would be advisable that some kind of potato eminently </td></tr>
<tr><td>liable to the disease should be planted in considerable numbers </td></tr>
<tr><td>near the seedlings so as to infect them. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Altogether the trial would be one requiring much care and </td></tr>
<tr><td>extreme patience, as I know from experience with analogous </td></tr>

<tr><td>"Shortly before his death, Mr. Charles Darwin informed </td></tr>
<tr><td>Sir Joseph Hooker that it was his intention to devote </td></tr>

<tr><td>aid or furtherance of some work or works of practical </td></tr>
<tr><td>utility to biological science, and to make provisions in his </td></tr>
<tr><td>will in the event of these not being completed during his </td></tr>

<tr><td>��� Amongst other objects connected with botanical science, </td></tr>
<tr><td>Mr. Darwin regarded with especial interest the importance of </td></tr>
<tr><td>a complete index to the names and authors of the genera and </td></tr>
<tr><td>species of plants known to botanists, together with their </td></tr>
<tr><td>native countries. Steudel���s * Nomenclator ��� is the only existing </td></tr>

<tr><td>old, Mr. Darwin had found it of great aid in his own re- </td></tr>
<tr><td>searches. It has been indispensable to every botanical insti- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tution, whether as a list of all known flowering plants, as an </td></tr>
<tr><td>indication of their authors, or as a digest of botanical </td></tr>

<tr><td>My father, like other botanists, had as Sir Joseph Hooker </td></tr>
<tr><td>points out, experienced the value of Steudel���s work. He </td></tr>
<tr><td>obtained plants from all sorts of sources, which were often </td></tr>
<tr><td>incorrectly named, and he felt the necessity of adhering to </td></tr>
<tr><td>the accepted nomenclature, so that he might convey to other </td></tr>
<tr><td>workers precise indications as to the plants which he had </td></tr>
<tr><td>studied. It was also frequently a matter of importance to </td></tr>
<tr><td>him to know the native country of his experimental plants. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Thus it was natural that he should recognize the desirability of </td></tr>
<tr><td>completing and publishing the interleaved volume at Kew. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The wish to help in this object was heightened by the admira- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tion he felt for the results for which the world has to thank </td></tr>
<tr><td>the Royal Gardens at Kew, and by his gratitude for the in- </td></tr>
<tr><td>valuable aid which for so many years he received from its </td></tr>

<tr><td>CHAPTER XIII. </td></tr>
<tr><td>CONCLUSION. </td></tr>
<tr><td>SOME idea of the general course of my father���s health may </td></tr>
<tr><td>have been gathered from the letters given in the preceding </td></tr>
<tr><td>pages. The subject of health appears more prominently </td></tr>
<tr><td>than is often necessary in a Biography, because it was, </td></tr>
<tr><td>unfortunately, so real an element in determining the outward </td></tr>
<tr><td>form of his life. </td></tr>
<tr><td>During the last ten years of his life the state of his health </td></tr>
<tr><td>was a cause of satisfaction and hope to his family. His con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>dition showed signs of amendment in several particulars. </td></tr>
<tr><td>He suffered less distress and discomfort, and was able to </td></tr>
<tr><td>work more steadily. Something has been already said of </td></tr>
<tr><td>Dr. Bence Jones���s treatment, from which my father certainly </td></tr>
<tr><td>derived benefit. In later years he became a patient of </td></tr>
<tr><td>Sir Andrew Clark, under whose care he improved greatly </td></tr>
<tr><td>in general health. It was not only for his generously ren- </td></tr>
<tr><td>dered service that my father felt a debt of gratitude towards </td></tr>
<tr><td>Sir Andrew Clark. He owed to his cheering personal </td></tr>
<tr><td>influence an often-repeated encouragement, which latterly </td></tr>
<tr><td>added something real to his happiness, and he found sincere </td></tr>
<tr><td>pleasure in Sir Andrew���s friendship and kindness towards </td></tr>
<tr><td>himself and his children. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Scattered through the past pages are one or two references </td></tr>
<tr><td>to pain or uneasiness felt in the region of the heart. How </td></tr>
<tr><td>far these indicate that the heart was affected early in life, </td></tr>
<tr><td>I cannot pretend to say ; in any case it is certain that he </td></tr>
<tr><td>had no serious or permanent trouble of this nature until </td></tr>
<tr><td>2 A 2 </td></tr>
<tr><td>356 CONCLUSION. [l88l. </td></tr>
<tr><td>shortly before his death. In spite of the general improve- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ment in his health, which has been above alluded to, there </td></tr>
<tr><td>was a certain loss of physical vigour occasionally apparent </td></tr>
<tr><td>during the last few years of his life. This is illustrated by </td></tr>
<tr><td>a sentence in a letter to his old friend Sir James Sulivan, </td></tr>
<tr><td>written on January 10, 1879: ���My scientific work tires me </td></tr>
<tr><td>more than it used to do, but I have nothing else to do, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>whether one is worn out a year or two sooner or later signi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>fies but little.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>A similar feeling is shown in a letter to Sir J. D. Hooker </td></tr>
<tr><td>of June 15, 1881. My father was staying at Patterdale, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>wrote : ���I am rather despondent about myself .... I have </td></tr>
<tr><td>not the heart or strength to begin any investigation lasting </td></tr>
<tr><td>years, which is the only thing which I enjoy, and I have no </td></tr>
<tr><td>little jobs which I can do.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>In July, 1881, he wrote to Mr. Wallace, ���We have just </td></tr>
<tr><td>returned home after spending five weeks on Ullswater ; the </td></tr>
<tr><td>scenery is quite charming, but I cannot walk, and everything </td></tr>
<tr><td>tires me, even seeing scenery .... What I shall do with my </td></tr>
<tr><td>few remaining years of life I can hardly tell. I have every- </td></tr>
<tr><td>thing to make me happy and contented, but life has become </td></tr>
<tr><td>very wearisome to me.��� He was, however, able to do a good </td></tr>
<tr><td>deal of work, and that of a trying sort,* during the autumn </td></tr>
<tr><td>of 1881, but towards the end of the year he was clearly in </td></tr>
<tr><td>need of rest ; and during the winter was in a lower condition </td></tr>
<tr><td>than was usual with him. </td></tr>
<tr><td>On December 13, he went for a week to his daughter's </td></tr>
<tr><td>house in Bryanston Street. During his stay in London he </td></tr>
<tr><td>went to call on Mr. Romanes, and was seized when on the </td></tr>
<tr><td>door-step with an attack apparently of the same kind as those </td></tr>
<tr><td>which afterwards became so frequent. The rest of the in- </td></tr>
<tr><td>cident, which I give in Mr. Romanes��� words, is interesting too </td></tr>
<tr><td>from a different point of view, as giving one more illustration </td></tr>
<tr><td>of my father���s scrupulous consideration for others : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>* On the action of carbonate of ammonia on roots and leaves. </td></tr>

<tr><td>1882.] </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� I happened to be out, but my butler, observing that Mr. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Darwin was ill, asked him to come in. He said he would </td></tr>
<tr><td>prefer going home, and although the butler urged him to </td></tr>
<tr><td>wait at least until a cab could be fetched, he said he would </td></tr>
<tr><td>rather not give so much trouble. For the same reason he </td></tr>
<tr><td>refused to allow the butler to accompany him. Accordingly </td></tr>
<tr><td>he watched him walking with difficulty towards the direction </td></tr>
<tr><td>in which cabs were to be met with, and saw that, when he </td></tr>
<tr><td>had got about three hundred yards from the house, he stag- </td></tr>
<tr><td>gered and caught hold of the park-railings as if to prevent </td></tr>
<tr><td>himself from falling. The butler therefore hastened to his </td></tr>
<tr><td>assistance, but after a few seconds saw him turn round with </td></tr>
<tr><td>the evident purpose of retracing his steps to my house. How- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ever, after he had returned part of the way he seems to </td></tr>
<tr><td>have felt better, for he again changed his mind, and proceeded </td></tr>
<tr><td>to find a cab.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>During the last week of February and in the. beginning of </td></tr>
<tr><td>March, attacks of pain in the region of the heart, with irre- </td></tr>
<tr><td>gularity of the pulse, became frequent, coming on indeed </td></tr>
<tr><td>nearly every afternoon. A seizure of this sort occurred about </td></tr>
<tr><td>March 7, when he was walking alone at a short distance from </td></tr>
<tr><td>the house ; he got home with difficulty, and this was the </td></tr>
<tr><td>last time that he was able to reach his favourite ���Sand- </td></tr>
<tr><td>walk.��� Shortly after this, his illness became obviously more </td></tr>
<tr><td>serious and alarming, and he was seen by Sir Andrew Clark, </td></tr>
<tr><td>whose treatment was continued by Dr. Norman Moore, of St </td></tr>
<tr><td>Bartholomew���s Hospital, and Mr. Allfrey, of St. Mary Cray. </td></tr>
<tr><td>He suffered from distressing sensations of exhaustion and </td></tr>
<tr><td>faintness, and seemed to recognise with deep depression the </td></tr>
<tr><td>fact that his working days were over. He gradually recovered </td></tr>
<tr><td>from this condition, and became more cheerful and hopeful, as </td></tr>
<tr><td>is shown in the following letter to Mr. Huxley, who was </td></tr>
<tr><td>anxious that my father should have closer medical supervision </td></tr>
<tr><td>than the existing arrangements allowed : ��� </td></tr>

<tr><td>CONCLUSION. </td></tr>
<tr><td>[1882. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Down, March 27, 1882. </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� My DEAR Huxley, ��� Your most kind letter has been a real </td></tr>
<tr><td>cordial to me. I have felt better to-day than for three weeks, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and have felt as yet no pain. Your plan seems an excellent </td></tr>
<tr><td>one, and I will probably act upon it, unless I get very much </td></tr>
<tr><td>better. Dr. Clark���s kindness is unbounded to me, but he is </td></tr>
<tr><td>too busy to come here. Once again, accept my cordial </td></tr>
<tr><td>thanks, my dear old friend. I wish to God there were more </td></tr>
<tr><td>automata * in the world like you. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Ever yours, </td></tr>
<tr><td>C. Darwin. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The allusion to Sir Andrew Clark requires a word of ex- </td></tr>
<tr><td>planation. Sir Andrew Clark himself was ever ready to </td></tr>
<tr><td>devote himself to my father, who, however, could not endure </td></tr>
<tr><td>the thought of sending for him, knowing how severely his </td></tr>
<tr><td>great practice taxed his strength. </td></tr>
<tr><td>No especial change occurred during the beginning of April, </td></tr>
<tr><td>but on Saturday 15th he was seized with giddiness while </td></tr>
<tr><td>sitting at dinner in the evening, and fainted in an attempt to </td></tr>
<tr><td>reach his sofa. On the 17th he was again better, and in my </td></tr>
<tr><td>temporary absence recorded for me the progress of an ex- </td></tr>
<tr><td>periment in which I was engaged. During the night of April </td></tr>
<tr><td>1 8th, about a quarter to twelve, he had a severe attack and </td></tr>
<tr><td>passed into a faint, from which he was brought back to </td></tr>
<tr><td>consciousness with great difficulty. He seemed to recognise </td></tr>
<tr><td>the approach of death, and said, ��� I am not the least afraid </td></tr>
<tr><td>to die.��� All the next morning he suffered from terrible </td></tr>
<tr><td>nausea and faintness, and hardly rallied before the end </td></tr>
<tr><td>came. </td></tr>
<tr><td>He died at about four o���clock on Wednesday, April 19th, </td></tr>
