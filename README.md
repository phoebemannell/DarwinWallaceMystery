# DarwinWallaceMystery

Welcome to our mystery! In this repo you will find resources for both parts of the digital history mystery. It is not necessary for you to use the various documents in this repo, they are only there if you want to double check that you are on the right path or maybe you want to jump into the game at a certain spot but don't have the time to complete all of the steps. Enjoy the game and be sure to let us know what you think!
