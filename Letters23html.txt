THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES.
[In the first volume, p. 82, the growth of the  Origin of Species
has been briefly described in my fathers words. The letters
given in the present and following chapters will illustrate and
amplify the history thus sketched out.
It is clear that, in the early part of the voyage of the Beagle
he did not feel it inconsistent with his views to express him-
self in thoroughly orthodox language as to the genesis of new
species. Thus in 1834 he wrote* at Valparaiso: I have
already found beds of recent shells yet retaining their colour
at an elevation of 1300 feet, and beneath the level country is
strewn with them. It seems not a very improbable conjecture
that the want of animals may be owing to none having been
created since this country was raised from the sea.
This pcissage does not occur in the published Journal, the
last proof of which was finished in 1837 ; and this fact har-
monizes with the change we know to have been proceeding in
his views. But in the published Journal  we find passages
which show a point of view more in accordance with orthodox

theological natural history than with his later views. Thus,
in speaking of the birds Synallaxis and Scytalopus (ist edit
p. 3S3 ; 2nd edit p. 289), he says: When finding, as in
this case, any animal which seems to play so insignificant
a part in the great scheme of nature, one is apt to wonder
why a distinct species should have been created.
A comparison of the two editions of the Journal is in-
structive, as giving some idea of the development of his
views on evolution. It does not give us a true index of
the mass of conjecture which was taking shape in his mind,
but it shows us that he felt sure enough of the truth of his
belief to allow a stronger tinge of evolution to appear in
the second edition. He has mentioned in the Autobiography
(p. 83), that it was not until he read Malthus that he got a
clear view of the potency of natural selection. This was in
1838  a year after he finished the first edition (it was not
published until 1839), and seven years before the second edition
was written (1845). Thus the turning-point in the formation
of his theory took place between the writing of the two
editions.
I will first give a few passages which are practically the
same in the two editions, and which are, therefore, chiefly of
interest as illustrating his frame of mind in 1837.
The case of the two species of Molothrus (ist edit. p. 61 ;
2nd edit p. S 3 ) must have been one of the earliest instances
noticed by him of the existence of representative species
a phenomenon which we know (Autobiography, p. 83) struck
him deeply. The discussion on introduced animals (ist edit
p. 139; 2nd edit p. l2o) shows how much he was impressed
by the complicated interdependence of the inhabitants of a
An analogous point of view is given in the discussion
(1st edit p. 98 ; 2nd edit p. 85) of the mistaken belief that
large animals require, for their support, a luxuriant vegeta-
tion ; the incorrectness of this view is illustrated by the com-

parison of the fauna of South Africa and South America, and
the vegetation of the two continents. The interest of the
discussion is that it shows clearly our i priori ignorance of
the conditions of life suitable to any organism.
There is a passage which has been more than once quoted
as bearing on the origin of his views. It is where he dis��
cusses the striking difference between the species of mice on
the east and west of the Andes (ist edit p. 399) :  Unless we
suppose the same species to have been created in two
different countries, we ought not to expect any closer simi-
larity between the organic beings on the opposite sides of
the Andes than on shores separated by a broad strait of the
sea. In the 2nd edit p. 327, the passage is almost verbally
identical, and is practically the same.
There are other passages again which are more strongly
evolutionary in the 2nd edit, but otherwise are similar to the
corresponding passages in the 1st edition. Thus, in describing
the blind Tuco-tuco (ist edit. p. 60 ; 2nd edit. p. 52), in the
first edition he makes no allusion to what Lamarck might
have thought, nor is the instance used as an example of
modification, as in the edition of 1845.
A striking passage occurs in the 2nd edit (p. 173) on the
relationship between the extinct edentata and the living
sloths, ant-eaters, and armadillos.
 This wonderful relationship in the same continent between
the dead and the living, will, I do not doubt, hereafter throw
more light on the appearance of organic beings on our earth,
and their disappearance from it, than any other class of facts.
This sentence does not occur in the 1st edit, but he was
evidently profoundly struck by the disappearance of the
gigantic forerunners of the present animals. The difference
between the discussions in the two editions is most instructive.
In both, our ignorance of the conditions of life is insisted on,
but in the second edition, the discussion is made to lead up to
a strong statement of the intensity of the struggle for life.

Then follows a comparison behveen rarity  and extinction,
which introduces the idea that the preservation and dominance
of existing species depend on the degree in which they are
adapted to surrounding conditions. In the first edition, he is
merely  tempted to believe in such simple relations as varia-
tion of climate and food, or introduction of enemies, or the
increased number of other species, as the .cause of the succes-
sion of races. But finally (1st edit.) he ends the chapter by
comparing the extinction of a species to the exhaustion and
disappearance of varieties of fruit-trees, as though he thought
that a mysterious term of life was impressed on each species
at its creation.
The difference of treatment of the Galapagos problem is of
some interest In the earlier book, the American type of the
productions of the islands is noticed, as is the fact that the
different islands possess forms specially their own, but the
importance of the whole problem is not so strongly put
forward. Thus, in the first edition, he merely says :
"This similarity of type between distant islands and con-
tinents, while the species are distinct, has scarcely been
sufficiently noticed. The circumstance would be explained,
according to the views of some authors, by saying that the
creative power had acted according to the same law over a
wide area.  (ist edit. p. 474.)
This passage is not given in the second edition, and the
generalisations on geographical distribution are much wider
and fuller. Thus he asks :
" Why were their aboriginal inhabitants, associated ... in
different proportions both in kind and number from those
on the Continent, and therefore acting on each other in a
different manner  why were they created on American types
of organisation ?  (2nd edit. p. 393-)

NOTE-BOOK OF 1837.
The same difference of treatment is shown elsewhere in this
chapter. Thus the gradation in the form of beak presented
by the thirteen allied species of finch is described in the first
edition (p. 461) without comment. Whereas in the second
edition (p. 380) he concludes :
 One might really fancy that from an original paucity of
birds in this Archipelago, one species has been taken and
modified for different ends.
On the whole it seems to me remarkable that the difference
between the two editions is not greater ; it is another proof of
the authors caution and self-restraint in the treatment of his
theory. After reading the second edition of the  Journal, we
find with a strong sense of surprise how far developed were
his views in 1837. We are enabled to form an opinion on
this point from the note-books in which he wrote down
detached thoughts and queries. I shall quote from the first
note-book, completed between July 1837 and February
1 838 : and this is the more worth doing, as it gives us an
insight into the condition of his thoughts before the reading
of Malthus. The notes are written in his most hurried style,
so many words being omitted, that it is often difficult to
arrive at the meaning. With a few exceptions (indicated by
square brackets)* I have printed the extracts as written ; the
punctuation, however, has been altered, and a few obvious
slips corrected where it seemed necessary. The extracts arc
not printed in order, but are roughly classified.f

" Countries longest separated greatest differences  if sepa-

"Will this apply to whole ot^anic kingdom when our planet

The two following extracts show that he applied the theory
of evolution to the "whole organic kingdom from plants to

Speaking elsewhere of intermediate forms, he remarks :
 Opponents will say  show them me. I will answer yes, if
you will show me every step between bulldog and grey-
hound.
Here we see that the case of domestic animals was already
present in his mind as bearing on the production of natural
species. The disappearance of intermediate forms naturally
leads up to the subject of extinction, with which the next
extract begins.
 It is a wonderful fact, horse, elephant, and mastodon,
dying out about same time in such different quarters.

it over a tract from CTTXTHR Spain to South America?  (Never.)

Why does individual die. To perpetuate certain peculi-
arities (therefore adaptation), and obliterate accidental varieties,
and to accommodate itself to change (for, of course, change,
even in varieties, is accommodation). Now this argument
applies to species.
If individual cannot propagate he has no issue  so with

sooner or later. Prove animals like plants  trace gradation
between associated and non-associated animals  and the story
will be complete.
Here we have the view already alluded to of a term of life
impressed on a species.

unfavourable variation, and thus a hint is given of natural
selection :
 With respect to extinction, we can easily see that [a]
variety of [the] ostrich (Petise), may not be well adapted,
and thus perish out ; or, on the other hand, like Orpheus [a
Galapagos bird], being favourable, many might be produced.
This requires [the] principle that the permanent variations
produced by confined breeding and changing circumstances
arc continued and produce[d] according io the adaptation of
such circumstances, and therefore that death of species is a
consequence (contrary to what would appear from America)
of non-adaptation of circumstances.
The first part of the next extract has a similar bearing.
The end of the passage is of much interest, as showing that
he had at this early date visions of the far-reaching character
of his speculations :
 With belief of transmutation and geographical grouping,
we are led to endeavour to discover causes of change ; the
manner of adaptation (wish of parents ? ?), instinct and struc-
ture becomes full of speculation and lines of observation.

The following two extracts have a similar interest ; the

second is especially interesting, as it contains the germ of
the concluding sentence of the  Origin of Species  : *
 Before the attraction of gravity discovered it might have
been said it was as great a difficulty to account for the
movement of all [planets] by one law, as to account for each
separate one ; so to say that all mammalia were born from
one stock, and since distributed by such means as we can
recognise, may be thought to explain nothing.
Astronomers might formerly have said that God fore-
ordered each planet to move in its particular destiny. In the
same manner God orders each animal created with certain
forms in certain countries ; but how much more simple and

The last extract which I shall quote gives the germ of his
theory of the relation between alpine plants in various parts
of the world, in the publication of which he was forestalled
by E. Forbes (see Vol. I. p. 88). He says, in the 1837 note-
book, that alpine plants,  formerly descended lower, therefore
[they are] species of lower genera altered, or northern plants.
When we turn to the Sketch of his theory, written in 1844
(still therefore before the second edition of the Journal
was completed), we find an enormous advance made on the
note-book of 1837. The Sketch is in fact a surprisingly com-
plete presentation of the argument afterwards familiar to us
in the  Origin of Species. There is some obscurity as to the
date of the short Sketch which formed the basis of the 1844
Essay. We know from his own words (Vol. I. p. 184), that it
was in June 1842 that he first wrote out a short sketch of
his views.* This statement is given with so much circum-
stance that it is almost Impossible to suppose that it contains
an error of date. It agrees also with the followng extract
from his Diary.

of Species to form Varieties, * the essay of 1844 (extracts
from which form part of the paper) is said to have been
sketched in 1839, and copied in 1844. This statement is
obviously made on the authority of a note written in my
fathers hand across the Table of Contents of the 1844 Essay.
It is to the following effect : This was sketched in 1839, and
copied out in full, as here written and read by you in 1844.
I conclude that this note was added in 1858, when the MS.
was sent to Sir J. D. Hooker (see Letter of June 29, 1858,
Vol. II. p. 1 19). There is also some further evidence on this side
of the question. CTTXTHR Writing to Mr. Wallace (Jan. 25, 1859) my
father says :   Every one whom I have seen has thought
your paper very well written and interesting. It puts my
extracts (written in 1839, now just twenty years ago !), which
I must say in apology were never for an instant intended for
publication, into the shade. The statement that the earliest
sketch was written in 1839 has been frequently made in
biographical notices of my father, no doubt on the authority
of the  Linnean Journal, but it must, I think, be considered
as erroneous. The error may possibly have arisen in this
way. In writing on the Table of Contents of the 1844 MS.
that it was sketched in 1839, I think my father may have
intended to imply that the framework of the theory was clearly
thought out by him at that date. In the Autobiography
(p. 88) he speaks of the time,  about 1839, when the theory
was clearly conceived, meaning, no doubt, the end of 1838
and beginning of 1839, when the reading of Malthus had
given him the key to the idea of natural selection. But this
explanation does not apply to the letter to Mr. Wallace ; and
with regard to the passage t in the 'Linnean Journal it is
difficult to understand how it should have been allowed to

remain as it now stands, conveying, as it clearly does, the
impression that 1839 was the date of his earliest written sketch.
The sketch of 1844 is written in a clerks hand, in two
hundred and thirty-one pages folio, blank leaves being
alternated with the MS. with a view to amplification. The
text has been revised and corrected, criticisms being pencilled
by himself on the margin. It is divided into two parts : I.  On
the variation of Organic Beings under Domestication and in
their Natural State. II. On the Evidence favourable and
opposed to the view that Species are naturally formed races
descended from common Stocks. The first part contains the
main argument of the  Origin of Species. It is founded, as is
the argument of that work, on the study of domestic animals,
and both the Sketch and the  Origin  open with a chapter
on variation under domestication and on artificial selection.
This is followed, in both essays, by discussions on variation
under nature, on natural selection, and on the struggle for
life. Here, any close resemblance between the two essays
with regard to arrangement ceases. Chapter III. of the
Sketch, which concludes the first part, treats of the varia-
tions which occur in the instincts and habits of animals,
and thus corresponds to some extent with Chapter VII. of
the Origin (ist edit.). It thus forms a complement to
the chapters which deal with variation in structure. It seems
to have been placed thus early in the Essay to prevent the
hasty rejection of the whole theory by a reader to whom
the idea of natural selection acting on instincts might seem
impossible. This is the more probable, as the Chapter on
Instinct in the  Origin  is specially mentioned (Introduction,
p. 5) as one of the  most apparent and gravest difficulties on
the theory. Moreover the chapter in the Sketch ends with
a discussion, whether any particular corporeal structures
are so wonderful as to justify the rejection //-��>��(} facie
of our theory. Under this heading comes the discussion of
the eye, which in the  Origin  finds its place in Chapter VI.

under " Difficulties on Theory. The second part seems to
have been planned in accordance with his favourite point of
view with regard to his theory. This is briefly given in a
letter to Dr. Asa Gray, November nth, 1859: I cannot
possibly believe that a false theory would explain so many
classes of facts, as I think it certainly does explain. On these
grounds I drop my anchor, and believe that the difficulties
will slowly disappear. On this principle, having stated the
theory in the first part, he proceeds to show to what extent
various wide series of facts can be explained by its means.
Thus the second part of the Sketch corresponds roughly
to the nine concluding Chapters of the First Edition of the
Origin. But we must exclude Chapter VII. (Origin) on
Instinct, which forms a chapter in the first part of the Sketch,
and Chapter VIII. (Origin) on Hybridism, a subject treated
in the Sketch with Variation under Nature  in the first part.
The following list of the chapters of the second part of the
Sketch will illustrate their correspondence with the final
chapters of the  Origin.
Chapter I. On the kind of intermediateness necessary,
and the number of such intermediate forms.
This includes a geological discussion, and corresponds to
parts of Chapters VI. and IX. of the  Origin.
Chapter II.  The gradual appearance and disappearance
of organic beings. Corresponds to Chapter X. of the
Chapter III.  Geographical Distribution. Corresponds to
Chapters XI. and XII. of the  Origin.
Chapter IV.  Affinities and Classification of Organic
beings.

Chapter VI. Rudimentary Organs.
These three chapters correspond to Chapter XII. of the
Chapter VII. Recapitulation and Conclusion. The final

sentence of tlie Sketch, which we saw in its first rough
form in the Note Book of 1837, closely resembles the final
sentence of the  Origin, much of it being identical. The
 Origin  is not divided into two " Parts, but we see traces of
such a division having been present in the writers mind, in
this resemblance between the second part of the Sketch and
the final chapters of the  Origin. That he should speak * of
the chapters on transition, on instinct, on hybridism, and
on the geological record, as forming a group, may be due to
the division of his early MS. into two parts.
Mr. Huxley, who was good enough to read the Sketch at
my request, while remarking that the  main lines of argu-
ment and the illustrations employed are the same, points
out that in the 1844 Essay,  much more weight is attached to
the influence of external conditions in producing variation^
and to the inheritance of acquired habits than in the
 Origin.
It is extremely interesting to find in the Sketch the first
mention of principles familiar to us in the  Origin of Species.
Foremost among these may be mentioned the principle of
Sexual Selection, which is clearly enunciated. The important
form of selection known as  unconscious, is also given.
Here also occurs a statement of the law that peculiarities
tend to appear in the offspring at an age corresponding to
that at which they occurred in the parent
Professor Newton, who was so kind as to look through the
1844 Sketch, tells me that my fathers remarks on the migra-
tion of birds, incidentally given in more than one passage,
show that he had anticipated the views of some later writers.
With regard to the general style of the Sketch, it is not
to-be expected that it should have all the characteristics of
the Origin, and we do not, in fact, find that balance and
control, that concentration and grasp, which are so striking
in the work of 1859.
  Origin, Introduction, p. 5-
PRINCIPLE OF DIVERGENCE.
In the Autobiography (Vol. I. p. 84) my father has stated
what seemed to him the chief flaw of the 1844 Sketch; he
had overlooked one problem of great importance, the
problem of the divergence of character. This point is dis-
cussed in the  Origin of Species, but, as it may not be familiar
to all readers, I will give a short account of the difficulty and
its solution. The author begins by stating that varieties
differ from each other less than species, and then goes on :
 Nevertheless, according to my view, varieties are species in
process of formation How then does the lesser dif-
ference between varieties become augmented into the greater
difference between species. * He shows how an analogous
divergence takes place under domestication where an originally
uniform stock of horses has been split up into race-horses,
dray-horses, &c., and then goes on to explain how the same
principle applies to natural species. From the simple
circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from
any one species become in structure, constitution, and habits,
by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and
widely diversified places in the polity of nature, and so be
enabled to increase in numbers.
The principle is exemplified by the fact that if on one plot
of ground a single variety of wheat be sown, and on to
another a mixture of varieties, in the latter case the produce
is greater. More individuals have been able to exist because
they were not all of the same variety. An organism becomes
more perfect and more fitted to survive when by division
of labour the different functions of life are performed by
different organs. In the same way a species becomes more
efficient and more able to survive when different sections of
the species become differentiated so as to fiil different stations.
In reading the Sketch of 1844, I have found it difficult to
recognise, as a flaw in the Essay, the absence of any definite
statement of the principle of divergence. Descent with

modification implies divergence, and we become so habituated
to a belief in descent, and therefore in divergence, that we
do not notice the absence of proof that divergence is in itself
an advantage. As shown in the Autobiography, my father
in 1876 found it hardly credible that he should have over-
looked the problem and its solution.
The following letter will be more in place here than its
chronological position, since it shows what was my fathers
feeling as to the value of the Sketch at the time of its
completion.]

in deciphering any of the scraps which the editor may think
possibly of use. I leave to the editors judgment whether to
interpolate these facts in the text, or as notes, or under
appendices. As the looking over the references and scraps
will be a long labour, and as the correcting and enlarging and
altering my sketch will also take considerable time, 1 leave
this sum ofj��'400 as some remuneration, and any profits from
the work. I consider that for this the editor is bound to get
the sketch published either at a publisher's or his own risk.
Many of the scraps in the portfolios contain mere rude sugges-
tions and early views, now useless, and many of the facts will
probably turn out as having no bearing on my theory.
With respect to editors, Mr. Lyell would be the best if he
would undertake it ; I believe he would find the work pleasant,
and he would learn some facts new to him. As the editor must
be a geologist as well as a naturalist, the next best editor would
be Professor Forbes of London. The next best (and quite
best in many respects) would be Professor Henslow. Dr.
Hooker would be very good. The next, Mr. Strickland.* If
none of these would undertake it, I would request you to
consult with Mr. Lyell, or some other capable man for some
editor, a geologist and naturalist Should one other hundred
pounds make the difference of procuring a good editor, I
request earnestly that you will raise 500.

CHAPTER II.
THE GROWTH OF THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES.
LETTERS, 1843-1856.
[The history of my fathers life is told more completely in
his correspondence with Sir J. D. Hooker than in any other
series of letters ; and this is especially true of the history
of the growth of the Origin of Species. This, therefore,
seems an appropriate place for the following notes, which
Sir Joseph Hooker has kindly given me. They give, more-
over, an interesting picture of his early friendship with my
father :
My first meeting with Mr. Darwin was in 1839, in
Trafalgar Square. I was walking with an officer who
had been his shipmate for a short time in the Beagle seven
years before, but who had not, I believe, since met him.
I was introduced ; the interview was of course brief, and the
memory of him that I carried away and still retain was that
of a rather tall and rather broad-shouldered man, with
a slight stoop, an agreeable and animated expression when
talking, beetle brows, and a hollow but mellow voice ; and
tliat his greeting of his old acquaintance was sailor-like
that is, delightfully frank and cordial. I observed him well,
for I was already aware of his attainments and labours, derived
from having read various proof-sheets of his then unpublished
 CTTXTHR Journal. These had been submitted to Mr. (afterwards Sir.
Charles) Lyell by Mr. Danvin, and by him sent to his father,
Ch. Lyell, Esq., of Kinnordy, who (being a very old friend of
my father, and taking a kind interest in my projected career
as a naturalist) had allowed me to peruse them. At this time
GROWTH OF THE ORIGIN.
[1843.
I was hurrying on my studies, so as to take my degree before
volunteering to accompany Sir James Ross in the Antarctic
Expedition, which had just been determined on by the
Admiralty ; and so pressed for time was I, that I used to
sleep with the sheets of the Journal under my pillow, that
1 might read them behveen waking and rising. They im-
pressed me profoundly, I might say despairingly, with the
variety of acquirements, mental and physical, required in
a naturalist who should follow in Darwins footsteps, whilst
they stimulated me to enthusiasm in the desire to travel
and observe.
" It has been a permanent source of happiness to me that
I knew so much of Mr. Danvins scientific work so many
years before that intimacy began which ripened into feelings
as near to those of reverence for his life, works, and cha-
racter cis is reasonable and proper. It only remains to add
to this little episode that I received a copy of the Journal
complete,  a gift from Mr. Lyell,  a few days before leaving
England.
 Very soon after the return of the Antarctic Expedition
my correspondence with Mr. Darwin began (December, 1843)
by his sending me a long letter, warmly congratulating
me on my return to my family and friends, and expressing
a wish to hear more of the results of the expedition, of which
he had derived some knowledge from private letters of my
own (written to or communicated through Mr. Lyell). Then,
plunging at once into scientific matters, he directed my atten-
tion to the importance of correlating the Fuegian Flora with
that of the Cordillera and of Europe, and invited me to study
the botanical collections which he had made in the Galapagos
Islands, as well as his Patagonian and Fuegian plants.
 This led to me sending him an outline of the conclusions
I had formed regarding the distribution of plants in the
southern regions, and the necessity of assuming the destruc-
tion of considerable areas of land to account fot 'the relations

of the flora of the so-called Antarctic Islands. I do not
suppose that any of these ideas were new to him, but they
led to an animated and lengthy correspondence full of
instruction."
CTTXTHR Here follows the letter (1843) to Sir J. D. Hooker above
referred to.]
My dear Sir,  I had hoped before this time to have had
the pleasure of seeing you and congratulating you on your
safe return from your long and glorious voyage. But as I
seldom go to London, we may not yet meet for some time
.without you are led to attend the Geological meetings.
I am anxious to know what you intend doing with all your
materials  I had so much pleas^re in reading parts of some
of your letters, that I shall be very sorry if I, as one of the
public, have no opportunity of reading a good deal more.
I suppose you are very busy now and full of enjoyment;
how well I remember the happiness of my first few months
of England  it was worth all the discomforts of many a gale 1
But I have run from the subject, which made me write, of
expressing my pleasure that Henslow (as he informed me
a few days since by letter) has sent to you my small collec-
tion of plants. You cannot think how much pleased I am,
as I feared they would have been all lost, and few as they arc,
they cost me a good deal of trouble. There are a very few
notes, which I believe Henslow has got, describing the
habitats, &c., of some few of the more remarkable plants.
I paid particular attention to the Alpine flowers of Tierra del
Fuego, and I am sure I got every plant which was in flower
in Patagonia at the seasons when we were there. I have long
thought that some general sketch of the Flora of the point of
land, stretching so far into the southern seas, would be very
curious. Do make comparative remarks on the species allied
to the European species, for the advantage of botanical
ignoramuses like myself. It has often struck me as a curious

point to find out, whether there are many European genera
in T. del Fuego which are not found along the ridge of the
Cordillera; the separation in such case would be so enor-
mous. Do point out in any sketch you draw up, what
genera are American and what European, and how great
the differences of the species are, when the genera are
European, for the sake of the ignoramuses.
I hope Henslow will send you my Galapagos plants (about
which Humboldt even expressed to me considerable curiosity)
 I took much pains in collecting all I could. A Flora of this
archipelago would, I suspect, offer a nearly parallel case to
that of St. Helena, which has so long excited interest.
Pray excuse this long rambling note, and believe me, my
dear sir, yours verj- sincerely,
C. Darwin.
Will you be so good as to present my respectful com-
pliments to Sir W. Hooker.
[CTTXTHR Referring to Sir J. D. Hookers work on the Galapagos
Flora, my father wrote in 1846:
 I cannot tell you how delighted and astonished I am at
the results of your examination ; how wonderfully they
support my assertion on the differences in the animals of the
different islands, about which I have always been fearful.
Again he wrote (1849) ;
 I received a few weeks ago your Galapagos papers,* and
I have read them since being here. I really cannot express
too strongly my admiration of the geographical discussion :
to my judgment it is a perfect model of what such a paper
should be ; it took me four days to read and think over.

flora as you have done the Galapagos. In the Systematic
paper I was rather disappointed in not finding general
remarks on affinities, structures, &c., such as you often give
in conversation, and such as De Candolle and St Hilaire
introduced in almost all their papers, and which make them
interesting even to a non-Botanist.
 Very soon aftenvards [continues Sir J. D. Hooker] in a
letter dated January 1844, the subject of the Origin of
Species  was brought fonvard by him, and I believe that I

. . . Besides a general interest about the southern lands, I
have been now ever since my return engaged in a very pre-
sumptuous work, and I know no one individual who would
not say a very foolish one. I was so struck with the distri-
bution of the Galapagos organisms, &c. &c., and with the
character of the American fossil mammifers, &c. &c., that I
determined to collect blindly every sort of fact, which could
bear any way on what are species. I have read heaps of
agricultural and horticultural books, and have never ceased
collecting facts. At last gleams of light have come, and I am
almost convinced (quite contrary to the opinion I started
with) that species are not (it is like confessing a murder)
immutable. Heaven forfend me from Lamarck nonsense of
a  tendency to progression,  adaptations from the slow
willing of animals, Sic. ! But the conclusions I am led to are
not widely different from his ; though the means of change
are wholly so. I think I have found out (heres presump-
tion!) the simple way by which species become exquisitely
adapted to various ends. You will now groan, and think to

and writing to." I should, five years ago, have thought
[The following letter written on February 23, 1S44, shows
that the acquaintanceship with Sir J. D. Hooker was then
fast ripening into friendship. The letter is chiefly of interest
as showing the sort of problems then occupying my fathers
mind :]
Dear Hooker,  I hope you will excuse the freedom of my
address, but I feel that as co-circum-wanderers and as fellow
labourers (though myself a very weak one) we may throw
aside some of the old-world formality. ... I have just finished
a little volume on the volcanic islands which we visited. I
do not know how far you care for dry simple geology, but I
hope you will let me send you a copy. I suppose I can send
it from London by common coach conveyance.
... I am going to ask you some more questions, though 1
dare say, without asking them, I shall see answers in your
work, when published, which will be quite time enough for
my purposes. First for the Galapagos, you will see in my
Journal, that the Birds, though peculiar species, have a most
obvious S. American aspect : I have just ascertained the
same thing holds good with the sea-shells. Is it so with
those plants which are peculiar to this archipelago ; you state
that their numerical proportions are continental (is not this a
very curious fact?) but are they related in forms to S.
America. Do you know of any other case of an archipelago,
with the separate islands possessing distinct representative
species ? I have always intended (but have not yet done so)
to examine Webb and Berthelot on the Canary Islands for
this object. Talking with Mr. Bentham, he told me that the
separate islands of the Sandwich Archipelago possessed
distinct representative species of the same genera of Labiatae :
would not this be worth your enquiry? How is it with the
1844-]
GALAPAGOS FLORA.
25
Azores ; to be sure the heavy western gales would tend to
diffuse the same species over that group.
I hope you will (I dare say my hope is quite superfluous)
attend to this general kind of affinity in isolated islands,
though I suppose it is more difficult to perceive this sort of
relation in plants, than in birds or quadrupeds, the groups of
which are, I fancy, rather more confined. Can St. Helena
be classed, though remotely, either with Africa or S. America ?
From some facts, which I have collected, I have been led to
conclude that the fauna of mountains are either remarkably
siinilar (sometimes in the presence of the same species and at
other times of same genera), or that they are remarkably
dissimilar ; and it has occurred to me that possibly part of
this peculiarity of the St Helena and Galapagos floras may
be attributed to a great part of these two Floras being
mountain Floras. I fear my notes will hardly serve to dis-
tinguish much of the habitats of the Galapagos plants, but
they may in some cases ; most, if not all, of the green, leafy
plants come from the summits of the islands, and the thin
brown leafless plants come from the lower arid parts : would
you be so kind as to bear this remark in mind, when ex-
amining my collection.
1 will trouble you with only one other question. In dis-
cussion with Mr. Gould, I found that in most of the genera
of birds which range over the whole or greater part of the
world, the individual species have wider ranges, thus the Owl
is mundane, and many of the species have very wide ranges.
So I believe it is with land and fresh-water shells  and I
might adduce other cases. Is it not so with Cryptogamic
plants ; have not most of the species wide ranges, in those
genera which are mundane ? I do not suppose that the
converse holds, viz.  that when a species has a wide range,
its genus also ranges wide. Will you so far oblige me by
occasionally thinking over this? It would cost me vast
trouble to get a list of mundane phanerogamic genera and
26 GROWTH OF THE ORIGIN. [1844.
then search how far the species of these genera are apt to
range wide in their several countries ; but you might occa-
sionally, in the course of your pursuits, just bear this in mind,
though perhaps the point may long since have occurred to
you or other Botanists, Geology is bringing to light interest-
ing facts, concerning the ranges of shells ; I think it is pretty
well established, that according as the geographical range of
a species is wide, so is its persistence and duration in time.
I hope you will try to grudge as little as you can the trouble
of my letters, and pray believe me very truly yours,
C. Darwin.
P.S. I should feel extremely obliged for your kind offer of
the sketch of Humboldt ; I venerate him, and after having had
the pleasure of conversing with him in London, I shall still
more like to have any portrait of him.
[What follows is quoted from Sir J. D. Hookers notes.
" The next act in the drama of our lives opens with personal
intercourse. This began with an invitation to breakfast with
him at his brothers (Erasmus Darwins) house in Park Street ;
which was shortly afterwards followed by an invitation to
Down to meet a few brother Naturalists. In the short
intervals of good health that followed the long illnesses which
oftentimes rendered life a burthen to him, between 1844 apd
1847, I had many such invitations, and delightful they were.
A more hospitable and more attractive home under every
point of view could not be imagined of Society there were

always left with the feeling that I had imparted nothing and
carried away more than I could stagger under. Latterly, as
his health became more seriously affected, I was for days and
weeks the only visitor, bringing my work with me and
enjoying his society as opportunity offered. It was .an
established rule that he every day pumped me, as he called
it, for half an hour or so after breakfast in his study, when
he first brought out a heap of slips with questions botanical,
geographical, &c., for me to answer, and concluded by telling
me of the progress he had made in his own work, asking my
opinion on various points. I saw no more of him till about
noon, when I heard his mellow ringing voice calling my
name under my window  this was to join him in his daily
forenoon walk round the sand-tvalk.* On joining him I
found him in a rough grey shooting-coat in summer, and
thick cape over his shoulders in winter, and a stout staff in
his hand ; away we trudged through the garden, where there
was always some experiment to visit, and on to the sand-
walk, round which a fixed number of turns were taken, during
which our conversation usually ran on foreign lands and seas,
old friends, old books, and things far off to both mind and

if not, he generally managed to appear in the drawing-room,

of my fathers views, and the nature of his work during this

, . . The conclusion, which I have come at is, that those
areas, in which species are most numerous, have oftenest
been divided and isolated from other areas, united and again
divided ; a process implying antiquity and some changes in
the external conditions. This will justly sound very hypo-
thetical. I cannot give my reasons in detail ; but the most
general conclusion, which the geographical distribution of all
organic beings, appears to me to indicate, is that isolation is
the chief .concomitant or cause of the appearance of 7iew
forms (I well know there are some staring exceptions).
Secondly, from seeing how often the plants and animals
swarm in a country, when introduced into it, and from see-
ing what] a vast number of plants will live, for instance in
England, if kept free from weeds, and native plants, I have
been led to consider that the spreading and number of the
organic beings of' any country depend less on its external
features, than on the number of forms, which have been there
originally created or produced. I much doubt whether you
will find it possible to explain the number of forms by pro-
portional differences of exposure ; and I cannot doubt if
half the species in any country were destroyed or had not
been created, yet that country would appear to us fully
peopled. With respect to original creation or production of
new forms, I have said that isolation appears the chief ele-
ment. Hence, with respect to terrestrial productions, a tract
of country, which had oftenest within the late geological pe-
riods subsided and been converted into islands, and reunited,
I should expect to contain most forms.
But such speculations are amusing only to ones self, and in
this case useless, as they do not show any direct line of obser-
vation : if I had seen how hypothetical [is] the little, which I

i . . I forget my last letter, but it must have been a very
silly one, as it seems I gave my notion of the number of
species being in great degree governed by the degree to
which the area had been often isolated and divided ; I must
have been cracked to have written it, for I have no evidence,
without a person be willing to admit all my views, and then
it does follow ; but in my most sanguine moments, all I
expect, is that 1 shall be able to show even to sound Natur-
alists, that there are two sides to the question of the immut-
ability of species;  that facts can be viewed and grouped
under the notion of allied species having descended from
common stocks. With respect to books on this subject, I
do not know of any systematical ones, except Lamarcks,-
which is veritable rubbish ; but there are plenty, as Lyell,
Pritchard, &c., on the view of the immutability. Agassiz
lately has brought the strongest argument in favour of immut-
ability. Isidore Hilaire has written some good Essays,
tending towards the mutability-side, in the  Suites k Buffon,
entitled  Zoolog. G6n6ralc. Is it not strange that the author
of such a book as the  Animaux sans Vertibres  should
have written that insects, which never see their eggs, should
win (and plants, their seeds) to be of particular forms, so as
to become attached to particular objects. The other common
(specially Germanic) notion is hardly less absurd, viz. that
climate, food, &c., should make a Pediculus formed to climb
hair, or wood-pecker to climb trees. I believe all these
absurd views arise from no one having, as far as I know,
approached the subject on the side of variation under domest-

require, in my case, some leisure and energy, both of which
ingredients I have had none to spare, as writing my Geology
thoroughly expends both. I had always thought that I
would keep a journal and record everything, but in the way
I now live I find I observe nothing to record. Looking after
my garden and trees, and occasionally a very little walk in
an idle frame of my mind, fills up every afternoon in the
same manner. I am surprised that with all your parish

proud should I have been if I could have added a single fact
to it). My work on the species- question has impressed me
very forcibly with the importance of all such works as your
intended one, containing what people are pleased generally
to call trifling facts. These are the facts which make one
understand the working or economy of nature. There is one
subject, on which I am very curious, and which perhaps you
may throw some light on, if you have ever thought on it ;
namely, what are the checks and what the periods of life,
by which the increase of any given species is limited. Just
calculate the increase of any bird, if you assume that only
half the young are reared, and these breed : within the natural
{i.e. if free from accidents) life of the parents the number of
individuals will become enormous, and I have been much
surprised to think how great destruction must annually or
occasionally be falling on every species, yet the means and
period of such destruction is scarcely perceived by us.
I have continued steadily reading and collecting facts on
variation of domestic animals and plants, and on the question
of what are species. I have a grand body of facts, and I
think I can draw some sound conclusions. The general con-
clusions at which I have slowly been driven from $ directly
opposite conviction, is that species are mutable, and that
allied species are co-descendants from common stocks. I
know how much I open myself to reproach for such a con-
clusion, but I have at least honestly and deliberately come to
it I shall not publish on this subject for several years. At
present I am on the Geology of South America. I hope to
pick up from your book some facts on slight variations in
structure or instincts in the animals of your acquaintance.

My dear Jenyns,  I am very much obliged to you for
the trouble you have taken in having written me so long
a note. The question of where, when, and how the check
to the increase of a given species falls appears to me par
ticularly interesting, and our difficulty in answering it shows
how really ignorant we are of the lives and habits of our most
familiar species. I was aware of the bare fact of old birds
driving away their young, but had never thought of the effect
you so clearly point out, of local gaps in number being thus
immediately filled up. But the original difficulty remains ; for
if your farmers had not killed your sparrows and rooks, what
would have become of those which now immigrate into your
parish ? in the middle of England one is too far distant from
the natural limits of the rook and sparrow to suppose that
the young are thus far expelled from Cambridgeshire. The
check must fall heavily at some time of each species life ;
for, if one calculates that only half the progeny are reared
and bred, how enormous is the increase 1 One has, however,
no business to feel so much surprise at ones ignorance, when
one knows how impossible it is without statistics to con-
jecture the duration of life and percentage of deaths to births
in mankind. If it could be shown that apparently the birds
of passage which breed here and increase, return in the suc-
ceeding years in about the same number, whereas those that
come here for their winter and non-breeding season annually,
come here with the same numbers, but return with greatly
decreased numbers, one would know (as indeed seems
probable) that the check fell chiefly on full-grown birds
in the winter season, and not on the eggs and very young
birds, which has appeared to me often the most probable
period. If at any time any remarks on this subject should

have expressed myself with singular inaccuracy if I led you
to suppose that I meant to say that my conclusions were
inevitable. They have become so, after years of weighing
puzzles, to myself alone; but in my wildest day-dream, I
never expect more than to be able to show that there are
two sides to the question of the immutability of species,
i.e. whether species are directly created or by intermediate
laws (as with the life and death of individuals). 1 did not
approach the subject on the side of the difficulty in deter-
mining what are species and what are varieties, but (though
why I should give you such a history of my doings it would
be hard to say) from such facts as the relationship between
the living and extinct mammifers in South America, and
between those living on the Continent and on adjoining
islands, such as the Galapagos. It occurred to me that
a collection of all such analogous facts would throw light
either for or against the view of related species being co-
descendants from a common stock. A long searching
amongst agricultural and horticultural books and people
makes me believe (I well know how absurdly presumptuous
this must appear) that I see the way in which new varieties
become exquisitely adapted to the external conditions of life
and to other surrounding beings. I am a bold man to lay
myself open to being thought a complete fool, and a most
deliberate one. From the nature of the grounds which make
me believe that species are mutable in form, these grounds
cannot be restricted to the closest-allied species ; but how far
they extend I cannot tell, as my reasons fall away by degrees,
when applied to species more and more remote from each
other. Pray do not think that I am so blind as not to see
that there are numerous immense difficulties in my notions,
but they appear to me less than on the common view. I have

Down, Oct. 17th, 1846.
Dear Jenyns,  I have taken a most ungrateful length
of time in thanking you for your very kind present of
your  Observations. But I happened to have had in hand
several other books, and have finished yours only a few days
ago. I found it very pleasant reading, and many of your
facts interested me much. I think I wa^ more interested,
which is odd, with your notes on some of the lower animals
than on the higher ones. The introduction struck me as very
good ; but this is what I expected, for I well remember being
quite delighted with a preliminary essay to the first number
of the  Annals of Natural History. I missed one discussion,
and think myself ill-used, for I remember your saying you
would make some remarks on the weather and barometer,
as a guide for the ignorant in prediction. I had also hoped
to have perhaps met with some remarks on the amount of
variation in our common species. Andrew Smith once
declared he would get some hundreds of specimens of larks
and sparrows from all parts of Great Britain, and see whether,
with finest measurements, he could detect any proportional
variations in beaks or limbs, &c This point interests me
from having lately been skimming over the absurdly opposite
conclusions of Gloger and Brehm ; the one making half-a-
dozen species out of every common bird, and the other
D 2

turning so many reputed species into one. Have you ever
done anything of this kind, or have you ever studied Glogers
or Brehms works ? I was interested in your account of the
martins, for I had just before been utterly perplexed by
noticing just such a proceeding as you describe : I counted
seven, one day lately, visiting a single nest and sticking dirt
on the adjoining wall. I may mention that I once saw some
squirrels eagerly splitting those little semi-transparent
spherical galls on the back of oak-leaves for the maggot
within ; so that they are insectivorous. A Cychrus rostratus
once squirted into-my eyes and gave me e.Ntreme pain ; and
I must tell you what happened to me on the banks of the
Cam, in my early entomological days : under a piece of
bark I found two Carabi (I forget which), and caught one in
each hand, when lo and behold I saw a sacred Panageeus crux
major ! I could not bear to give up either of my Carabi, and
to lose PatMgteus was out of the question ; so that in despair
I gently seized one of the Carabi between my teeth, when to
my unspeakable disgust and pain the little inconsiderate
beast squirted his acid down my throat, and I lost both Carabi
and PanagcBus ! I was quite astonished to hear of a terres-
trial Planaria ; for about a year or two ago I described in the
Annals of Natural History several beautifully coloured
terrestrial species of the Southern Hemisphere, and thought it
quite a new fact. By the way, you speak of a sheep with a
broken leg not having flukes : I have heard my father aver
that a fever, or any serious accident, as a broken limb, will
cause in a man all the intestinal worms to be evacuated.
Might not this possibly have been the case with the flukes in
their early state ?

P.S.  I have quite forgotten to say how greatly interested I
was with your discussion on the statistics of animals : when
will Natural History be so perfect that such points as you
discuss will be perfectly known about any one animal ?
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to J. D. Hooker.
Malvern, June 13 [1849].
... At last I am going to press with a small poor
first-fruit of my confounded Cirripedia, viz. the fossil ped-
unculate cirripedia. You ask what effect studying species
has had on my variation theories ; I do not think much  I
have felt some difficulties more. On the other hand, I have
been struck (and probably unfairly from the class) with the
variability of every part in some slight degree of every
species. When the same organ is rigorously compared in
many individuals, I always find some slight variability, and
consequently that the diagnosis of species from minute
differences is always dangerous. I had thought the same
parts of the same species more resemble (than they do
anyhow in Cirripedia) objects cast in the same mould.
Systematic work would be easy were it not for this con-
founded variation, which, however, is pleasant to me as
a spcculatist, though odious to me as a systematist. Your
remarks on the distinctness (so unpleasant to me) of the
Himalayan Rubi, willows, &c., compared with those of
northern [Europe ?], &c., are very interesting ; if my rude

Down, Wednesday, [September, n. d.]
. . . Many thanks for your letter received yesterday, which,
as always, set me thinking : I laughed at your attack at my
stinginess in changes of level towards Forbes,* being so
liberal towards myself; but I must maintain, that I have
never let down or upheaved our mother-earths surface, for
the sake of explaining any one phenomenon, and I trust I
have very seldom done so without some distinct evidence.
So I must still think it a bold step (perhaps a very true one)
to sink into the depths of ocean, within the period of existing
species, so large a tract of surface. But there is no amount
or extent of change of level, which I am not fully prepared
to admit, but I must say I should like better evidence, than
the identity of a few plants, which possibly (I do not say
probably) might have been otherwise transported. Particular

thanks for your attempt to get me a copy of  LEspfece, * and
almost equal thanks for your criticisms on him : I rather
misdoubted him, and felt not much inclined to take as gospel
his facts. I find this one of my greatest difficulties with
foreign authors, viz. judging of their credibility. How pain-
fully (to me) true is your remark, that no one has hardly a
right to e.xamine the question of species who has not minutely
described many. I was, however, pleased to hear from Owen
(who is vehemently opposed to any mutability in species),
that he thought it was a very fair subject, and that there
was a mass of facts to be brought to bear on the question,
not hitherto collected. My only comfort is (as I mean to
attempt the subject), that I have dabbled in several branches
of Natural History, and seen good specific men work out my
species, and know something of geology (an indispensable
union) ; and though I shall get more kicks than half-pennies,
I will, life serving, attempt my work. Lamarck is the only
exception, that I can think of, of an accurate describer of
species, at least in the Invertebrate Kingdom, who has dis-
believed in permanent species, but he in his absurd though
clever work has done the subject harm, as has Mr. Vestiges,
and, as (some future loose naturalist attempting the same
speculations will perhaps say) has Mr. D. . , .

I really suspect there is something absolutely opposed to each
other and hostile in the two frames of mind required for
systematising and reasoning on large collections of facts.
Many of your arguments appear to me very well put, and,
as far as my experience goes, the candid way in which you
discuss the subject is unique. The whole will be very useful
to me whenever I undertake my volume, though parts take
the wind very completely out of my sails ; it will be all nuts
to me ... for I have for some time determined to give the
arguments on both sides (as far as I could), instead of arguing
on the mutability side alone.
In my own Cirripedial work (by the way, thank you for
the dose of soft solder ; it does one  or at least me  a great
deal of good)  in my own work I have not felt conscious
that disbelieving in the mere permanence of species has made
much difference one way or the other ; in some few cases
(if publishing avowedly on the doctrine of non-permanence),
I should not have affixed names, and in some few cases
should have affixed names to remarkable varieties. Certainly
I have felt it humiliating, discussing and doubting, and
examining over and over again, when in my own mind the
only doubt has been whether the form varied to-day or
yesterday (not to put too fine a point on it, as Snagsby  would
say). After describing a set of forms as distinct species, tearing
up my MS., and making them one species, tearing that up
and making them separate, and then making them one
again (which has happened to me), I have gnashed my
teeth, cursed species, and asked what sin I had committed
to be so punished. But I must confess that perhaps nearly
the same thing would have happened to me on any scheme
of work.

My dear Hooker,  I have no remarks at all worth
sending you, nor, indeed, was it likely that I should, con-
sidering how perfect and elaborated an essay it is.* As far
as my judgment goes, it is the most important discussion
on the points in question ever published. I can say no more.
I agree with almost eveiything you say ; but I require much
time to digest an essay of such quality. It almost made me
gloomy, partly from feeling I could not answer some points
which theoretically I should have liked to have been different,
and partly from seeing so far better done than I could have
done, discussions on some points which I had intended to
have taken up. . . .
I much enjoyed the slaps you have given to the provincial
species-mongers. I wish I could have been of the slightest
use : I have been deeply interested by the whole essay, and
congratulate you on having produced a memoir which I
believe will be memorable. I was deep in it when your
most considerate note arrived, begging me not to hurry. I

My dear Hooker,  I had hoped that you would have
had a little breathing-time after your Journal, but this seems
to be very far from the case ; and I am the more obliged
(and somewhat contrite) for the long letter received this
morning, wwj; juicy with news and most interesting to me in
many ways. I am very glad indeed to hear of the reforms,
&c., in the Royal Society. With respect to the Club,* I am
deeply interested ; only two or three days ago, I was regretting
to my wife, how I was letting drop and being dropped by
nearly all my acquaintances, and that I would endeavour to
go oftener to London ; I was not then thinking of the Club,
which, as far as any one thing goes, would answer my exact
object in keeping up old and making some new acquaintances.
I will therefore come up to London for every (with rare
exceptions) Club-day, and then my head, I think, will allow [
me on an average to go to every other meeting. But it is
 The Philosophical Club, to
which my father was elected (as
Professor Bonney is good enough
to inform me) on April 34, 1854. He
resigned his membership in 1864.
The Club was founded in 1847.
The number of members being
limited to 47, it was proposed to
christen it the Club of 47," but
the name was never adopted. The
nature of the Club maybe gathered
from its first rule : The purpose
of the Club is to promote as much
as possible the scientific objects of
intercourse between those Fellows
who are actively engaged in culti-
vating the various branches of
Natural Science, and who have
contributed to its progress ; to in-
crease the attendance at the evening
meetings, and to encourage the
contribution and discussion of
papers. The Club met for dinner
at 6, and the chair was to be
quitted at 8. 15, it being expected
that members would go to the
Royal Society. Of late years the
dinner has been at 6 . 30, the Society

pledge myself, as I told Lyell, to resign after a year, if I did
not attend pretty often, so that I should at worst encumber
the Club temporarily. If you can get me elected, I certainly

so very soon ; but am not surprised, for I have heard of
several, in our small circle, reading it with very much pleasure.
I shall be curious to hear what Humboldt will say : it will, I
should think, delight him, and meet with more praise from
him than any other book of Travels, for I cannot remember
one, which has so many subjects in common with him. What
a wonderful old fellow he is By the way, I hope,
when you go to Hitcham.f towards the end of May, you will
be forced to have some rest. I am grieved to hear that all
the bad symptoms have not left Henslow ; it is so strange
and new to feel any uneasiness about his health. I am
particularly obliged to you for sending me Asa Grays letter ;
how very pleasantly he writes. To see his and your caution
on the species-question ought to overwhelm me in confusion
and shame ; it does make me feel deuced uncomfortable. . . .
It is delightful to hear all that he says on Agassiz : how very
singular it is that so eminently clever a man, with such
immense knowledge on many branches of Natural History,
should write as he does. Lyell told me that he was so
delighted with one of his (Agassiz) lectures on progressive
development, Stc. &c., that he went to him aftenvards and
told him,  that it was so delightful, that he could not help
all the time wishing it was true. I seldom see a Zoological
paper from North America, without observing the impress of
Agassiz doctrines,  another proof, by the way, of how great
a man he is. I was pleased and surprised to see A. Grays
remarks on crossing, obliterating varieties, on which, as you
know, I have been collecting facts for these dozen years.

very curious point in the astounding proportion of Coleoptera
that are apterous ; and I think I have guessed the reason,
viz. that powers of flight would be injurious to insects inhab-
iting a confined locality, and expose them to be blown to the
sea ; to test this, I find that the insects inhabiting the Dezerte
Grande, a quite small islet, would be still more exposed to
this danger, and here the proportion of apterous insects is
even considerably greater than on Madeira proper. Wollaston
speaks of Madeira and the other Archipelagoes as being
sure and certain witnesses of Forbes old continent, and of
course the Entomological world implicitly follows this vie\v.
But to my eyes it would be difficult to imagine facts more
opposed to such a view. It is really disgusting and humil-
iating to see directly opposite conclusions drawn from the
same facts.
I have had some correspondence with Wollaston on this
and other subjects, and I find that he coolly assumes, (l) that
formerly insects possessed greater migratory powers than
now, (2) that the old land was specially rich in centres of
creation, (3) that the uniting land was destroyed before the
special creations had time to diffuse, and (4) that the land
was broken down before certain families and genera had
time to reach from Europe or Africa the points of land in
question. Are not these a jolly lot of assumptions ? and yet

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to JV. D. Fox.
Down, March 19th [1855].
My dear Fox,  How long it is since we have had any
communication, and I really want to hear how the world
goes with you ; but my immediate object is to ask you to
observe a point for me, and as I know now you are a very
busy man with too much to do, I shall have a good chance
of your doing what I want, as it would be hopeless to ask a
quite idle man. As you have a Noahs Ark, I do not doubt
that you have pigeons. (How I wish by any chance they were
fantails !) Now what I want to know is, at what age nestling
pigeons have their tail feathers sufficiently developed to be
counted. I do not think I ever saw a young pigeon. I am
hard at work at my notes collecting and comparing them, in
order in some two or three years to write a book with all the
facts and arguments, which I can collect, for and versus the
immutability of species. I want to get the young of our
domestic breeds, to see how young, and to what degree the
differences appear. I must either breed myself (which is no
amusement but a horrid bore to me) the pigeons or buy their
young ; and before I go to a seller, whom I have heard of
from Yarrell, I am really anxious to know something about
their development, not to expose my excessive ignorance,
and therefore be excessively liable to be cheated and gulled.
With respect to the one point of the tail feathers, it is of
course in relation to the wonderful development of tail feathers
in the adult fantail. If you had any breed of poultry pure, I

would beg a chicken with exact age stated, about a week or fort-
night old ! to be sent in a box by post, if you could have the heart
to kill one ; and secondly, would let me pay postage . . . Indeed,
I should be very glad to have a nestling common pigeon sent,
for I mean to make skeletons, and have already just begun
comparing wild and tame ducks. And I think the results
rather curious,* for on weighing the several bones very care-
fully, when perfectly cleaned the proportional weights of the
two have greatly varied, the foot of the tame having largely
increased. How I wish I could get a little wild duck of a
week old, but that I know is almost impossible.
With respect to ourselves, I have not much to say; we
have now a terribly noisy house with the whooping cough,
but otherwise are ail well. Far the greatest fact about myself
is that I have at last quite done with the everlasting barnacles.
At the end of the year we had t\vo of our little boys very ill
with fever and bronchitis, and all sorts of ailments. Partly
for amusement, and partly for change of air, we went to
London and took a house for a month, but it turned out
a great failure, for that dreadful frost just set in when we
went, and all our children got unwell, and E. and I had
coughs and colds and rheumatism nearly all the time. We
had put down first on our list of things to do, to go and
see Mrs. Fox, but literally after waiting some time to see
whether the weather would not improve, we had not a day
when we both could go out.

to pay us a visit. Time is slipping away, and we are

about the young pigeons ; and anyhow do write before very

My dear Fox, your sincere old friend,
C. Darwin.
P.S.  Amongst all sorts of odds and ends, with which I am
amusing myself, I am comparing the seeds of the variations
of plants. I had formerly some wild cabbage seeds, which I
gave to some one, was it to you ? It is a thousand to one it
was thrown away, if not I should be very glad of a pinch of it.
[CTTXTHR The following extract from a letter to Mr. Fox (March 27th,
1855) refers to the same subject as the last letter, and gives
some account of the species work: The way I shall kill
young things will be to put them under a tumbler glass with a
teaspoon of ether or chloroform, the glass being pressed down
on some yielding surface, and leave them for an hour or two,
young have such power of revivification. (I have thus killed
moths and butterflies.) The best way would be to send them
as you procure them, in pasteboard chip-boxes by post, on
which you could write and just tie up with string ; and you will
really make me happier by allowing me to keep an account
of postage, &c. Upon my word I can hardly believe that
any one could be so good-natured as to take such trouble
and do such a very disagreeable thing as kill babies ; and I
am very sure I do not know one soul who, except yourself,
would do so. I am going to ask one thing more ; should
old hens of any above poultry (not duck) die or become so
old as to be useless, I wish you would send her to me per
rail, addressed to  C. Danvin, care of Mr. Acton, Post-office,
Bromley, Kent. Will you keep this address I as shortest
way for parcels. But I do not care so much for this, as I
could buy the old birds dead at Bailys to make skeletons.

I forget whether I ever told you what the object of my

(ehcu, cheu, how ignorant I find I am) in Natural History
(as on geographical distribution, palaeontology, classification,
hybridism, domestic animals and plants, &c. &c. 8:c.) to see
how far they favour or are opposed to the notion that wild
species are mutable or immutable : I mean with my utmost
power to give all arguments and facts on both sides. I have
a number of people helping me in every way, and giving me
most valuable assistance; but I often doubt whether the
subject will not quite overpower me.

home on Saturday after a weeks work in London. Whilst
there I saw Yarrell, who told me he had carefully examined
all points in the Call Duck, and did not feel any doubt
about it being specifically identical, and that it had crossed
freely with common varieties in St. Jamess Park. I should
therefore be very glad for a seven-days duckling and for one
of the old birds, should one ever die a natural death. Yarrell
told me that Sabine had collected forty varieties of the
common duck 1 . . . Well, to return to business ; nobody, I am
sure, could fix better for me than you the characteristic age of
little chickens ; with respect to skeletons, I have feared it
would be impossible to make them, but I suppose I shall be
able to measure limbs, &c., by feeling the joints. What you
say about old cocks just confirms what I thought, and I will
make my skeletons of old cocks. Should an old wild turkey
ever die, please remember me ; I do not care for a baby tur-
key, nor for a mastiff. Very many thanks for your offer. I
have puppies of bull-dogs and greyhound in salt, and I have
had cart-horse and race-horse young colts carefully mea-
sured. Whether I shall do any good I doubt. I am getting
out of my depth. Most truly yours,
C. Darwin.
[CTTXTHR An extract from a letter to Mr. Fox may find a place

 Many thanks for the seven days old white Dorking, and
for the other promised ones. I am getting quite  a chamber
of horrors ;  I appreciate your kindness even more than
before, for I have done the black deed and murdered an
angelic little fantail, and a pouter at ten days old. I tried
chloroform and ether for the first, and though evidently a
perfectly easy death, it was prolonged ; and for the second 1

and the prussic acid gas thus generated was very quickly
fatal.
A letter to Mr. Fox (May 23rd, 1855) gives the first
mention of my fathers laborious piece of work on the
breeding of pigeons :
 I write now to say that I have been looking at some of
our mongrel chickens, and I should say otie week old would
do very well. The chief points which I am, and have been
for years, very curious about, is to ascertain whether the
young of our domestic breeds differ as much from each other
as do their parents, and I have no faith in anything short
of actual measurement and the Rule of Three. I hope and
believe I am not giving so much trouble without a motive of
sufficient worth. I have got my fantails and pouters (choice
birds, I hope, as I paid 20r. for each pair from Baily) in a
grand cage and pigeon-house, and they are a decided amuse-
ment to me, and delight to H.
In the course of my father's pigeon-fancying enterprise he
necessarily became acquainted with breeders, and was fond of
relating his experiences as a member of the Columbarian
and Philoperistera Clubs, where he met the purest enthusiasts
of the  fancy," and learnt much of the mysteries of their art.
CTTXTHR In writing to Mr. Huxley some years aftenvards, he quotes
from a book on Pigeons by Mr. J. Eaton, in illustration of
the  extreme attention and close observation  necessary to
be a good fancier.
 In his [Mr. Eatons] treatise, devoted to the Almond
Tumbler alone, which is a sub-variety of the short-faced
variety, which is a variety of the Tumbler, as that is of the
Rock-pigeon, Mr. Eaton says :  There are some of the
young fanciers who are over-covetous, who go for all the
five properties at once (/.e. the five characteristic points
which are mainly attended to,  C. D.), they have their reward
E 2

by getting nothing. In short, it is almost beyond the human
intellect to attend to all the excellencies of the Almond
Tumbler !
" To be a good breeder, and to succeed in improving any
breed, beyond everything enthusiasm is required. Mr. Eaton
has gained lots of prizes, listen to him.
  If it was possible for noblemen and gentlemen to know
the amazing amount of solace and pleasure derived from the
Almond Tumbler, when they begin to understand their (��>.
the tumblers) properties, I should think that scarce any
nobleman or gentleman would be without their aviaries of
Almond Tumblers.
My father was fond of quoting this passage, and always
with a tone of fellow-feeling for the author, though, no doubt,
he had forgotten his own wonderings as a child that  every
gentleman did not become an ornithologist.  (Autobio-
graphy, p. 35.)
To Mr. W. B. Tegetmeier, the well-known writer on poultry,
&c., he was indebted for constant advice and co-operation.
Their correspondence began in 1855, and lasted to 1881,
when my father wrote :  I can assure you that I often look
back with pleasure to the old days when I attended to
pigeons, fowls, 8:c., and when you gave me such valuable
assistance. I not rarely regret that I have had so little
strength that I have not been able to keep up old acquaint-
ances and friendships. CTTXTHR My fathers letters to Mr. Teget-
meier consist  almost entirely of series of questions relating
to the different breeds of fowls, pigeons, &c., and are not,
therefore, interesting. In reading through the pile of letters,
one is much struck by the diligence of the writers search for
facts, and it is made clear that Mr. Tegetmeiers knowledge
and judgment were completely trusted and highly valued by
him. Numerous phrases, such as  your note is a mine of
wealth to me, occur, expressing his sense of the value of
Mr. Tegetmeiers help, as well as words expressing his warm

appreciation of Mr. Tegetmeiers unstinting zeal and kindness,
or his  pure and disinterested love of science. On the
subject of hive-bees and their combs, Mr. Tegetmeiers help
was also valued by my father, who wrote, your paper on
 Bees-cells, read before the British Association, was highly
useful and suggestive to me.
To work out the problems on the Geographical Distri-
butions of animals and plants on evolutionary principles, he
had to study the means by which seeds, eggs, &c., can be
transported across wide spaces of ocean. It was this need
which gave an interest to the class of experiment to which
the following letters allude.]
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to W. D. Fox.
Down, May 17th [1855].
My dear Fox,  ^You will hate the very sight of my hand-
writing ; but after this time I promise I will ask for nothing
more, at least for a long time. As you live on sandy soil,
have you lizards at all common ? If you have, should you
think it too ridiculous to offer a reward for me for lizards
eggs to the boys in your school ; a shilling for every half-
dozen, or more if rare, till you got two or three dozen and
send them to me? If snakes eggs were brought in mistake
it would be very well, for I want such also ; and we have
neither lizards nor snakes about here. My object is to see
whether such eggs will float on sea water, and whether they
will keep alive thus floating for a month or two in my cellar.
I am tiying experiments on transportation of all organic
beings that I can ; and lizards are found on every island, and
therefore I am very anxious to see whether their eggs stand
sea water. Of course this note need not be answered, without,
by a strange and favourable chance, you can some day answer
it with the eggs. Your most troublesome friend,
C. Darwin.

... I have had one experiment some little time in
progress which will, I think, be interesting, namely, seeds
in salt water, immersed in water of 32��-33, which I have
and shall long have, as I hlled a great tank with snow.
When I wrote last I was going to triumph over you, for my
experiment had in a slight degree succeeded ; but this, with
infinite baseness, I did not tell, in hopes that you would
say that you would eat all the plants which I could raise
after immersion. It is very aggravating that I cannot in
the least remember what you did formerly say that made me
think you scoffed at the experiments vastly; for you now
seem to view the experiment like a good Christian. I have
in small bottles out of doors, exposed to variation of tempera-
ture, cress, radish, cabbages, lettuces, carrots, and celery, and
onion seed  four great families. These, after immersion for
exactly one week, have all germinated, which I did not in the
least expect (and thought how you would sneer at me) ; for
the water of nearly all, and of the cress especially, smelt
very badly, and the cress seed emitted a wonderful quantity
of mucus (the  Vestiges  would have expected them to turn
into tadpoles), so as to adhere in a mass ; but these seeds
germinated and grew splendidly. The germination of all
(especially cress and lettuces) has been accelerated, except the
cabbages, which have come up very irregularly, and a good
many, I think, dead. One would have thought, from their
native habitat, that the cabbage would have stood well. The
Umbelliferae and onions seem to stand the salt well. I wash
the seed before planting them. I have written to the
Gardeners' Chronicle* though I doubt whether it was worth

send a seed list, to get you to mark some different classes
of seeds. To-day I replant the same seeds as above after
fourteen days immersion. As many sea-currents go a mile
an hour, even in a week they might be transported 168 miles ;
the Gulf Stream is said to go fifty and sixty miles a day.

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to J. D. Hooker.

. . . You are a good man to confess that you expected the
cress would be killed in a week, for this gives me a nice little
triumph. The children at first were tremendously eager, and
asked me often, whether I should beat Dr. Hooker! The
cress and lettuce have just vegetated well after twenty-one
days immersion. But I will write no more, which is a great
virtue in me ; for it is to me a very great pleasure telling you
everything I do.
... If you knew some of the experiments (if they may be
so called) which] I am trying, you would have a good right
to sneer, for they are so absurd even in my opinion that I dare
not tell you.
Have not some men a nice notion of experimentising ?
I have had a letter telling me that seeds 7nust have great
power of resisting salt water, for otherwise how could they
get to islands ? This is the true way to solve a problem !

for showing your satisfaction in confounding my experiments,
I assure you I am quite enough confounded  those horrid

I have written to Scoresby and have had a rather dry
answer, but very much to the purpose, and giving me nO
hopes of any law unknown to me which might arrest their
everlasting descent into the deepest depths of the ocean. By
the way it was very odd, but I talked to Col. Sabine for half
an hour on the subject, and could not make him see with
respect to transportal the difficulty of the sinking questipn 1
The bore is, if the confounded seeds will sink, I have been
taking all this trouble in salting the ungrateful rascals for
nothing.
Everything has been going wrong with me lately ; the fish
at the Zoolog. Soc. ate up lots of soaked seeds, and in
imagination they had in my mind been swallowed, fish and
all, by a heron, had been carried a hundred miles, been
voided on the banks of some other lake and germinated
splendidly, when lo and behold, the fish ejected vehemently,
and with disgust equal to my own, all the seeds from their
mouths.*
But I am not going to give up the floating yet ; in first
place I must try fresh seeds, though of course it seems far
more probable that they will sink ; and secondly, as a last
resource, I must believe in the pod or even whole plant or
branch being washed into the sea ; with floods and slips and

I had intended to have asked you whether the Mimosa

If you have several of the Loffbden seeds, do soak some in

its success.
My DEAR Hooker,  I have just received your note. I
am most sincerely and heartily glad at the news * it contains,
and so is my wife. Though the income is but a poor one,
yet the certainty, I hope, is satisfactory to yourself and Mrs.
Hooker. As it must lead in future years to the Directorship,
I do hope you look at it as a piece of good fortune. For my
own taste I cannot fancy a pleasanter position, than the Head
of such a noble and splendid place ; far better, I should think,
than a Professorship in a great town. The more I think of
it, the gladder I am. But I will say no more ; except that I
hope Mrs. Hooker is pretty well pleased. . . .
As the Gardeuerd Chronicle put in my question, and

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to Asa Gray.
Down, June 8th [1855].
My dear Sir,  I thank you cordially for your remarkably
kind letter of the 22nd ult., and for the extremely pleasant
and obliging manner in which you have taken my rather
troublesome questions. I can hardly tell you how much
your list of Alpine plants has interested me, and I can now
in some degree picture to myself the plants of your Alpine
summits. The new edit, of your Manual is capital news for
me. I know from your preface how pressed you are for
room, but it would take no space to append (Eu) in brackets
to any European plant, and, as far as I am concerned, this
would answer every purpose.* From my own experience,
whilst making out English plants in our manuals, it has often
struck me how much interest it would give if some notion
of their range had been given ; and so, I cannot doubt, your
American inquirers and beginners would much like to know
which of their plants were indigenous and which European.
Would it not be well in the Alpine plants to append the very
same addition which you have now sent me in MS. ? though
here, owing to your kindness, I do not speak selfishly, but
merely pro bono Americano publico. I presume it would be
too troublesome to give in your manual the habitats of those
plants found west of the Rocky Mountains, and likewise those
found in Eastern Asia, taking the Yenesel (?),  which, if I
remember right, according to Gmelin, is the main partition

line of Siberia. Perhaps Siberia more concerns the northern
Flora of Nortli America. The ranges of the plants to the
east and west, viz. whether most found are in Greenland and
Western Europe, or in E. Asia, appears to me a very interest-
ing point as tending to show whether the migration has been
eastward or westward. Pray believe me that I am most
entirely conscious that the only use of these remarks is to
show a botanist what points a non-botanist is curious to
learn ; for I think every one who studies profoundly a subject
often becomes unaware [on] what points the ignorant require
information. I am so very glad that you think of drawing up
some notice on your geographical distribution, for the area
of the Manual strikes me as in some points better adapted
for comparison with Europe than that of the whole of North
America. You ask me to state definitely some of the points
on which I much wish for information ; but I really hardly
can, for they are so vague ; and I rather wish to see what
results will come out from comparisons, than have as yet
defined objects. I presume that, like other botanists, you
would give, for your area, the proportion (leaving out intro-
duced plants) to the whole of the great leading families : this
is one point I had intended (and, indeed, have done roughly)
to tabulate from your book, but of course I could have done
it only very imperfectly. I should also, of course, have ascer-
tained the proportion, to the whole Flora, of the European
plants (leaving out introduced) and of the separate great
families, in order to .speculate on means of transportal. By
the way, I ventured to send a few days ago a copy of the
Gardeners' Chronicle with a short report by me of some
trifling experiments which I have been trying on the power
of seeds to withstand sea water. I do not know whether
it has struck you, but it has me, that it would be advisable
for botanists to give in whole numbers, as well as in the
lowest fraction, the proportional numbers of the families, thus
I make out from your Manual that of the indigenous plants
iSSSj SUGGESTIONS AND QUERIES. 63
tlie proportion of the Umbelliferae are =-^ ; for, without
one knows the wlwle numbers, one cannot judge how really
close the numbers of the plants of the same family are in two
distant countries ; but very likely you may think this super-
fluous. Mentioning these proportional numbers, I may give
you an instance of the sort of points, and how vague and
futile they often are, which I attempt to work out . . . ;
reflecting on R. Browns and Hookers remark, that near
identity of proportional numbers of the great families in two
countries, shows probably that they were once continuously
united, I thought I would calculate the proportions of, for
instance, the introduced Composite in Great Britain to all the
introduced plants, and the result was In our abori-
ginal or indigenous flora the proportion is ; and in many
other cases I found an equally striking correspondence. I
then took your Manual, and worked out the same question ;
here I find in the Compositae an almost equally striking
correspondence, viz. in the introduced plants, and
=-i- in the indigenous; but when I came to the other
families I found the proportion entirely different, shomng
that the coincidences in the British Flora were probably
accidental !
You will, I presume, give the proportion of the species
to the genera, ��>. show on an average how many species each
genus contains ; though I have done this for myself.
If it would not be too troublesome, do you not think it would
be very interesting, and give a very good idea of your Flora,
to divide the species into three groups, viz. (a) species com-
mon to the old world, stating numbers common to Europe
and Asia ; {b) indigenous species, but belonging to genera
found in the Old World ; and (c) species belonging to genera
confined to America or the New World ? To make (according
to my ideas) perfection perfect, one ought to be told whether
there are other cases, like Erica, of genera common in Europe
or in Old World not found in your area. But honestly I feel
64 GROWTH OF THE ORIGIN. [1855.
that it is quite ridiculous my writing to you at such length on
the subject ; but, as you have asked me, I do it gratefully, and
write to you as I should to Hooker, who often laughs at me
unmercifully, and I am sure you have better reason to do so.
There is one point on which I am most anxious for inform-
ation, and I mention it with the greatest hesitation, and
only in the full belief that you will believe me that I have
not the folly and presumption to hope for a second that you
will give it, without you can with very little trouble. The
point can at present interest no one but myself, which makes
the case wholly different from geographical distribution. The
only way in which, I think, you possibly could do it with little
trouble would be to bear in mind, whilst correcting your proof-
sheets of the Manual, my question and put a cross or mark
to the species, and whenever sending a parcel to Hooker to
let me have such old sheets. But this would give you the
trouble of remembering my question, and I can hardly hope
or expect that you will do it But I will just mention what I
want ; it is to have marked the  close species  in a Flora, so
as to compare in different Floras whether the same genera
have close species, and for other purposes too vague to
enumerate. I have attempted, by Hookers help, to ascertain
in a similar way whether the different species of the same
genera in distant quarters of the globe are variable or
present varieties; The definition I should give of a ''close
species" was one that you thought specifically distinct, but
which you could conceive some other good botanist might
think only a race or variety ; or, again, a species that you
had trouble, though having opportunities of knowing it well,
in discriminating from some other species. Supposing that
you were inclined to be so very kind as to do this, and could
(which I do not expect) spare the time, as I have said, a
mere cross to each such species in any useless proof-sheets
would give me the information desired, which, I may add,
I know must be vague.

remember how many years you would allow that Charlock
seed might live in the ground. Next time you write, show

XIn the Autobiographical chapter (Vol. I. p. 84) my father
wrote:  Early in 1856 Lyell advised me to write out my
views pretty fully, and I began at once to do so on a scale
three or four times as extensive as that which was afterwards
followed in my  Origin of Species ;  yet it was only an
abstract of the materials which I had collected. The letters
in the present chapter are chiefly concerned with the prepara-
tion of this unfinished book.
The work was begun on May 14th, and steadily continued
up to June 1858, when it was interrupted by the arrival of
Mr. Wallaces MS. During the two years which we are now
considering, he wrote ten chapters (that is about one-halQ of
the projected book. He remained for the most part at home,

anything it must be a ve>y thin and little volume, giving a
sketch of my views and difficulties ; but it is really dreadfully
unphilosophical to give a rhumi, without exact references, of
an unpublished work. But Lyell seemed to think I might
do this, at the suggestion of friends, and on the ground, which
I might state, that I had been at work for eighteen  years, and
yet could not publish for several years, and especially as I
could point out difficulties which seemed to me to require
especial investigation. Now what think you ? I should be
really grateful for advice. I thought of giving up a couple of
months and writing such a sketch, and trying to keep my
judgment open whether or no to publish it when completed.
It will be simply impossible for me to give exact references ;
anything important I should state on the authority of the
author generally ; and instead of giving all the facts on
which I ground my opinion, I could give by memory only
one or two. In the Preface I would state that the work
could not be considered strictly scientific, but a mere sketch
or outline of a future work in which full references, &a,
should be given. Eheu, eheu, 1 believe I should sneer at
any one else doing this, and my only comfort is, that I

Lyell seemed rather to doubt on this head)* ; but I cannot bear
the idea of begging some Editor and Council to publish, and
then perhaps to have to apologise humbly for having led them

according to a very wise saying of my fathers, is the only
fit state for asking advice, viz. with my mind firmly made up,,
and then, as my father used to say, good advice was very
comfortable, and it was easy to reject bad advice. But

should give up anything false published in the preliminary

mischief by spreading error, which as I have often heard you
say is much easier spread than corrected. I confess I lean
more and more to at least making the attempt and drawing
up a sketch and trying to keep my judgment, whether to
publish, open. But I always return to my fixed idea that it
is dreadfully unphilosophical to publish without full details.
I certainly think my future work in full would profit by
hearing what my friends or critics (if reviewed) thought of
the outline.

... I have been very deeply interested by Wollastons book
though I iixSct greatly from many of his doctrines. Did you
ever read anything so rich, considering how very far he goes,
as his denunciations against those who go further :  most
mischievous, absurd, unsound. Theology is at the
bottom of some of this. I told him he was like Calvin
burning a heretic. It is a very valuable and clever book in
my opinion. He has evidently read very little out of his own
line. I urged him to read the New Zealand essay. His
Geology also is rather eocene, as I told him. In fact I wrote
most frankly ; I fear too frankly ; he says he is sure that
ultra-honesty is my characteristic : I do not know whether
he meant it as a sneer ; I hope not Talking of eocene geology,
I got so wroth about the Atlantic continent, more especially
from a note from Woodward (who has published a capital
book on shells), who does not seem to doubt that every island
in the Pacific and Atlantic arc the remains of continents, sub-
merged within period of existing species, that I fairly ex-
ploded, and wrote to Lyell to protest, and summed up all the
continents created of late years by Forbes (the head sinner !)

humble, and allow you all to make continents, as easily as a
cook does pancakes.
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to C. Lyell.
Down, June 25th [1856].
My dear Lyell,  I will have the following tremendous
letter copied to make the reading easier, and as I want ta
keep a copy.
As you say you would like to hear my reasons for being
most unwilling to believe in the continental extensions of late
authors, I gladly write them, as, without 1 am convinced of
my error, I shall have to give them condensed in my essay,
when I discuss single and multiple creation ; I shall therefore
be particularly glad to have your general opinion on them,
I may quite likely have persuaded myself in my wrath that
there is more in them than there is. If there was much more
reason to admit a continental extension in any one or two
instances (as in Madeira) than in other cases, I should feel no-
difficulty whatever. But if on account of European plants,
and littoral sea shells, it is thought necessary to join Madeira
to the mainland. Hooker is quite right to join New Holland
to New Zealand, and Auckland Island (and Raoul Island to
N.E.), and these to S. America and the Falklands, and these
to CTTXTHR Tristan dAcunha, and these to Kerguelen Land ; thus
making, either strictly at the same time, or at different periods,
but all within the life of recent beings, an almost circumpolar
belt of land. So again Galapagos and Juan Fernandez must
be joined to America ; and if we trust to littoral sea shells, the
Galapagos must have been joined to the Pacific Islands (2400
miles distant) as well as to America, and as Woodward seems
to think all the islands in the Pacific into a magnificent con-
tinent ; also the islands in the Southern Indian Ocean into
another continent, with Madagascar and Africa, and perhaps.
India. In the North Atlantic, Europe will stretch half-way

across the ocean to the Azores, and further north right across.
In short, we must suppose probably, half the present ocean
was land within the period of living organisms. The Globe
within this period must have had a quite different aspect.
Now the only way to test this, that I can see, is to consider
whether the continents have undergone within this same pe-
riod such wonderful permutations. In all North and South
and Central America, we have both recent and miocene (or
eocene) shells, quite distinct on the opposite sides, and hence
I cannot doubt that fundamentally America has held its place
since at least, the miocene period. In Africa almost all the
living shells are distinct on the opposite sides of the inter-
tropical regions, short as the distance is compared to the range
of marine mollusca, in uninterrupted seas ; hence I infer that
Africa has e.xisted since our present species were created.
Even the isthmus of Suez and the Aralo-Caspian basin have
had a great antiquity. So I imagine, from the tertiary depos-
its, has India. In Australia the great fauna of extinct mar-
supials shows that before the present mammals appeared,
Australia was a separate continent. I do not for one second
doubt that very large portions of all these continents have
undergone great changes of level within this period, but yet I
conclude that fundamentally they stood as barriers in the sea,
where they now stand ; and therefore I should require the
weightiest evidence to make me believe in such immense
changes within the period of living organisms in our oceans,
where, moreover, from the great depths, the changes must
have been vaster in a vertical sense.
Secondly. Submerge our present continents, leaving a few
mountain peaks as islands, and what will the character of the
islands be ?  Consider that the Pyrenees, Sierra Nevada,
Apennines, Alps, Carpathians, are non-volcanic, Etna and
Caucasus, volcanic. In Asia, Altai and Himalaya, I believe
non-volcanic. In North Africa the non-volcanic, as 1 imagine,
Alps of Abyssinia and of the Atlas. In South Africa, the

Snow Mountains. In Australia, the non- volcanic Alps. In
North America, the White Mountains, Alleghanies and Rocky
Mountains  some of the latter alone, I believe, volcanic. In
South America to the east, the non-volcanic [Silla] of Caracas,
and Itacolumi of Brazil, further south the Sierra jVentanas,
and in the Cordilleras, many volcanic but not all. Now
compare these peaks with the oceanic islands ; as far as
known all are volcanic, except St Pauls (a strange bedevilled
rock), and the Seychelles, if this latter can be called oceanic,
in the line of Madagascar ; the Falklands, only 500 miles off,
are only a shallow bank ; New Caledonia, hardly oceanic, is
another exception. This argument has to me great weight
Compare on a Geographical Map, islands which, we have
several reasons to suppose, were connected with mainland, as
Sardinia, and how different it appears. Believing, as I am
inclined, that continents as continents, and oceans as oceans,
are. of immense antiquity  I should say that if any of the
existing oceanic islands have any relation of any kind to
continents, they are forming continents ; and that by the
time they could form a continent, the volcanoes would be
denuded to their cores, leaving peaks of syenite, diorite, or
porphyry. But have we nowhere any last wreck of a con-
tinent, in the midst of the ocean ? St. Pauls Rock, and such
old battered volcanic islands, as St. Helena, may be ; but
I think we can see some reason why we should have less
evidence of sinking than of rising continents (if my view in
my Coral volume has any truth in it, viz. : that volcanic
outbursts accompany rising areas), for during subsidence
there will be no compensating agent at work, in rising areas
there will be the additional clement of outpoured volcanic
Thirdly. Considering the depth of the ocean, I was, before I
got your letter, inclined vehemently to dispute the vast
amount of subsidence, but I must strike my colours. With
respect to coral reefs, I carefully guarded against its being

supposed that a continent was indicated by the groups of
atolls. It is difficult to guess, as it seems to me, the
amount of subsidence indicated by coral reefs ; but in such
large areas as the Lowe Archipelago, the Marshall Archi-
pelago, and Laccadive group, it would, judging from the
heights of existing oceanic archipelagoes, be odd, if some
peaks of from 8000 to 10,000 feet had not been buried. Even
after your letter a suspicion crossed me whether it would bo
fair to argue from subsidences in the middle of the greatest
oceans to continents ; but refreshing my memory by talking
with Ramsay in regard to the probable thickness in one vertical
line of the Silurian and carboniferous formation, it seems there
must have been at least 10,000 feet of subsidence during these
formations in Europe and North America, and therefore
during the continuance of nearly the same set of organic
beings. But even 1 2,000 feet would not be enough for the
Azores, or for Hookers continent ; I believe Hooker does not
infer a continuous continent, but approximate groups of
islands, with, if we may judge from existing continents, not
profoundly deep sea between them ; but the argument from
the volcanic nature of nearly every existing oceanic island
tells against such supposed groups of islands,  for I presume
he does not suppose a mere chain of volcanic islands belting
the southern hemisphere.
Fourthly. The supposed continental extensions do not seem
to me, perfectly to account for all the phenomena of distri-
bution on islands ; as the absence of mammals and Batra-
chians ; the absence of certain great groups of insects on
Madeira, and of Acacim and Banksias, &c., in New Zealand ;
the paucity of plants in some cases, &c. Not that those who
believe in various accidental means of dispersal, can explain
most of these cases ; but they may at least say that these
facts seem hardly compatible with former continuous land.
Finally. For these several reasons, and especially con-
sidering it certain (in which you will agree) that we arc ex-

tremely ignorant of means of dispersal, I cannot avoid think-
ing that Forbes  Atlantis  was an ill-service to science, as
checking a close study of means of dissemination. I shall be
really grateful to hear, as briefly as you like, whether these
ailments have any weight with you, putting yourself in the
position of an honest judge. I told Hooker I was going to
write to you on this subject ; and I should like him to read
this ; but whether he or you will think it worth time and
postage remains to be proved.

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to Asa Gray.
Down, July 20th [iSj6].
... It is not a little egotistical, but I should like to tell
you (and I do not think I have) how I view my work.
Nineteen years (!) ago it occurred to me that whilst otherwise
employed on Nat. Hist., I might perhaps do good if I noted
any sort of facts bearing on the question of the origin of
species, and this I have since been doing. Either species
have been independently created, or they have descended
from other species, like varieties from one species. I think it
can be shown to be probable that man gets his most distinct
varieties by preserving such as arise best worth keeping and
destroying the others, but I should fill a quire if I were to go
on. To be brief, I assume that species arise like our domestic
varieties with much extinction ; and then test this hypothesis
by comparison with as many general and pretty well-esta-
blished propositions as I can find made out,  in geographical
1856.] GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION. 79
distribution, geological history, affinities, &c. &c. And it
seems to me that, supposing that such hypothesis were to
explain such general propositions, we ought, in accordance
with the common way of following all sciences, to admit it till
some better hypothesis be found out. For to my mind to
say that species were created so and so is no scientific explan-
ation, only a reverent way of saying it is so and so. But it
is nonsensical trying to show how I try to proceed, in the
compass of a note. But as an honest man, I must tell you that
I have come to the heterodox conclusion, that there are no
such things as independently created species  that species are
only strongly defined varieties. I know that this will make
you despise me. I do not much underrate the many huge
difficulties on this view, but yet it seems to me to explain too
much, otherwise inexplicable, to be false. Just to allude to
one point in your last note, viz. about species of the same
genus getierally having a common or continuous area ; if they
are actual lineal descendants of one species, this of course
would be the case ; and the sadly too many exceptions (for
me) have to be explained by climatal and geological changes.
A fortiori on this view (but on exactly same grounds), all the
individuals of the same species should have a continuous
distribution. On this latter branch of the subject I have put
a chapter together, and Hooker kindly read it over. I
thought the exceptions and difficulties were so great that on
the whole the balance weighed against my notions, but I was
much pleased to find that it seemed to have considerable
weight with Hooker, who said he had never been so much
staggered about the permanence of species.
I must say one word more in justification (for I feel sure
that your tendency will be to despise me and my crotchets),
that all my notions about how species change are derived
from long-continued study of the works of (and converse
with) agriculturists and horticulturists ; and I believe I
see my way pretty clearly on the means used by nature to

'My DEAR Hooker,  Your letter is of much value to me.
I was not able to get a definite answer from Lyell,* as you will
see in the enclosed letters, though I inferred that he thought
nothing of my arguments. Had it not been for this corre-
spondence, I should have written sadly too strongly. You
may rely on it I shall put my doubts moderately. There
never was such a predicament as mine : here you continental
e.xtenslonists would remove enormous difficulties opposed to
me, and yet I cannot honestly admit the doctrine, and must
therefore say so. I cannot get over the fact that not a frag-
ment of secondary or palaeozoic rock has been found on any
island above 500 or 600 miles from a mainland. You rather
misunderstand me when you think I doubt the possibility of
subsidence of 20,000 or 30,000 feet ; it is only probability, con-
sidering such evidence as we have independently of distribution.
I have not yet worked out in full detail the distribution of
mammalia, both identical and allied, with respect to the one
element of depth of the sea ; but as far as I have gone, the
results are to me surprisingly accordant with my very most
troublesome belief in not such great geographical changes as
you believe ; and in mammalia we certainly know more of
means of distribution than in any other class. Nothing is so
ve.xatious to me, as so constantly finding myself drawing
different conclusions from better judges than myself, from
the same facts.
I fancy I have lately removed many (not geographical)
great difficulties opposed to my notions, but God knows it
may be all hallucination.

Please return Lyells letters.
What a capital letter of Lyells that to you is, and what a
wonderful man he is. I differ from him greatly in thinking
that those who believe that species are not fixed will multiply
specific names : I know in my own case my most frequent
source of doubt was whether others would not think this or
that was a God-created Barnacle, and surely deserved a
name. Othenvise I should only have thought whether the
amount of difference and permanence was sufficient to justify
a name : I am, also, surprised at his thinking it immaterial
whether species are absolute or not : whenever it is proved
that all species are produced by generation, by laws of change,
what good evidence we shall have of the gaps in formations.
And what a science Natural History will be, when we are in
our graves, when all the laws of change are thought one of
the most important parts of Natural History.
I cannot conceive why Lyell thinks such notions as mine
or of  Vestiges, will invalidate specific centres. But I must
not run on and take up your time. My MS. will not, I fear,

half-dozen cases, I should not feel the least difficulty ; but
the generality of the facts of all islands (except one or two)
having a considerable part of their productions in common
with one or more mainlands utterly staggers me. What a
wonderful case of the Epacridae 1 It is most vexatious, also-
humiliating, to me that I cannot follow and subscribe to the
way in which you strikingly put your view of the case.
I look at your facts (about Eucalyptus, &c.) as damning
against continental extension, and if you like also damning
against migration, or at least of enormous difficulty. I see
the ground of our difference (in a letter I must put myself
on an equality in arguing) lies, in my opinion, that scarcely
anything is known of means of distribution. I quite agree
with A. De Candolles (and I dare say your) opinion that it
is poor work putting together the merely possible means of
distribution ; but I see no other way in which the subject can
be attacked, for I think that A. De Candolles argument,
that no plants have been introduced into England except by
mans agency, of no weight. I cannot but think that the
theory of continental extension does do some little harm
as stopping investigation of the means of dispersal, which,
whether negative or positive, seems to me of value ; when
negatived, then every one who believes in single centres will
have to admit continental extensions.
... I see from your remarks that you do not understand
my notions (whether or no worth anything) about modifica-
tion ; I attribute very little to the direct action of climate, &c.
I suppose, in regard to specific centres, we are at cross
purposes ; I should call the kitchen garden in which the red
cabbage was produced, or the farm in which Bakewell made
the Shorthorn cattle, the specific centre of these species I

best to make it less wretched. Sometimes I am in very good

heavens, how little that is worth ! . . ,
[With regard to  specific centres, a passage from a letter
dated CTTXTHR July 25, 1856, from Sir Charles Lyell to Sir J. D. Hooker
( Life, vol. ii. p. 216) is of interest :
 I fear much that if Darwin argues that species are
phantoms, he will also have to admit that single centres of
dispersion are phantoms also, and that would deprive me
of much of the value which I ascribe to the present provinces
of animals and plants, as illustrating modem and tertiary
changes in physical geography.
He seems to have recognised, however, that the phantom
doctrine would soon have to be faced, for he wrote in the
same letter :  Whether Darwin persuades you and me to
renounce our faith in species (when geological epochs arc
considered) or not, I foresee that many will go over to the
indefinite modifiability doctrine.
In the autumn my father was still working at geogp-aphical
distribution, and again sought aid from Sir J. D. Hooker.
 In the course of some weeks, you unfortunate wretch, you
will have my MS. on one point of Geographical Distribution.
I will, however, never ask such a favour again ; but in regard
to this one piece of MS., it is of infinite importance to me for
you to see it ; for never in my life have I felt such difficulty
what to do, and I heartily wish I could slur the whole subject

intend to stop to perfect any line of investigation beyond
current work. Thus far and no farther I shall follow Lyells
urgent advice. Your remarks weighed with me considerably.
I find to my sorrow it will run to quite a big book. I have
found my careful work at pigeons really invaluable, as en-

gradual changes in the breeds of pigeons has been extra-

of some few difficulties, and the difficulties seemed to me
pretty fairly stated, but I had become so bewildered with
conflicting facts, evidence, reasoning and opinions, that I felt

NATURAL SELECTION.

separate question, but the conclusion which I have come to,
quite independently of geographical distribution, is that
e.xtemal conditions (to which naturalists so often appeal) do
by themselves very little. How much they do is the point of
all others on which I feel myself very weak. I judge from
the facts of variation under domestication, and I may yet get
more light. But at present, after drawing up a rough copy
on this subject, my conclusion is that external conditions do
extremely little, except in causing mere variability. This
mere variability (causing the child not closely to resemble its
parent) I look at as very different from the formation of a
marked variety or new species. (No doubt the variability is
governed by laws, some of which I am endeavouring very
obscurely to trace.) The formation of a strong variety or
species I look at as almost wholly due to the selection of
what may be incorrectly called variations or variability.
This power of selection stands in the most direct relation to
time, and in the state of nature can be only excessively slow.
Again, the slight differences selected, by which a race or
species is at last formed, stands, as I think can be shown
.(even with plants, and obviously with animals), in a far more
important relation to its associates than to external conditions.
Therefore, according to my principles, whether right or wrong,
I cannot agree with your proposition that time, and altered
conditions, and altered associates, are  convertible terms." I
look at the first and the last as far more important; time
being important only so far as giving scope to selection.
Cod knows whether you will perceive at what I am driving.
I shall have to discuss and think more about your difficulty of
the temperate and sub-arctic forms in the S. hemisphere than
I have yet done. But I am inclined to think that I am right
(if my general principles are right), that there would be little
tendency to the formation of a new species, during the period
of migration, whether shorter or longer, though considerable
variability may have supervened. . . .

with. I have just been comparing definitions of species, and
stating briefly how systematic naturalists work out their
subjects. Aquilegia in the Flora Indica was a capital
example for me. It is really laughable to see what different
ideas are prominent in various naturalists minds, when they
speak of "species in some, resemblance is everything and
descent of little weight in some, resemblance seems to go for
nothing, and Creation the reigning idea  in some, descent is
the key,  in some, sterility an unfailing test, with others it is
not worth a farthing. It all comes, I believe, from trying to
define the undefinable. I suppose you have lost the odd

the results I have worked out in several ways. It is of great
importance to my notions. By the way you have paid me a
great compliment : * to be simply mentioned even in such a
paper I consider a very great honour. One of your con-
clusions makes me groan, viz. that the line of connection of
the strictly Alpine plants is through Greenland. I should
extremely like to see your reasons published in detail, for it
riles me (this is a proper expression, is it not?) dreadfully.
Lyell told me, that Agassiz having a theory about when
Saurians were first created, on hearing some careful observa-
tions opposed to this, said he did not believe it, " for Nature
never lied. I am just in this predicament, and repeat to
you that,  Nature never lies, ergo, theorisers arc always
right . . .
Overworked as you are, I dare say you will say that I am
an odious plague ; but here is another suggestion 1 I was led
by one of my wild speculations to conclude (though it has
nothing to do with geographical distribution, yet it has with
your statistics) that trees would have a strong tendency to have
flowers with dioecious, moncecious or polygamous structure.
Seeing that this seemed so in Persoon, I took one little
British I'lora, and discriminating trees from bushes according
to Loudon, I have found that the result was in species, genera
and families, as I anticipated. So I sent my notions to Hooker
to ask him to tabulate the New Zealand Flora for this end,
and he thought my result sufficiently curious, to do so ; and
the accordance with Britain is very striking, and the more so,
as he made three classes of trees, bushes, and herbaceous
plants. (He says further he shall work the Tasmanian Flora
on the same principle.) The bushes hold an intermediate
position between the other two classes. It seems to me a

Down, April I2th [1857].
Mv DEAR Hooker,  ^Your letter has pleased me much,
for I never can get it out of my head, that I take unfair
advantage of your kindness, as I receive all and give nothing.
What a splendid discussion you could write on the whole
subject of variation 1 The cases discussed in your last note
are valuable to me (though odious and damnable), as showing
how profoundly ignorant we are on the causes of variation.
I shall just allude to these cases, as a sort of sub-division
of polymorphism a little more definite, I fancy, than the
variation of, for instance, the Rubi, and equally or more
perplexing.
I have just been putting my notes together on variations
.apparently due to the immediate and direct action of external
causes ; and I have been struck with one result The most
firm sticklers for independent creation admit, that the fur of
the same species is thinner towards the south of the range of
the same species than to the north  that the same shells are
brighter-coloured to the south than north ; that the same
[shell] is paler-coloured in deep water  that insects are
smaller and darker on mountains  more livid and testaceous
near the sea  that plants are smaller and more hairy and with
brighter flowers on mountains: now in all such, and other
cases, distinct species in the two zones follow the same rule,
which seems to me to be most simply explained by species,
being only strongly marked varieties, and therefore following

the same laws as recognised and admitted varieties. I mention
all this on account of the variation of plants in ascending
mountains ; I have quoted the foregoing remark only generally
with no examples, for I add, there is so much doubt and dispute
Avhat to call varieties ; but yet I have stumbled on so many
casual remarks on varieties of plants on mountains being so
characterised, that I presume there is some truth in it. What
think you ? Do you believe there is any tendency in varieties,
as generally so called, of plants to become more hairy, and
with proportionally larger and brighter-coloured flowers in
ascending a mountain ?
I have been interested in my " weed garden, of 3 x 2 feet
square: I mark each seedling as it appears, and I am
.astonished at the number that come up, and still more at
the number killed by slugs, &c. Already 59 have been so
killed ; I expected a good many, but I had fancied that this
was a less potent check than it seems to be, and I attributed
almost exclusively to mere choking, the destruction of the
seedlings. Grass-seedlings seem to suffer much less than
exogens. . . ,

alluded to a score of times. Falconer was haranguing on
it the other day to me. Meyen or Gay, or some such fellow
(whom you would despise), I remember, makes some remark
on Chilian Cordillera plants. Wimmer has written a little book
on the same lines, and on varieties being so characterized in
the Alps. But after writing to you, I confess I was staggered
by finding one man (Moquin-Tandon, I think) saying that
Alpine flowers are strongly inclined to be white, and Linmus
saying that cold makes plants apetalous, even the same
species ! Are Arctic plants often apetalous ? My general
belief from my compiling work is quite to agree with what
you say about the little direct influence of climate ; and I
have just alluded to the hairiness of Alpine plants as an ex-
ception. The odoriferousness would be a good case for me if
I knew of varieties being more odoriferous in dry habitats.
I fear that I have looked at the hairiness of Alpine plants as
so generally acknowledged that I have not marked passages,
so as at all to see what kind of evidence authors advance.
I must confess, the other day, when I asked Falconer, whether
he knew of individual plants losing or acquiring hairiness
when transported, he did not. But now this second, my
memory flashes on me, and I am certain I have somewhere
got marked a case of hairy plants from the Pyrenees losing
hairs when cultivated at Montpellier. Shall you think me
very impudent if I tell you that I have sometimes thought
that (quite independently of the present case), you are a little
too hard on bad observers ; that a remark made by a bad
observer cannot be right ; an observer who deserves to be
damned, you would utterly damn. I feel entire deference
to any remark you make out of your own head ; but when in
opposition to some poor devil, I somehow involuntarily feel
not quite so much, but yet much deference for your opinion.
I do not know in tlie least whether there is any truth in this
my criticism against you, but I have often thought I would
tell you it.

laborious undertaking, sympathy is a valuable and real en-

that we have thought much alike and to a certain extent have
come to similar conclusions. In regard to the Paper in the

very rare to find oneself agreeing pretty closely with any
theoretical paper ; for it is lamentable how each man draws
his own different conclusions from the very same facts. This

though I have written many chapters, I do not suppose I
shall go to press for two years. I have never heard how long
you intend staying in the Malay Archipelago ; I wish I might
profit by the publication of your Travels there before my
work appears, for no doubt you will reap a large harvest of
facts. I have acted already in accordance with your advice
of keeping domestic varieties, and those appearing in a state
of nature, distinct ; but I have sometimes doubted of the.
wisdom of this, and therefore I am glad to be backed by your
opinion. I must confess, however, I rather doubt the truth

of the now very prevalent doctrine of all our domestic animals
having descended from several wild stocks ; though I do not
doubt that it is so in some cases. I think there is rather
better evidence on the sterility of hybrid animals than you
seem to admit : and in regard to plants the collection of
carefully recorded facts by Kolreuter and Gaertner (and
Herbert) is enormous. I most entirely agree with you on the
little effects of  climatal conditions, which one sees referred
to ad nauseam in all books ; I suppose some very little effect
must be attributed to such influences, but I fully believe that
they are very slight It is really impossible to explain my
views (in the compass of a letter), on the causes and means of
variation in a state of nature ; but I have slowly adopted a

its author, seems, alas, not to be the slightest guarantee of
truth 1 . . .

any part or organ developed normally, {Le. not a mon-

pared with the same part or organ in allied species, tends
to be highly variable. I cannot doubt this from my mass
of collected facts. To give an instance, the Cross-bill is very
abnormal in the structure of its bill compared with other
allied Fringillidae, and the beak is eminently variable. The
Himantopus, remarkable from the wonderful length of its legs,
is very variable in the length of its legs. I could give many

If Nepenthes consisted of one or two species in a group with

so give them the appearance of being more hairy. He quotes-

of measuring slight variations. Indeed, after writing, this
occurred to me ; for I have Cruciatuila stylosa coming into-

thinking of this I at once felt how could one judge whether it
was variable in any high degree. How different, for instance,
from the beak of a bird ! But I am not satisfied with this ex-
planation, and am staggered. Yet I think there is something

in the law ; I have had so many instances, as the following :
I wrote to Wollaston to ask him to run through the Madeira
Beetles and tell me whether any one presented anything very
anomalous in relation to its allies. He gave me a unique case
of an enormous head in a female, and then I found in his book,
already stated, that the size of the head was astonishingly
variable. Part of the difference with plants may be accounted
for by many of my cases being secondary male or female
characters but then I have striking cases with hermaphrodite
Cirripedes. The cases seem to mo far too numerous for
accidental coincidences of great variability and abnormal de-
velopment I presume that you will not object to my put-
ting a note saying that you had reflected over the case, and
though one or two cases seemed to support, quite as many
or more seemed wholly contradictory. This want of evidence is
the more surprising to me, as generally I find any proposition
more easily tested by observations in botanical works, which
I have picked up, than in zoological works. I never dreamed
that you had kept the subject at all before your mind. Alto-
gether the case is one more of my many horrid puzzles. My
obseivations, though on so infinitely a small scale, on the
struggle for existence, begin to make me see a little clearer
how the fight goes on. Out of sixteen kinds of seed sown on
my meadow, fifteen have germinated, but now they are
perishing at such a rate that I doubt whether more than one
will flower. Here we have choking which has taken place
likewise on a great scale, with plants not seedlings, in a bit of
my lawn allowed to grow up. On the other hand, in a bit of
ground, 2 by 3 feet, I have daily marked each seedling weed
as it has appeared during March, April and May, and 357 have
come up, and of these 277 have already been killed, chiefly by
slugs. By the way, at Moor Park, I saw rather a pretty case
of the effects of animals on vegetation : there are enormous
commons with clumps of old Scotch firs on the hills, and
about eight or ten years ago some of these commons were

enclosed, and all round the clumps nice young trees are
springing up by the million, looking exactly as if planted, so
many are of the same age. In other parts of the common, not
yet enclosed, I looked for miles and not one young tree could
be seen. I then went near (within quarter of a mile of the
clumps) and looked closely in the heather, and there I found
tens of thousands of young Scotch firs (thirty in one square
yard) with their tops nibbled off by the few cattle which
occasionally roam over these wretched heaths. One little tree,
three inches high, by the rings appeared to be twenty-six years
old, with a short stem about as thick as a stick of sealing-wax.
What a wondrous problem it is, what a play of forces, determi-
ning the kind and proportion of each plant in a square yard
of turf ! It is to my mind truly wonderful. And yet we are
pleased to wonder when some animal or plant becomes
extinct

My dear Hooker,  I honour your conscientious care
about the medals.* Thank God I I am only an amateur (but
a much interested one) on the subject.
It is an old notion of mine that more good is done by giving
medals to younger men in the early part of their career, than as
a mere reward to men whose scientific career is nearly finished.
Whether medals ever do any good is a question which does

not concern us, as there the medals are. I am almost inclined
to think that I would rather lower the standard, and give
medals to young workers than to old ones with no especial
claims. With regard to especial claims, I think it just
deserving your attention, that if general claims are once
admitted, it opens the door to great laxity in giving them.
Think of the case of a very rich man, who aided solely with
his money, but to a grand extent  or such an inconceivable
prodigy as a minister of the Crown who really cared for
science. Would you give such men medals? Perhaps
medals could not be better applied than exclusively to such
men. I confess at present I incline to stick to especial claims
which can be put down on paper. . . .
I am much confounded by your showing that there are not
obvious instances of my (or rather Waterhouses) law of
abnormal developments being highly variable. I have been
thinking more of your remark about the difficulty of judging
or comparing variability in plants from the great general
variability of parts. I should look at the law as more com-
pletely smashed if you would turn in your mind for a little
while for cases of great variability of an organ, and tell me
whether it is moderately easy to pick out such cases ; for if
they can be picked out, and, notwithstanding, do not coincide
with great or abnormal development, it would be a complete
smasher. It is only beginning in your mind at the variability
end of the question instead of at the abnormality end. Per-
haps cases in which a part is highly variable in all the species
of a group should be excluded, as possibly being something
distinct, and connected with the perplexing subject of poly-
morphism. Will you perfect your assistance by further
considering, for a little, the subject this way ?
I have been so much interested this morning in comparing
all my notes on the variation of the several species of the genus

There are 339 species in genera of 4 and upwards, and 323 in

varieties. The 323 species have only 37. Proportionately
(339 : 323 :: 51 : 48'5) they ought to have had 484 species

gone) seems to me one of the most important arguments I
have yet met with, that varieties are only small species  or
species only strongly marked varieties. The subject is in
many ways so very important for me ; I wish much you would
think of any well-worked Floras with from 1000-2000 species,
with the varieties marked. It is good to have hair-splitters

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to Asa Gray.
Down, Feb. list [1859].
My dear Gray,  My last letter begged no favour, this
one does : but it will really cost you very little trouble to
answer me, and it will be of very great service to me,
owing to a remark made to me by Hooker, which I cannot
credit, and which was suggested to him by one of my letters.
He suggested my asking you, and I told him I would not
give the least hint what he thought. I generally believe
Hooker implicitly, but he is sometimes, I think, and he
confesses it, rather over-critical, and his ingenuity in discover-
ing flaws seems to me admirable. Here is my question :
 Do you think that good botanists in drawing up a local
Flora, whether small or large, or in making a Prodromus like
Do Candolles, would almost universally, but unintentionally
and unconsciously, tend to record {i.e. marking with Greek
letters and giving short characters) varieties in the large or
in the small genera ? Or would the tendency be to record the
varieties about equally in genera of all sizes ? Are you your-
self conscious on reflection that you have attended to, and
recorded more carefully the varieties in large or small, or very
small genera ?
I know what fleeting and trifling things varieties very often
are ; but my query applies to such as have been thought
worth marking and recording. If you could screw time to
send me ever so brief an answer to this, pretty soon, it would
be a great service to me.
Yours most truly obliged,
C. Darwin.

botanists to record such in large or small genera.

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to A. R. Wallace.
Down, Dec. 22nd, 1857.
My dear Sir,  I thank you for your letter of Sept 27th.
I am extremely glad to hear that you are attending to distri-
bution in accordance with theoretical ideas. I am a firm
believer that without speculation there is no good and original
observation. Few travellers have attended to such points as
you are now at work on ; and, indeed, the whole subject of ,
distribution of animals is dreadfully behind that of plants.
You say that you have been somewhat surprised at no notice
having been taken of your paper in the Annals.* I cannot say
that I am, for so very few naturalists care for anything beyond
the mere description of species. But you must not suppose
that your paper has not been attended to : two very good
men. Sir C. Lyell, and Mr. E. Blyth at Calcutta, specially
called my attention to it Though agreeing with you on your
conclusions in that paper, I believe I go much further than
you ; but it is too long a subject to enter on my speculative
notions. I have not yet seen your paper on the distribution
of animals in the Aru Islands. I shall read it with the
utmost interest ; for I think that the most interesting quarter
of the whole globe in respect to distribution, and I have long
been very imperfectly trying to collect data for the Malay
Archipelago. I shall be quite prepared to subscribe to your

doctrine of subsidence ; indeed, from the quite independent
evidence of the Coral Reefs I coloured my original map (in my
Coral volume) of the Aru Islands as one of subsidence, but
got frightened and left it uncoloured. But I can see that you
are inclined to go much further than I am in regard to the
former connection of oceanic islands with continents. Ever
since poor E. Forbes propounded this doctrine, it has been
eagerly followed ; and Hooker elaborately discusses the
former connection of all the Antarctic Islands and New Zea-
land and South America. About a year ago I discussed this
subject much with Lyell and Hooker (for I shall have to treat
of it), and wrote out my arguments in opposition ; but you
will be glad to hear that neither Lyell nor Hooker thought
much of my arguments. Nevertheless, for once in my life,
I dare withstand the almost preternatural sagacity of Lyell.
You ask about land-shells on islands far distant from con-
tinents : Madeira has a few identical with those of Europe,
and here the evidence is really good, as some of them are sub-
fossil. In the Pacific Islands there are cases of identity, which
I cannot at present persuade myself to account for by intro-
duction through mans agency ; although Dr. Aug. Gould has
conclusively shown that many land-shells have thus been
distributed over the Pacific by mans agency. These cases of
introduction are most plaguing. Have you not found it so in
the Malay Archipelago? It has seemed to me in the lists of
mammals of Timor and other islands, that several in all pro-
bability have been naturalised. . . .
You ask whether I shall discuss man. I think I shall
avoid the whole subject, as so surrounded with prejudices ;
though I fully admit that it is the highest and most interesting
problem for the naturalist. My work, on which I have now
been at work more or less for twenty years, will not fix or
settle anything ; but I hope it will aid by giving a large col-
lection of facts, with one definite end. I get on very slowly,
partly from ill-health, partly from being a very slow worker.

My dear Fox,  I want you to observe one point for me,
on which I am extremely much interested, and which will give
you no trouble beyond keeping your eyes open, and that is a
habit I know full well that you have.
I find horses of various colours often have a spinal band or
stripe of different and darker tint than the rest of the body ;
rarely transverse bars on the legs, generally on the under-side
of the front legs, still more rarely a very faint transverse
shoulder-stripe like an ass.
Is there any breed of Delamere forest ponies? I have
found out little about ponies in these respects. Sir P. Egerton
has, I believe, some quite thoroughbred chestnut horses ; have
any of them the spinal stripe? Mouse-coloured ponies, or
rather small horses, often have spinal and leg bars. So have
dun horses (by dun I mean real colour of cream mixed with
brown, bay, or chestnut). So have sometimes chestnuts, but I
have not yet got a case of spinal stripe in chestnut, race horse,
or in quite heavy cart-horse. Any fact of this nature of such
stripes in horses would be most useful to me. There is a

splendid. It is a grand case of floating ice versus glaciers.
He ought to have compared the northern and southern shores
of the islands. It is eminently interesting to me, for I have
written a very long chapter on the subject, collecting briefly
all the geological evidence of glacial action in different parts
of the world, and then at great length (on the theory of species
changing) I have discussed the migration and modification of
plants and animals, in sea and land, over a large part of the
world. To my mind, it throws a flood of light on the whole
subject of distribution, if combined with the modification of
species. Indeed, I venture to speak with some little con-
fidence on this, for Hooker, about a year ago, kindly read
over my chapter, and though he then demurred gravely to
the general conclusion, I was delighted to hear a week or two
ago that he was inclined to come round pretty strongly to my
views of distribution and change during the glacial period. I
had a letter from Thompson, of Calcutta, the other day, which
helps me much, as he is making out for me what heat our
temperate plants can endure. But it is too long a subject for
a note ; and I have written thus only because Hartungs note
has set the whole subject afloat in my mind again. But I
will write no more, for my object here is to think about

Mr. Wallaces Essay, referred to in the first letter, bore the
title,  On the Tendency of Varieties to depart indefinitely
from the Original Type, and was published in the Linnean
Societys Journal (1858, vol. iii. p. 53) as part of the joint
paper of  Messrs. C. Darwin and A. Wallace, of which the

and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural

So highly did Mr. Darwin appreciate the value of the

LETTERS.
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to C. Lyell.
Down, 18th [June 1858].
My DEAR Lyell,  Some year or so ago you recommended
me to read a paper by Wallace in the Annals, * which had
interested you, and, as I was writing to him, I knew this
would please him much, so I told him. He has to-day sent
me the enclosed, and asked me to forward it to you. It seems
to me well worth reading. Your words have come true with a
vengeance  that I should be forestalled. You said this, when
I explained to you here very briefly my views of  Natural
Selection  depending on the struggle for existence. I never
saw a more striking coincidence ; if Wallace had my MS.
sketch written out in 1842, he could not have made a better
short abstract I Even his terms now stand as heads of my
chapters. Please return me the MS., which he does not say
he wishes me to publish, but I shall, of course, at once write
and offer to send to any journal. So all my originality, what-
ever it may amount to, will be smashed, though my book,

if it will ever have any value, will not be deteriorated ; as all
the labour consists in the application of the theory,
I hope you will approve of Wallaces sketch, that I may
tell him what you say.
My dear Lyell, yours most truly,
C. Darwin.
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to C. Lyell.
Down, Friday [June 25, 1858].
My dear Lyell,  I am very sorry to trouble you, busy
as you are, in so merely personal an aHair ; but if you will
give me your deliberate opinion, you will do me as great a
service as ever man did, for I have entire confidence in your
judgment and honour. . . .
There is nothing in Wallaces sketch which is not written
out much fuller in my sketch, copied out in 1844, and leAd by
Hooker some dozen years ago. About a year ��^o I sent a
short sketch, of which I have a copy, of my views (owing to
correspondence on several points) to Asa Gray, so that I could
most truly say and prove that I take nothing from Wallace.
I should be extremely glad now to publish a sketch of my
general views in about a dozen pages or so ; but I cannot
persuade myself that I can do so honourably. Wallace says
nothing about publication, and I enclose his letter. But as I
had not intended to publish any sketch, can I do so honourably,
because Wallace has sent me an outline of his doctrine ? I
would far rather bum my whole book, than that he or any
other man should think that I had behaved in a paltry spirit
Do you not think his having sent me this sketch ties my
hands? .... If I could honourably publish, I would state
that I was induced now to publish a sketch (and I should be
very glad to be permitted to say, to follow your advice long
ago given) from Wallace having sent me an outline of my
general conclusions. We differ only, [in] that I was led to my

views from what artificial selection has done for domestic
animals. I would send Wallace a copy of my letter to Asa
Gray, to show him that I had not stolen his doctrine. But 1
cannot tell whether to publish now would not be base and
paltry. This was my first impression, and I should have
certainly acted on it had it not been for your letter.
This is a trumpery affair to trouble you with, but you
cannot tell how much obliged I should be for your advice.
By the way, would you object to send this and your answer
to Hooker to be fortvarded to me, for then I shall have the
opinion of my two best and kindest friends. This letter
is miserably written, and I write it now, that I may for
a time banish the whole subject ; and I am worn out with
musing . . .
My good dear friend, forgive me. This is a trumpery letter,,
influenced by trumpery feelings.
Yours most truly,
C. Darwin.
I will never trouble you or Hooker on the subject again.
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to C. Lyell.
Down, 26th [June 1858].
Mv DEAR Lyell,  Forgive me for adding a P.S. to make
the case as strong as possible against myself.
Wallace might say, You did not intend publishing an
abstract of your views till you received my communication.
Is it fair to take advantage of my having freely, though
unasked, communicated to you my ideas, and thus prevent
me forestalling you ?  The advantage which I should take
being that I am induced to publish from privately knowing
that Wallace is in the field. It seems hard on me that I
should be thus compelled to lose my priority of many years
standing, but I cannot feel at all sure that this alters the

justice of the case. First impressions are generally right, and
I at first thought it would be dishonourable in me now to
publish.
Yours most truly,
C. Darwin.
P.S.  I have always thought you would make a first-rate
Lord Chancellor ; and I now appeal to you as a Lord
Chancellor.

Down, Sept.* 5th [1857].
My dear Gray,  I forget the exact words which I used
in my former letter, but I dare say I said that I thought you
would utterly despise me when I told you what views I had
arrived at, which I did because I thought I was bound as an
honest man to do so. I should have been a strange mortal,
seeing how much I owe to your quite extraordinary kindness, if
in saying this I had meant to attribute the least fcad feeling to
you. Permit me to tell you that, before I had ever cor-
responded with you. Hooker had shown me several of your
letters (not of a private nature), and these gave me the
warmest feeling of respect to you ; and I should indeed be

ungrateful if your letters to me, and all I have heard of you,
had not strongly enhanced this feeling. But I did not feel in
the least sure that when you knew whither I was tending,
you might not think me so wild and foolish in my views (God
knows, arrived at slowly enough, and I hope conscientiously),
that you would think me worth no more notice or assistance.
To give one example : the last time I saw my dear old friend
Falconer, he attacked me most vigorously, but quite kindly,
and told me, You will do more harm than any ten Naturalists
will do good. I can see that you have already corrupted and
half-spoiled Hooker 1 !  Now when I see such strong feeling
in my oldest friends, you need not wonder that I always ex-
pect my views to be received with contempt But enough and
too much of thi.s.
I thank you most truly for the kind spirit of your last letter.
I agree to every word in it, and think I go as far as almost
any one in seeing the grave difficulties against my doctrine.
With respect to the extent to which I go, all the arguments
in favour of my notions fall rapidly away, the greater the scope
of forms considered. But in animals, embryology leads me to
an enormous and frightful range. The facts which kept me
longest scientifically orthodox are those of adaptation  the
pollen-masses in asclcpias  the mistletoe, with its pollen
carried by insects, and seed by birds  the woodpecker, with
its feet and tail, beak and tongue, to climb the tree and secure
insects. To talk of climate or Lamarckian habit producing
such adaptations to other organic beings is futile. This diffi-
culty I believe I have surmounted. As you seem interested
in the subject, and as it is an immense advantage to me to
write to you and to hear, ever so briefly, what you think,
I will enclose (copied, so as to save you trouble in reading)
the briefest abstract of my notions on the means by which
Nature makes her species. Why I think that species have
really changed, depends on general facts in the affinities,
embryology, rudimentary organs, geological history, and geo-

graphical distribution of organic beings. In regard to my
Abstract, you must take immensely on trust, each paragraph
occupying one or two chapters in my book. You will,
perhaps, think it paltry in me, when I ask you not to mention
my doctrine ; the reason is, if any one, like the author of the
 Vestiges, were to hear of them, he might easily work them
in, and then I should have to quote from a work perhaps
despised by naturalists, and this would greatly injure any
chance of my views being received by those alone whose
opinions I value. [Here follows a discussion on large
genera varying, which has no direct connection with the
remainder of the letter.]
I. It is wonderful what the principle of Selection by Man,
that is the picking out of individuals with any desired quality,
and breeding from them, and again picking out, can do.
Even breeders have been astonished at their own results.
They can act on differences inappreciable to an uneducated
eye. Selection has been metlwdically followed in Europe for
only the last half century. But it has occasionally, and even
in some degree methodically, been followed in the most
ancient times. There must have been also a kind of uncon-
scious selection from the most ancient times, namely, in the
preservation of the individual animals (without any thought of
their offspring) most useful to each race of man in his par-
ticular circumstances. The  roguing, as nursery-men call the
destroying of varieties, which depart from their type, is a kind
of selection. I am convinced that intentional and occasional
selection has been the main agent in making our domestic
races. But, however this may be, its great power of modifi-
cation has been indisputably shown in late times. Selection
acts only by the accumulation of very slight or greater
variations, caused by external conditions, or by the mere
fact that in generation the child is not absolutely similar to
its parent. Man, by this power of accumulating variations,
adapts living beings to his wants  he may be said to make

the wool of one sheep good for carpets, and another for
cloth, &c.
II. Now, suppose there was a being, who did not judge by-
mere external appearance, but could study the whole internal
organisation  who never was capricious  who should go on
selecting for one end during millions of generations, who will
say what he might not effect 1 In nature we have some slight
variations, occasionally in all parts ; and I think it can be
shown that a change in the conditions of existence is the
main cause of the child not exactly resembling its parents ;
and in nature, geology shows us what changes have taken
place, and are taking place. We have almost unlimited time ;
no one but a practical geologist can fully appreciate this :
think of the Glacial period, during the whole of which the
same species of shells at least have existed ; there must
have been during this period, millions on millions of
generations.
III. I think it can be shown that there is such an unerring
power at work, or Natural Selection (the title of my book),
which selects exclusively for the good of each organic being.
The elder De Candolle, W. Herbert, and Lyell, have written
strongly on the struggle for life; but even they have not
written strongly enough. Reflect that every being (even the
elephant) breeds at such a rate that, in a few years, or at most
a few centuries or thousands of years, the surface of the earth
would not hold the progeny of any one species. I have found
it hard constantly to bear in mind that the increase of every
single species is checked during some part of its life, or during
some shortly recurrent generation. Only a few of those
annually born can live to propagate their kind. What a
trifling difference must often determine which shall survive
and which perish 1
IV. Now take the case of a country undergoing some
change ; this will tend to cause some of its inhabitants to vary
slightly ; not but what I believe most beings vary at all times
124 the writing of the origin of species. [1858.
enough for selection to act on. Some of its inhabitants will
be exterminated, and the remainder will be exposed to the
mutual action of a different set of inhabitants, which I believe
to be more important to the life of each being than mere
climate. Considering the infinitely various ways beings have
to obtain food by struggling with other beings, to escape
danger at various times of life, to have their eggs or seeds
disseminated, &c. &c., I cannot doubt that during millions of
generations individuals of a species will be born with some
slight variation profitable to some part of its economy ; such
will have a better chance of surviving, propagating this varia-
tion, which again will be slowly increased by the accumulative
action of natural selection ; and the variety thus formed will
either coexist with, or more commonly will exterminate its
parent form. An organic being like the woodpecker, or
the mistletoe, may thus come to be adapted to a score of
contingencies ; natural selection, accumulating those slight
variations in all parts of its structure which are in any way
useful to it, during any part of its life.
V. Multiform difficulties will occur to every one on this
theory. Most can, I think, be satisfactorily answered.
Natura non facit saltum  answer some of the most obvi-
ous. The slowness of the change, and only a very few under-
going change at any one time answers others. The extreme
imperfections of our geological records answer others.
VI. One other principle, which maybe called the principle
of divergence, plays, I believe, an important part in the origin
of species. The same spot will support more life if occupied
by very diverse forms : we see this in the many generic forms
in a square yard of turf (I have counted twenty species
belonging to eighteen genera), or in the plants and insects,
on any little uniform islet, belonging to almost as many
genera and families as to species. We can understand this
with the higher animals, whose habits we best understand.
We know that it has been experimentally shown that a plot
1858.] THE LETTER TO DR. GRAY. 12$
of land will yield a greater weight, if cropped with several
species of grasses, than with two or three species. Now every
single organic being, by propagating rapidly, may be said to
be striving its utmost to increase in numbers. So it will be
with the offspring of any species after it has broken into
varieties, or sub-species, or true species. And it follows, I
think, from the foregoing facts, that the varying offspring of
each species will try (only few will succeed) to seize on as
many and as diverse places in the economy of nature as
possible. Each new variety or species when formed will
generally take the place of, and so exterminate its less well-
fitted parent This, I believe, to be the origin of the classifi-
cation or arrangement of all organic beings at all times.
These always seem to branch and sub-branch like a tree
from a common trunk ; the flourishing twigs destroying the
less vigorous  the dead and lost branches rudely representing
extinct genera and families.
This sketch is most imperfect ; but in so short a space I
cannot make it better. Your imagination must fill up many
wide blanks. Without some reflection, it will appear all
rubbish ; perhaps it will appear so after reflection.
C. Darwin.
P.S.  This little abstract touches only the accumulative
power of natural selection, which I look at as by far the most
important element in the production of new forms. The laws
governing the incipient or primordial variation (unimportant
except as the groundwork for selection to act on, in which
respect it is all important), I shall discuss under several
heads, but I can come, as you may well believe, only to very
partial and imperfect conclusions.
[The joint paper of Mr. Wallace and my father was read at
the Linnean Society on the evening of July ist Sir Charles
Lyell and Sir J. D. Hooker were present, and both, I believe,
made a few remarks, chiefly with a view of impressing on those

present the necessity of giving the most careful consideration
to what they had heard. There was, however, no semblance
of a discussion. Sir Joseph Hooker writes to me: The
interest excited was intense, but the subject was too novel
and too ominous for the old school to enter the lists, before
armouring. After the meeting it was talked over with bated
breath : Lyells approval, and perhaps in a small way mine,
as his lieutenant in the affair, rather overawed the Fellows,
who would otherwise have flown out against the doctrine.
We had, too, the vantage ground of being familiar with the
authors and their theme.]

My dear Hooker,  ^We are become more happy and
less panic-struck, now that we have sent out of the house
every child, and shall remove H., as soon as she can move.
The first nurse became ill with ulcerated throat and quinsy,
and the second is now ill with the scarlet fever, but, thank
God, is recovering. You may imagine how frightened we
have been. It has been a most miserable fortnight. Thank-
you much for your note, telling me that all had gone on
prosperously at the Linnean Society. You must let me once
again tell you how deeply I feel your generous kindness and
Lyells on this occasion. But in truth it shames me that
you should have lost time on a mere point of priority. I
shall be curious to see the proofs. I do not in the least
understand whether my letter to A. Gray is to be printed ;
I suppose not, only your note ; but I am quite indifferent,
and place myself absolutely in your and Lyells hands.

Directly after my return home, I would begin and cut my
cloth to my measure. If the Referees were to reject it as not
strictly scientific, I could, perhaps, publish it as a pamphlet.
With respect to my big interleaved abstract,* would you
send it any time before you leave England, to the enclosed
address? If you do not go till August yth-ioth, I should
prefer it left with you. I hope you have jotted criticisms on
my MS. on big Genera, &c., sufficient to make you remember
your remarks, as I should be infinitely sorry to lose them.
And I see no chance of our meeting if you go soon abroad.
We thank you heartily for your invitation to join you : I can
fancy nothing which I should enjoy more ; but our children
are too delicate for us to leave; I should be mere living
lumber.
Lastly, you said you would write to Wallace ; I certainly
should much like this, as it would quite exonerate me : if you
would send me your note, sealed up, I would fonvard it with
my own, as I know the address, &c.
Will you answer me some time about your notions of the
length of my abstract.
If you see Lyell, will you tell him how truly grateful I feel
for his kind interest in this affair of mine. You must know that
I look at it, as very important, for the reception of the view
of species not being immutable, the fact of the greatest
Geologist and Botanist in England taking any sort of interest
in the subject: I am sure it will do much to break down
prejudices.

My dear Hooker,  ^Your letter to Wallace seems to me
perfect, quite clear and most courteous. I do not think it
could possibly be improved, and I have to-day forwarded it
with a letter of my own. I always thought it very possible
that I might be forestalled, but I fancied that I had a grand
enough soul not to care ; but I found myself mistaken and
punished ; I had, however, quite resigned myself, and had
written half a letter to Wallace to give up all priority to him,
and should certainly not have changed had it not been for
Lyells and your quite extraordinary kindness. I assure you
I feel it, and shall not forget it I am more than satisfied at
what took place at the Linnean Society. 1 had thought
that your letter and mine to Asa Gray were to be only an
appendix to Wallaces paper.
We go from here in a few days to the sea-side, probably
to the Isle of Wight, and on my return (after a battle with
pigeon skeletons) I will set to work at the abstract, though
how on earth I shall make anything of an abstract in thirty
pages of the Journal, I know not, but will try my best. I shall
order Bentham ; is it not a pity that you should waste time
in tabulating varieties ? for I can get the Down schoolmaster
to do it on my return, and can tell you all the results.
I must try and see you before your journey ; but do not
think I am fishing to ask you to come to Down, for you will
have no time for that.
You cannot imagine how pleased I am that the notion of
Natural Selection has acted as a purgative on your bowels of
immutability. Whenever naturalists can look at species
changing as certain, what a magnificent field will be open,
on all the laws of variation,  on the genealogy of all living
beings,  on their lines of migration, &c. &c. Pray thank

to do justice to the subject, except by giving the facts on
which each conclusion is grounded, and that will, of course,
be absolutely impossible. Your name and- Hookers name

which does not seem to me of some interest, and which was

glad I have begun in earnest on it.

My dear Hooker,  I should think the note apologetical
about the style of the Abstract was best as a note .... But
I write now to ask you to send me by return of post the MS.
on big genera, that I may make an abstract of a couple of
pages in length. I presume that you have quite done with it,
otherwise I would not for anything have it back. If you tie
it with string, and mark it MS. for printing, it will not cost,
I should think, more than 4//. I shall wish much to say that
you have read this MS. and concur ; but you shall, before I
read it to the Society, hear the sentence.
What you tell me after speaking with Busk about the length
of the Abstract is an immense relief to me ; it will make the
labour far less, not having to shorten so much every single
subject ; but I will try not to be too diffusive. I fear it will
spoil all interest in my book,* whenever published. The
Abstract, will do very well to divide into several parts : thus I
have just finished  Variation under Domestication, in forty-
four MS. pages, and that would do for one evening ; but I
should be extremely sorry if all could not be published
together.
What else you say about my Abstract pleases me highly,
but frightens me, for I fear I shall never be able to make
it good enough. But how I do run on about my own affairs

My dear Hooker,  I write merely to say that the MS.
came safely two or three days ago. I am much obliged for
the correction of style : I find it unutterably difficult to write
clearly. When we meet I must talk over a few points on the
You speak of going to the sea-side somewhere ; we think
this the nicest sea-side place which we have ever seen,
and we like Shanklin better than other spots on the south
coast of the island, though many are charming and prettier,
so that I would suggest your thinking of this place. We are
on the actual coast ; but tastes differ so much about places.
If you go to Broadstairs, when there is a strong wind from
the coast of France and in fine, dry, warm weather, look out
and you will probably (1) see thistle-seeds blown across the
Channel. The other day I saw one blown right inland, and
then in a few minutes a second one and then a third ; and I
said to myself, God bless me, how many thistles there must be
in France ; and I wrote a letter in imagination to you. But
I then looked at the low clouds, and noticed that they were
not coming inland, so I feared a screw was loose, I then walked
beyond a headland and found the wind parallel to the coast,
and on this very headland a noble bed of thistles, which by
every wide eddy were blown far out to sea, and then came
right in at right angles to the shore 1 One day such a number
of insects were washed up by the tide, and I brought to life
thirteen species of Coleoptera ; not that I suppose these came
from France. But do you watch for thistle-seed as you saunter
along the coast. . . .

CLIMATE AND MIGRATION.
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to Asa Gray.
Aug. mh [1858].
My dear Gray,  Your note of July 27th has just reached
me in the Isle of Wight. It is a real and great pleasure to me
to write to you about my notions ; and even if it were not so,
I should be a most ungrateful dog, after all the invalu-
able assistance which you have rendered me, if I did not do
anything which you asked.
I have discussed in my long MS. the later changes of
climate and the effect on migration, and I will here give you
an abstract of an abstract (which latter I am preparing of
my whole work for the Linnean Society). I cannot give
you facts, and I must write dogmatically, though I do not
feel so on any point. I may just mention, in order that you
may believe that I have some foundation for my views, that
Hooker has read my MS., and though he at first demurred to
my main point, he has since told me that further reflection
and new facts have made him a convert.
In the older, or perhaps newer, Pliocene age (a little
before the Glacial epoch) the temperature was higher ; of
this there can be little doubt ; the land, on a large scale,
held much its present disposition ; the species were mainly,
judging from shells, what they are now. At this period
when all animals and plants ranged 10�� or 15�� nearer the
poles, I believe the northern part of Siberia and of North
America, being almost continuous, were peopled (it is quite
possible, considering the shallow water, that Behring Straits
were united, perhaps a little southward) by a nearly uniform
fauna and flora, just as the Arctic regions now are. The
climate then became gradually colder till it became what
it now is ; and then the temperate parts of Europe and
America would be separated, as far as migration is concerned,
just as they now are. Then came on the Glacial period,
driving far south all living things ; middle or even southern

136 THE WRITING OF THE 'ORIGIN OF SPECIES. [1858.
Europe being peopled with Arctic productions ; as the warmth
returned, the Arctic productions slowly crawled up the moun-
tains as they became denuded of snow ; and we now see on
their summits the remnants of a once continuous flora and
fauna. This is E. Forbess theory, which, however, I may
add, I had written out four years before he published.
Some facts have made me vaguely suspect that between
the glacial and the present temperature there was a period
of slightly greater warmth. According to my modification-
doctrines, I look at many of the species of North America
which closely represent those of Europe, as having become
modified since the Pliocene period, when in the northern part
of the world there was nearly free communication between
the old and new worlds. But now comes a more important
consideration ; there is a considerable body of geological
evidence that during the Glacial epoch the whole world was
colder ; I inferred that, many years ago, from erratic boulder
phenomena carefully observed by me on both the east and
west coast of South America. Now I am so bold as to
believe that at the height of the Glacial epoch, and when all
Tropical productions must have been considerably distressed,
several temperate forms slowly travelled into the heart of the
Tropics, and even reached the southern hemisphere ; and some
few southern forms penetrated in a reverse direction north-
ward. (Heights of Borneo with Australian forms, Abyssinia
with Cape forms.) Wherever there was nearly continuous high
land, this migration would have been immensely facilitated ;
hence the European character of the plants of Tierra del Fuego
and summits of Cordilleras ; hence ditto on Himalaya. As the
temperature rose, all the temperate intruders would crawl up
the mountains. Hence the European forms on Nilgherries,
Ceylon, summit of Java, Organ Mountains of Brazil. But
these intruders being surrounded with new forms would be
very liable to be improved or modified by natural selection,
to adapt them to the new forms with which they had to

137
compete ; hence most of the forms on the mountains of the
Tropics are not identical, but representative forms of North
temperate plants.
There are similar classes of facts in marine productions.
All this will appear very rash to you, and rash it may be ;
but I am sure not so rash as it will at first appear to you :
Hooker could not stomach it at all at first, but has become
largely a convert. From mammalia and shallow sea, I believe
Japan to have been joined to main land of China within no
remote period ; and then the migration north and south
before, during, and after the Glacial epoch would act on
Japan, as on the corresponding latitude of China and the
United States.
I should beyond anything like to know whether you have
any Alpine collections from Japan, and what is their character.
This letter is miserably expressed, but perhaps it will suffice
to show what I believe have been the later main migrations
and changes of temperature. . . .

constantiy received sympathy. Beiieve [me] that I never forget
for even a minute how much assistance I have received from

my specuiations were a "jam-pot" to you ; indeed, I thought,

you, and this has often staggered me. Nor did I know that
you had spoken in generai terms about my work to our
friends, excepting to dear oid Faiconer, who some few years
ago once told me that I should do more mischief than any ten
other naturalists would do good, [and] that I had half-spoiled
you already ! All this is stupid egotistical stuff, and I write
it only because you may think me ungrateful for not having
valued and understood your sympathy ; which God knows is
not the case. It is an accursed evil to a man to become so
absorbed in any subject as I am in mine.

beetles in helping his boys in their collecting. He sent a

the words, We three very young collectors having lately

general argument of the so-called development theory seems
to me admirable. I am at present preparing an Abstract of a
larger work on the changes of species ; but I treat the subject
simply as a naturalist, and not from a general point of view,
otherwise, in my opinion, your argument could not have been
improved on, and might have been quoted by me with great
advantage. Your article on Music has also interested me
much, for I had often thought on the subject, and had come

support the notion in any detail. Furthermore, by a curious
coincidence, expression has been for years a persistent subject

you that all expression has some biological meaning. I hope
to profit by your criticism on style, and with very best thanks,

My dear Hooker,  Your news about your unsolicited
salary and house is jolly, and creditable to the Government.
My room (28 x 19), with divided room above, with all
fixtures (and painted), not furniture, and plastered outside,
cost about ;��'500. I am heartily glad of this news.
Your facts about distribution arc, indeed, very striking.
I remember well that none of your many wonderful facts
in your several works, perplexed me, for years, more than
the migration having been mainly from north to south, and not
in the reverse direction. I have now at last satisfied myself
(but that is very different from satisfying others) on this
head ; but it would take a little volume to fully explain
myself. I did not for long see the bearing of a conclusion,
at which I had arrived, with respect to this subject It is,
that species inhabiting a very large area, and therefore exist-
ing in large numbers, and which have been subjected to the
severest competition with many other forms, will have
arrived, through natural selection, at a higher stage of per-
fection than the inhabitants of a small area. Thus I ex-
plain the fact of so many anomalies, or what may be called
 living fossils, inhabiting now only fresh water, having been
beaten out, and exterminated in the sea, by more im-

proved forms ; thus all existing Ganoid fishes are fresh water,
as [are] Lepidosiren and Omithorhynchus, &c. The plants of
Europe with Asia, as being the largest territory, I look at as
the most  improved, and therefore as being able to with-
stand the less-perfected Australian plants ; though these could
not resist the Indian. See how all the productions of New
Zealand yield to those of Europe. I dare say you will think
all this utter bosh, but I believe it to be solid truth.
You will, I think, admit that Australian plants, flourishing
so in India, is no argument that they could hold their own
against the ten thousand natural contingencies of other plants,
insects, animals, &c. &c. CTTXTHR With respect to South-West Australia
and the Cape, I am shut up, and can only d  n the whole
case.
. . . You say you should like to see my MS., but you did
read and approved of my long Glacial chapter, and I have
not yet written my Abstract on the whole of the Geographical
Distribution, nor shall I begin it for two or three weeks.
But either Abstract or the old MS. I should be delighted to
send you, especially the Abstract chapter. . . .
I have now written 330 folio pages of my Abstract, and it
will require 150-200; so that it will make a printed volume
of 400 pages, and must be printed separately, which I think
will be better in many respects. The subject really seems to
me too large for discussion at any Society, and I believe
religion would be brought in by men whom I know.

My dear Hooker,  I should very much like to borrow
Heer at some future time, for I want to read nothing per-
plexing at present till my Abstract is done. Your last very
instructive letter shall make me very cautious on the hyper-
speculative points we have been discussing.
When you say you cannot master the train of thoughts,
I know well enough that they are too doubtful and obscure to
be mastered. I have often experienced what you call the
humiliating feeling of getting more and more involved in
doubt, the more one thinks of the facts and reasoning on
doubtful points. But I always comfort myself with thinking
of the future, and in the full belief that the problems which we
are just entering on, will some day be solved ; and if we just
break the ground we shall have done some service, even if we
reap no harvest
I quite agree that we only differ in degree about the means
of dispersal, and that I think a satisfactory amount of accord-
ance. You put in a very striking manner the mutation of our
continents, and I quite agree ; I doubt only about our oceans.
I also agree (I am in a very agreeing frame of mind) with
your argumentum ad hominem, about the highness of the
Australian Flora from the number of species and genera ; but
here comes in a superlative bothering element of doubt, viz.
the effects of isolation.
The only point in which I presumptuously rather demur
is about the status of the naturalised plants in Australia. 1
think Muller speaks of their having spread largely beyond
cultivated ground ; and I can hardly believe that our Euro-
pean plants would occupy stations so barren that the native
plants could not live there. I should require much evidence
to make me believe this. I have written this note merely to
thank you, as you will see it requires no answer.

My dear Sir,  I was extremely much pleased at receiving
three days ago your letter to me and that to Dr. Hooker.
Permit me to say how heartily I admire the spirit in which
they are written. Though I had absolutely nothing whatever
to do in leading Lyell and Hooker to what they thought a
fair course of action, yet I naturally could not but feel anxious
to hear what your impression would be. I owe indirectly
much to you and them ; for I almost think that Lyell would
have proved right, and I should never have completed my
larger work, for I have found my Abstract hard enough with
ray poor health, but now, thank God, I am in my last chapter
but one. My Abstract will make a small volume of 400 or
500 pages. Whenever published, I will, of course, send you a
copy, and then you will see what I mean about the part
which I believe selection has played with domestic produc-

tions. It is a very different part, as you suppose, from that
played by  Natural Selection. I sent off by the same address
as this note, a copy of the Journal of the Linnean Society,
and subsequently I have sent some half-dozen copies of the
paper. I have many other copies at your disposal. . . .
I am glad to hear that you have been attending to birds
nests. I have done so, though almost exclusively under one
point of view, viz. to show that instincts vary, so that selec-
tion could work on and improve them. Few other instincts,
so to speak, can be preserved in a Museum.
Many thanks for your offer to look after horses stripes ; if
there are any donkeys, pray add them. I am delighted
to hear that you have collected bees combs This is
an especial hobby of mine, and I think I can throw a light
on the subject If you can collect duplicates, at no very
great expense, I should be glad of some specimens for myself
with some bees of each kind. Young, growing, and irregular
combs, and those which have not had pupae, are most valuable
for measurements and examination. Their edges should be
well protected against abrasion.
Every one whom I have seen has thought your paper very
well written and interesting. It puts my extracts (written in
1839, now just twenty years ago !), which I must say in apo-
logy were never for an instant intended for publication, into
the shade.
You cisk about Lyells frame of mind. I think he is some-
what staggered, but does not give in, and speaks with horror,
often to me, of what a thing it would be, and what a job it
would be for the next edition of  The Principles, if he were
" perverted. But he is most candid and honest, and I think
will end by being perverted. Dr. Hooker has become almost
as heterodox as you or I, and I look at Hooker as by far the
most capable judge in Europe.
Most cordially do I wish you health and entire success in
all your pursuits, and, God knows, if admirable zeal and
energy deserve success, most amply do you deserve it I look

I shall look at my course as done.
Believe me, my dear sir, yours very sincerely,
C. Darwin.
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to J. D. Hooker.
Down, March and [1859].
My dear Hooker,  Here is an odd, though very little,
fact. I think it would be hardly possible to name a bird
which apparently could have less to do with distribution than
a Petrel. Sir W. Milner, at St. Kilda, cut open some young
nestling Petrels, and he found large, curious nuts in their crops ;
I suspect picked up by parent birds from the Gulf stream.
He seems to value these nuts excessively. I have asked him
(but I doubt whether he will) to send a nut to Sir William
Hooker (I gave this address for grandeurs sake) to see if any
of you can name it and its native country. Will you please
mention this to Sir William Hooker, and if the nut does ar-
rive, will you oblige me by returning it to Sir W.
Milner, Bart., Nunappleton, Tadcaster, in a registered
letter, and I will repay you postage. Enclose slip of paper
with the name and country if you can, and let me hereafter
know. Forgive me asking you to take this much trouble ; for
it is a funny little fact after my own heart.
Now for another subject. I have finished my Abstract of
the chapter on Geographical Distribution, as bearing on my
subject. I should like you much to read it ; but I say this,
believing that you will not do so, if, as I believe to be the
case, you arc extra busy. On my honour, I shall not be
mortified, and I earnestly beg you not to do it, if it will
bother you. I want it, because I here feel especially unsafe,
and errors may have crept in. Also, I should much like to
know what parts you will most vehemently object to. I know

we do, and must, differ widely on several heads. Lastly, I
should like particularly to know whether I have taken any-
thing from you, which you would like to retain for first publi-
cation ; but I think I have chiefly taken from your published
works, and, though I have several times, in this chapter and
elsewhere, acknowledged your assistance, I am aware that it
is not possible for me in the Abstract to do it sufficiently.*
But again let me say that you must not offer to read it if very
irksome. It is long  about ninety pages, I expect, when
fully copied out.
I hope you are all well. Moor Park has done me some good.
Yours affectionately,
C. Darwin.
P.S.  Heaven forgive me, here is another question : How
far am I right in supposing that with plants, the most import-
ant characters for main divisions are embryological } The
seed itself cannot be considered as such, I suppose, nor the
albumen, &c. But I suppose the cotyledons and their posi-
tion, and the position of the plumule and the radicle, and the
position and form of the whole embryo in the seed are
embryological, and how far are these very important ? I wish
to instance plants as a case of high importance of embryo-
logical characters in classification. In the Animal Kingdom
there is, of course, no doubt of this.

I have been so poorly, the last three days, that I sometimes
doubt whether I shall ever get my little volume done, though
so nearly completed. . . .
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to J. D. Hooker.
Down, March 15th [1859].
My dear Hooker,  I am pleased at what you say of my
chapter. You have not attacked it nearly so much as I
feared you would. You do not seem to have detected many
errors. It was nearly all written from memory, and hence I
was particularly fearful ; it would have been better if the
whole had first been carefully written out, and abstracted
afterwards. I look at it as morally certain that it must
include much error in some of its general views. I will just
run over a few points in your note, but do not trouble yourself
to reply without you have something important to say. . . .
... I should like to know whether the case of endemic
bats in islands struck you ; it has me especially ; perhaps too
strongly.
With hearty thanks, ever yours,
C. Darwin.
P.S.  You cannot tell what a relief it has been to me
your looking over this chapter, as I felt very shaky on it.
I shall to-morrow finish my last chapter (except a re-

and the facts seem to me to come out very strong for
mutability of species.
I have been much interested in working out the chapter.
I shall now, thank God, begin looking over old first chapters
for press.
But my health is now so very poor, that even this will take
me long.
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to W. D. Fox.
Down, [March] 24th [1859].
My dear Fox,  It was very good of you to write to me
in the midst of all your troubles, though you seem to have
got over some of them, in the recovery of your wifes and
your own health. I had not heard lately of your mothers
health, and am sorry to hear so poor an account. But as
she does not suffer much, that is the great thing ; for mere
life I do not think is much valued by the old. What a time
you must have had of it, when you had to go backwards
and forwards.
We are all pretty well, and our eldest daughter is improving.
I can see daylight through my work, and am now finally
correcting my chapters for the press ; and I hope in a month
or six weeks to have proof-sheets. I am weary of my work.
It is a very odd thing that I have no sensation that I over-
work my brain ; but facts compel me to conclude that my
brain was never formed for much thinking. We are resolved
to go for two or three months, when I have finished, to Ilkley,
or some such place, to see if I can anyhow give my health
a good start, for it certainly has been wretched of late, and
has incapacitated me for everything. You do me injustice
when you think that I work for fame ; I value it to a certain
extent ; but, if I know myself, I work from a sort of instinct
to try to make out truth. How glad I should be if you could
sometime come to Down ; especially when I get a little better.

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to C. Lyell.
Down, March 28th [1859].
My dear Lyell,  If I keep decently well, I hope to be
able to go to press with my volume early in May. This being
so, I want much to beg a little advice from you. From an
expression in Lady Lyells note, I fancy that you have
spoken to Murray. Is it so ? And is he willing to publish
my Abstract? If you will tell me whether anything, and
what has passed, I will then write to him. Does he know at
all of the subject of the book ? Secondly, can you advise me,
whether I had better state what terms of publication I should
prefer, or first ask him to propose terms ? And what do you
think would be fair terms for an edition ? Share profits, or
what?
Lastly, will you be so very kind as to look at the enclosed
title and give me your opinion and any criticisms ; you must
remember that, if I have health and it appears worth doing, I
have a much larger and full book on the same subject nearly
ready.
My Abstract will be about five hundred pages of the size of
your first edition of the  Elements of Geology.
Pray forgive me troubling you with the above queries ; and
you shall have no more trouble on the subject. I hope the
world goes well with you, and that you are getting on with
your various works.
I am working very hard for me, and long to finish and be
free and try to recover some health.
My dear Lyell, ever yours,
C. Darwin.
152 THE WRITING OF THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES. [1859.
Very sincere thanks to you for standing my proxy for the
Wollaston Medal.
P.S.  Would you advise me to tell Murray that my book
is not more ��n-orthodox than the subject makes inevitable.
That I do not discuss the origin of man. That I do not bring
in any discussion about Genesis, &c. &c., and only give facts,
and such conclusions from them as seem to me fair.
Or had I better say nothing to Murray, and assume that
he cannot object to this much unorthodoxy, which in fact
is not more than any Geological Treatise which runs slap
counter to Genesis.

My DEAR Lyell,  ^You have been uncommonly kind in
all you have done. You not only have saved me much
trouble and some anxiety, but have done all incomparably
better than I could have done it I am much pleased at
all you say about Murray. I will write either to-day or

MS., but unfortunately I cannot for a week, as the first three
chapters are in the copyists hands.
I am sorry about Murray objecting to the term Abstract,
as I look at it as the only possible apology for not giving
references and facts in full, but I will defer to him and you.
I am also sorry about the term  natural selection. I hope
to retain it with explanation somewhat as thus :
 Through natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races.
Why I like the term is that it is constantly used in all
works on breeding, and I am surprised that it is not familiar
to Murray ; but I have so long studied such works that I
have ceased to be a competent judge.
I again most truly and cordially thank you for your
really valuable assistance.
Yours most truly,
C. Darwin.
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to J. D. Hooker.
Down, April and [1859].
.... I wrote to him [Mr. Murray] and gave him the
headings of the chapters, and told him he could not have the
MS. for ten days or so ; and this morning I received a letter,
offering me handsome terms, and agreeing to publish with-
out seeing the MS. ! So he is eager enough ; I think I
should have been cautious, anyhow, but, owing to your letter,
I told him most explicitly that I accept his offer solely on con-
dition that, after he has seen part or all the MS., he has full
power of retracting. You will think me presumptuous, but
I think my book will be popular to a certain extent (enough
to ensure [against] heavy loss) amongst scientific and semi-
scientific men ; why I think so is, because I have, found in
conversation so great and surprising an interest amongst such
men, and some 0-scientific [non-scientific] men on this subject.

and all my chapters are not nearly so dry and dull as that
which you have read on geographical distribution. Anyhow,
Murray ought to be the best judge, and if he chooses to publish
it, I think I may wash my hands of all responsibility. I am
sure my friends, ��>. Lyell and you, have been extraordinarily
kind in troubling yourselves on the matter.
I shall be delighted to see you the day before Good
Friday ; there would be one advantage for you in any other
day  as I believe both my boys come home on that day
and it would be almost impossible that I could send the
carriage for you. There will, I believe, be some relations in
the house  ^but I hope you will not care for that, as we shall
easily get as much talking as my imbecile state allows. I
shall deeply enjoy seeing you.
.... I am tired, so no more.
My dear Hooker, your affectionate,
C. Darwin.
P.S.  Please to send, well tied up with strong string, my
Geographical MS., towards the latter half of next week
i.e. 7th or 8th  that I may send it with more to Murray;
and God help him if he tries to read it
.... I cannot help a little doubting whether Lyell would
take much pains to induce Murray to publish my book ; this
was not done at my request, and it rather grates against my
pride.
I know that Lyell has been infinitely kind about my affair,
but your dashed [i.e. underlined] induce gives the idea that
Lyell had unfairly urged Murray.

may depend, forget a request which I look at as a favour. But
(and it is a heavy  but  to me) it will be long before I go to
press ; I can truly say I am //ever idle ; indeed, I work too
hard for my much weakened health ; yet I can do only three
hours of work daily, and I cannot at all see when I shall have
finished : I have done eleven long chapters, but I have got
some other very difficult ones : as paleontology, classifica-
tions, and embryology, &c., and I have to correct and add
largely to all those done. I find, alas ! each chapter takes me
on an average three months, so slow I am. There is no end
to the necessary digressions. I have just finished a chapter
on instinct, and here I found grappling with such a subject as
bees cells, and comparing all my notes made during twenty
years, took up a despairing length of time.
But I am running on about myself in a most egotistical
style Yet I must just say how useful I have again and again
found your letters, which I have lately been looking over and
quoting ! but you need not fear that I shall quote anything
you would dislike, for I try to be very cautious on this
head. I most heartily hope you may succeed in getting your

remarks on a separate page), and the first three chapters.

It may be conceit, but I believe the subject will interest
the public, and I am sure that the views arc original If you
think otherwise, I must repeat my request that you will freely

I shall be in no way injured.
If you choose to read Chapters II. and III., you will have
a dull and rather abstruse chapter, and a plain and interesting
one, in my opinion.
As soon as you have done with the MS., please to send it
by cartful messenger, and plainly directed, to Miss G. Tollett,
14, Queen Anne Street, Cavendish Square.
This lady, being an excellent judge of style, is going to
look out for errors for me.
You must take your own time, but the sooner you finish,
the sooner she will, and the sooner I shall get to press, which
I so earnestly wish.
I presume you will wish to see Chapter IV., the key-stone
of my arch, and Chapters X. and XL, but please to inform
me on this head.
My dear Sir, yours sincerely,
C. Darwin.

one MS. (and this includes a very dull one, and he abides by
his offer). Hence he does not want more MS., and you can

for if it prove a dead failure, it would make me the more

This speculation of Messrs. Darwin and Wallace would
not be worthy of notice were it not for the weight of authority

has been brought forward. If it means what it says, it is a
truism ; if it means anything more, it is contrary to fact

My dear Hooker,  Thank you for telling me about
obscurity of style. But on my life no nigger with lash over
him could have worked harder at clearness than I have done.
But the very difficulty to me, of itself leads to the probability
that I fail. Yet one lady who has read all my MS. has
found only two or three obscure sentences, but Mrs. Hooker
having so found it, makes me tremble. I will do my best in
proofs. You are a good man to take the trouble to write

thought we could not make our ideas clear to each other by
talk, or if either of us had time to write in extenso.
I imagine from some expressions (but if you ask me what,
I could not answer) that you look at variability as some
necessary contingency with organisms, and further that there
is some necessary tendency in the variability to go on
diverging in character or degree. If you do, I do not agree.
" Reversion  again (a form of inheritance), I look at as in
no way directly connected with Variation, though of course
inheritance is of fundamental importance to us, for if a
variation be not inherited, it- is of no signification to us. It
was on such points as these I fancied that we perhaps started
differently.
I fear that my book will not deserve at all the pleasant
things you say about it ; and Good Lord, how I do long to
have done with it !
Since the above was written, I have received and have
been much interested by A. Gray. I am delighted at his
note about my and Wallaces paper. He will go round, for
it is futile to give up very many species, and stop at an
arbitrary line at others. It is what my grandfather called
Unitarianism, a feather bed to catch a falling Christian. . . .

My dear Sir,  The diagram will do very well, and I
will send- it shortly to Mr. West to have a few trifling
corrections made.
I get on very slowly with proofs. I remember writing to
you that I thought there would be not much correction. I
honestly wrote what I thought, but was most grievously
mistaken. I find the style incredibly bad, and most difficult
to make clear and smooth. I am extremely sorry to say, on
account of expense, and loss of time for me, that the cor-
rections are very heavy, as heavy as possible. But from
casual glances, I still hope that later chapters are not so
badly written. How I could have svritten so badly is quite
inconceivable, but I suppose it was owing to my whole
attention being fixed on the general line of argument, and
not on details. All 1 can say is, that I am very sorry.
Yours very sincerely,
C. Darwin.
P.S.  I have been looking at the corrections, and consider-
ing them. It seems to me that I shall put you to a quite unfair
expense If you please I should like to enter into some
such arrangement as the following : When work completed,
you to allow in the account a fairly moderately heavy charge
for corrections, and all excess over that to be deducted from
my profits, or paid by me individually.

that my corrections are terrifically heavy, and the work most
difficult to me. I have corrected 130 pages, and the volume
will be about 500. I have tried my best to make it clear and
striking, but very much fear that I have failed  so many dis-
cussions are and must be very perplexing. I have done my
best. If you had all my materials, I am sure you would have
made a splendid book. I long to finish, for I am nearly

Down, 22nd [June, 1859].
My dear Hooker,  I did not answer your pleasant note,
with a good deal of news to me, of May 30th, as I have
been expecting proofs from you. But now, having nothing
particular to do, I will fly a note, though I have nothing
particular to say or ask. Indeed, how can a man have any-
thing to say, who spends every day in correcting accursed
proofs ; and such proofs ! I have fairly to blacken them, and
fasten slips of paper on, so miserable have I found the style.
You say that you dreamt that my book was entertaining; that
dream is pretty well over with me, and I begin to fear that
the public will find it intolerably dry and perplexing. But I
will never give up that a better man could have made a
splendid book out of the materials. I was glad to hear about
Prestwichs paper.* My doubt has been (and I see Wright

only a revise ; so that I presume you will soon have to decide
what number of copies to print off.
I am quite incapable of forming any opinion. I think I
have got the style fairly good and clear, with infinite trouble.

you, I really cannot conjecture. I heartily hope it may.

you for allowing me to read it. Had I read it some months-
ago, I should have profited by it for my forthcoming volume.
But my two chapters on this subject are in type, and, though
not yet corrected, I am so wearied out and weak in health,
that I am fully resolved not to add one word, and merely
improve the style. So you will see that my views are nearly
the same with yours, and you may rely on it that not one
word shall be altered owing to my having read your ideas.
Are you aware that Mr. W. Earl * [��c] published several years
ago the view of distribution of animals in the Malay Archi-
pelago, in relation to the depth of the sea between the islands >
I was much struck with this, and have been in the habit of
noting all facts in distribution in that archipelago, and else-
where, in this relation. I have been led to conclude that
there has been a good deal of naturalisation in the different
Malay islands, and which I have thought, to a certain extent,
would account for anomalies. Timor has been my greatest
puzzle. What do you say to the peculiar Felis there? I
wish that you had visited Timor ; it has been asserted that a
fossil mastodons or elephants tooth (I forget which) has been
found there, which would be a grand fact I was aware that
Celebes was very peculiar ; but the relation to Africa is quite
new to mo, and marvellous, and almost passes belief. It is as-
anomaious as the relation of filan/s in S.W. Australia to the.
Cape of Good Hope. I differ wholly from you on the colonisa-
tion of oceanic islands, but you will have every one else
on your side. I quite agree with respect to all islands not
situated far in the ocean. I quite agree on the little occa-
sional intermigration between lands [islands?] when once
pretty well stocked with inhabitants, but think this does not
apply to rising and ill-stocked islands. Are you aware that
annually birds are blown to Madeira, the Azores (and to
Bermuda from America) ? I wish I had given a fuller abstract

... I am not surprised at your finding your Introduction
very difficult. But do not grudge the labour, and do not say
you  have burnt your fingers, and are  deep in the mud  ;
for I feel sure that the result will be well worth the labour.
Unless I am a fool, I must be a judge to some extent of the
value of such general essays, and I am fully convinced that
yours are the most valuable ever published.
I have corrected all but the last two chapters of my book,
and hope to have done revises and all in about three weeks,
and then I (or we all) shall start for some months hydropathy ;

child, and incapable of doing anything whatever, except my
three hours daily work at proof-sheets. God knows whether
I shall ever be good for anything again, perhaps a long rest
and hydropathy may do something.
I have not had A. Grays Essay, and should not feel up to
criticise it, even if I had the impertinence and courage. You
will believe me that I speak strictly the truth when I say
that your Australian Essay is extremely interesting to me,
rather too much so. I enjoy reading it over, and if you think
my criticisms are worth anything to you, I beg you to send

... I am very glad you wish to see my clean sheets : I should
have offered them, but did not know whether it would bore
you ; I wrote by this mornings post to Murray to send them.
Unfortunately I have not got to the part which will interest
you, I think most, and which tells most in favour of the view,
viz. Geological Succession, Geographical Distribution, and espe-
cially Morphology, Embryology and Rudimentary Oi^ans. I
will see that the remaining sheets, when printed off, are sent to

revises of the sheets as I correct them ? if so, send me your

whether dull (especially latter part of Chapter II.) or not, for
I am convinced there is not a sentence which has not a
bearing on the whole argument. You will find Chapter IV.
perplexing and unintelligible, without the aid of the enclosed

quite clear. Do not, I beg, be in a hurry in committing
yourself (like so many naturalists) to go a certain length and
no further ; for I am deeply convinced that it is absolutely
necessary to go the whole vast length, or stick to the creation
of each separate species ; I argue this point briefly in the last
chapter. Remember that your verdict will probably have
more influence than my book in deciding whether such
views as I hold will be admitted or rejected at present ; in
the future I cannot doubt about their admittance, and our
posterity will marvel as much about the current belief as we
do about fossil shells having been thought to have been
created as we now see them. But forgive me for running

My dear Hooker,  I corrected the last proof yesterday,
and I have now my revises, index, &c, which will take me
near to the end of the month. So that the neck of my
work, thank God, is broken.
I write now to say that I am uneasy in my conscience
about hesitating to look over your proofs, but I was feeling
miserably unwell and shattered when I wrote. I do not
suppose I could be of hardly any use, but if I could, pray
send me any proofs. I should be (and fear I was) the most
ungrateful man to hesitate to do anything for you after some
fifteen or more years help from you.
As soon as ever I have fairly finished I shall be off to Ilkley,
or some other Hydropathic establishment. But I shall be some
time yet, as my proofs have been so utterly obscured with
corrections, that I have to correct heavily on revises.

be converted) than my book ; yet as I regard your verdict
as far more important in my own eyes, and I believe in the

rise to races and permanent varieties
in animals and plants, are the same
as those which in much longer

to differences of generic rank. He

important of all on the favourable side. The last chapter,
which sums up, and balances in a mass, all the arguments
contra and pro, will, I think, be useful to you. I cannot too
strongly express my conviction of the general truth of my
doctrines, and God knows I have never shirked a difficulty.
I am foolishly anxious for your verdict, not that I shall be
disappointed if you are not converted ; for I remember the
long years it took me to come round ; but I shall be most
deeply delighted if you do come round, especially if I have a
fair share in the conversion, 1 shall then feel that my career
is run, and care little whether I ever am good for anything
again in this life.
Thank you much for allowing me to put in the sentence
about your grave doubt.* So much and too much about
myself.
I have read with extreme interest in the Aberdeen paper
about the flint tools ; you have made the whole case far
clearer to me ; I suppose that you did not think the evidence
sufficient about the Glacial period.
With cordial thanks for your splendid notice of my book.

My dear Fox,  I was very glad to get your letter a few
days ago. I was wishing to hear about you, but have been
in such an absorbed, slavish, overworked state, that I had not
heart without compulsion to write to any one or do anything
beyond my daily work. Though your account of yourself is
better, I cannot think it at all satisfactory, and I wish you
would soon go to Malvern again. My father used to believe
largely in an old saying that, if a man grew thinner between

so that your stoutness, I look at as a very good omen. My
health has been as bad as it well could be all this summer ; and
I have kept on my legs, only by going at short intervals to

I have at last as good as done my book, having only the
index and two or three revises to do. It will be published
in the first week in November, and a copy shall be sent you.
Remember it is only an Abstract (but has cost me above
thirteen months to write ! 1), and facts and authorities are far
from given in full. I shall be curious to hear what you think
of it, but I am not so silly as to expect to convert you.
Lyell has read about half of the volume in clean sheets, and
gives me very great kudos. He is wavering so much about
the immutability of species, that I expect he will come round.
Hooker has come round, and will publish his belief soon. So
much for my abominable volume, which has cost me so much
labour that I almost hate it. On October 3rd I start for
Ilkley, but shall take three days for the journey! It is so
late that we shall not take a house ; but I go there alone for
three or four weeks ; then return home for a week and go to
Moor Park for three or four weeks, and then I shall get a
moderate spell of hydropathy ; and I intend, if I can keep to
my resolution, of being idle this winter. But I fear ennui
will be as bad as a bad stomach. . . .

world could be matched. Not that I think climate nearly so
important as most naturalists seem to think. In my opinion
no error is more mischievous than this.
I was very glad to find that Hooker, who read over, in
MS., my Geographical chapters, quite agreed in the view of
the greater importance of organic relations. I should like
you to consider p. 77 and reflect on the case of any organism
in the midst of its range.
I shall be curious hereafter to hear what you think of dis-
tribution during the glacial and preceding warmer periods.

been so wearied and exhausted of late that I have for months
doubted whether I have not been throwing away time and
labour for nothing. But now I care not what the universal
world says ; I have always found you right, and certainly on
this occasion I am not going to doubt for the first time.
Whether you go far, or but a very short way with me and others
who believe as I do, I am contented, for my work cannot be
in vain. You would laugh if you knew how often I have read
your paragraph, and it has acted like a little dram. . . .

I request you, after you have finished, just to re-run over the
heads in the recapitulation -part of last chapter. I shall be
deeply anxious to hear what you decide (if you are able to
decide) on the balance of the pros and contras given in my
volume, and of such other pros and contras as may occur
to you. I hope that you will think that I have given the
difficulties fairly. I feel an entire conviction that if you
are now staggered to any moderate extent, you will come
more and more round, the longer you keep the subject
at all before your mind. I remember well how many long
years it was before I could look into the face of some of the
difficulties and not feel quite abashed. I fairly struck my
colours before the case of neuter insects.
I suppose that I am a very slow thinker, for you would be
surprised at the number of years it took me to see clearly what
some of the problems were which had to be solved, such as
the necessity of the principle of divergence of character, the
extinction of intermediate varieties, on a continuous area, with
graduated conditions ; the double problem of sterile first
crosses and sterile hybrids, &c. &c.
Looking back, I think it was more difficult to see what
the problems were than to solve them, so far as I have suc-
ceeded in doing, and this seems to me rather curious. Well,
good or bad, my work, thank God, is over ; and hard work, I
can assure you, I have had, and much work which has never
borne fruit. You can see, by the way I am scribbling, that
I have an idle and rainy afternoon. I was not able to start
for Ilkley yesterday as I was too unwell ; but I hope to get
there on Tuesday or Wednesday. Do, I beg you, when you
have finished my book and thought a little over it, let me
hear from you. Never mind and pitch into me, if you think
it requisite ; some future day, in London possibly, you may

scribbled any remarks on the margin, for the chance of a

your doings, and belongings.
Is your Introduction fairly finished ? I know you will abuse
it, and I know well how much I shall like it I have been
here nearly a fortnight, and it has done me very much good,
though I sprained my ankle last Sunday, which has quite
stopped walking. All my family come here on Monday to
stop three or four v/eeks, and then I shall go back to the great
establishment, and stay a fortnight ; so that if I can keep my
spirits, I shall stay eight weeks here, and thus give hydro-
pathy a fair chance. Before starting here I was in an awful
state of stomach, strength, temper, and spirits. My book has
been completely finished some little time ; as soon as copies
are ready, of course one will be sent you. I hope you will
mark your copy with scores, so that I may profit by any
criticisms. I should like to hear your general impression.
From Lyells letters, he thinks favourably of it, but seems
staggered by the lengths to which I go. But if you go any
considerable length in the admission of modification, I can see
no possible means of drawing the line, and saying here you
must stop. Lyell is going to reread my book, and I yet enter-
tain hopes that he will be converted, or perverted, as he calls
it. Lyell has been extremely kind in writing me three volume-

How about Andersson in Sweden ? You cannot think how
refreshing it is to idle away the whole day, and hardly ever
think in the least about my confounded book which half-
killed me. I much wish I could hear of your taking a real

My DEAR Huxley,  I am here hydropathising and
coming to life again, after having finished my accursed book,
which would have been easy work to any one else, but half-
killed me. I have thought you would give me one bit of
information, and I know not to whom else to apply ; viz., the
addresses of Barrande, Von Siebold, Keyserling (I dare say
Sir Roderick would know the latter).
Can you tell me of any good and speadative foreigners to
whom it would be worth while to send copies of my book, on
the  Origin of Species  ? I doubt whether it is worth sending
to Siebold. I should like to send a few copies about, but
how many I can afford I know not yet till I hear what price

many of my heresies ; but if, on the whole, you and two or
three others think I am on the right road, I shall not care
what the mob of naturalists think. The penultimate chapter,*
though I believe it includes the truth, will, I much fear, make
you savage. Do not act and say, like Macleay versus

My dear Lyell,  I have been reading over all your let-
ters consecutively, and I do not feel that I have thanked you
half enough for the extreme pleasure which they have given
me, and for their utility. I see in them evidence of fluctua-
tion in the degree of credence you give to the theory ; nor am
I at all surprised at this, for many and many fluctuations I
have undergone.
There is one point in your letter which I did not notice,
about the animals (and many plants) naturalised in Australia,
which you think could not endure without mans aid. I can-
not see how man does aid the feral cattle. But, letting that
pass, you seem to think, that because they suffer prodigious
destruction during droughts, they would all be destroyed. In
the " grandes secos " of La Plata, the indigenous animals, such
as the American deer, die by thousands, and suffer apparently
as much as the cattle. In parts of India, after a drought, it
takes ten or more years before the indigenous mammals get

up to their full number again. Your argument would, I think,,
apply to the aborigines as well as to the feral.
An animal or plant which becomes feral in one small ter-
ritory might be destroyed by climate, but I can hardly
believe so, when once feral over several large territories.
Again, I feel inclined to swear at climate : do not think me
impudent for attacking you about climate. You say you
doubt whether man could have existed under the Eocene
climate, but man can now withstand the climate of Esqui-
maux-land and West Equatorial Africa; and surely you do
not think the Eocene climate differed from the present
throughout all Europe, as much as the Arctic regions differ
from Equatorial Africa ?
With respect to organisms being created on the American
type in America, it might, I think, be said that they were
so created to prevent them being too well created, so as
to beat the aborigines ; but this seems to me, somehow, a
monstrous doctrine.
I have reflected a good deal on what you say on the neces-
sity of continued intervention of creative power. I cannot see
this necessity ; and its admission, I think, would make the
theory of Natural Selection valueless. Grant a simple Arche-
typal creature, like the Mud-fish or Lepidosiren, with the five
senses and some vestige of mind, and I believe natural selection
will account for the production of every vertebrate animal.
Farewell ; forgive me for indulging in this prose, and
believe me, with cordial thanks.

My dear Hooker,  I congratulate you on your  Intro-
duction  * being in fact finished. I am sure from what I read
of it (and deeply I shall be interested in reading it straight
through), that it must have cost you a prodigious amount of
labour and thought I shall like very much to see the sheet,
which you wish me to look at Now I am so completely a
gentleman, that I have sometimes a little difficulty to pass the
day ; but it is astonishing how idle a three weeks I have
passed. If it is any comfort to you, pray delude yourself by
saying that you intend  sticking to humdrum science. But
I believe it just as much as if a plant were to say that,  I have
been growing all my life, and, by Jove, I will stop growing.
You cannot help yourself ; you are not clever enough for that.
You could not even remain idle, as I have done, for three
weeks I What you say about Lyell pleases me exceedingly ;
I had not at all inferred from his letters that he had come so
much round. I remember thinking, above a year ago, that if
ever I lived to see Lyell, yourself, and Huxley come round,,
partly by my book, and partly by their own reflections, I
should feel that the subject is safe, and all the world might
rail, but that ultimately the theory of Natural Selection
(though, no doubt, imperfect in its present condition, and
embracing many errors) would prevail. Nothing will ever
convince me that three such men, with so much diversified.

knowledge, and so well accustomed to search for truth, could
err greatly. I have spoken of you here as a convert made
by me ; but I know well how much larger the share has been
of your own self-thought. I am intensely curious to hear
Huxleys opinion of my book. I fear my long discussion
on Classification will disgust him ; for it is much opposed
to what he once said to me.
But, how I am running on ! You see how idle I am ; but 1
have so enjoyed your letter that you must forgive me. With
respect to migration during the Glacial period : I think Lyell
quite comprehends, for he has given me a supporting fact.
But, perhaps, he unconsciously hates (do not say so to him)
the view, as slightly staggering him on his favourite theory of
all changes of climate being due to changes in the relative
position of land and water.

modifications which are useful to him ; so under nature any
slight modification which chances to arise, and is useful to any
creature, is selected or preserved in the struggle for life ; any
modification which is injurious is destroyed or rejected ; any
which is neither useful nor injurious will be left a fluctuating
clement When you contrast natural selection and  improve-
ment, you seem always to overlook (for I do not see how
you can deny) that every step in the natural selection of each
species implies improvement in that species in relation to its
conditions of life. No modification can be selected without
it be an improvement or advantage. Improvement implies,
I suppose, each form obtaining many parts or organs, all
excellently adapted for their functions. As each species is
improved, and as the number of forms will have increased, if
we look to the whole course of time, the organic condition of
life for other forms will become more complex, and there will
be a necessity for other forms to become improved, or they
will be exterminated ; and I can see no limit to this process
of improvement, without the intervention of any other and
direct principle of improvement. All this seems to me quite
compatible with certain forms fitted for simple conditions,
remaining unaltered, or being degraded.

CHAPTER V.
BY PROFESSOR HUXLEY.
ON THE RECEPTION OF THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES.
To the present generation, that is to say, the people a few
years on the hither and thither side of thirty, the name of
Charles Darwin stands alongside of those of Isaac Newton and
Michael Faraday ; and, like them, calls up the grand ideal of
a searcher after truth and interpreter of Nature. They think
of him who bore it as a rare combination of genius, industry,
and unswerving veracity, who earned his place among the
most famous men of the age by sheer native power, in the
teeth of a gale of popular prejudice, and uncheered by a
sign of favour or appreciation from the official fountains of
honour ; as one who, in spite of an acute sensitiveness to
praise and blame, and notwithstanding provocations which
might have excused any outbreak, kept himself clear of all
envy, hatred, and malice, nor dealt otherwise than fairly and
justly with the unfairness and injustice which was showered
upon him ; while, to the end of his days, he was ready to
listen with patience and respect to the most insignificant of
reasonable objectors.
And with respect to that theory of the origin of the forms of
life peopling our globe, with which Dan,vins name is bound up
as closely as that of Newton with the theory of gravitation,
nothing seems to be further from the mind of the present
generation than any attempt to smother it with ridicule or
to crush it by vehemence of denunciation.  The struggle for
N 2

existence," and " Natural selection, have become household
words and every-day conceptions. The reality and the im-
portance of the natural processes on which Darwin founds
his deductions are no more doubted than those of growth
and multiplication ; and, whether the full potency attributed
to them is admitted or not, no one doubts their vast and far-
reaching significance. Wherever the biological sciences are
studied, the  Origin of Species  lights the path of the in-
vestigator ; wherever they are taught it permeates the course
of instruction. Nor has the influence of Darwinian ideas
been less profound, beyond the realms of Biology. The
oldest of all philosophies, that of Evolution, was bound hand
and foot and cast into utter darkness during the millennium
of theological scholasticism. But Darwin poured new life-
blood into the ancient frame ; the bonds burst, and the
revivified thought of ancient Greece has proved itself to be
a more adequate expression of the universal order of things
than any of the schemes which have been accepted by the
credulity and welcomed by the superstition of seventy later
generations of men.
To any one who studies the signs of the times, the
emergence of the philosophy of Evolution, in the attitude of
claimant to the throne of the world of thought, from the
limbo of hated and, as many hoped, forgotten things, is the
most portentous event of the nineteenth century. But the
most effective weapons of the modem champions of Evolution
were fabricated by Darwin ; and the  Origin of Species ' has
enlisted a formidable body of combatants, trained in the se-
vere school of Physical Science, whose ears might have long
remained deaf to the speculations of a priori philosophers.
I do not think that any candid or instructed person will
deny the truth of that which has just been asserted. He may
hate the very name of Evolution, and may deny its pretensions
as vehemently as a Jacobite denied those of George the Second.
But there it is  not only as solidly seated as the Hanoverian
 ORIGIN OF SPECIES.
l8l
dynasty, but happily independent of Parliamentary sanction
and the dullest antagonists have come to see that they have
to deal with an adversary whose bones are to be broken by
no amount of bad words.
Even the theologians have almost ceased to pit the plain
meaning of Genesis against the no less plain meaning of
Nature. Their more candid, or more cautious, representatives
have given up dealing with Evolution as if it were a damnable
heresy, and have taken refuge in one of two courses. Either
they deny that Genesis was meant to teach scientific truth,
and thus save the veracity of the record at the expense of its
authority ; or they expend their energies in devising the cruel
ingenuities of the reconciler, and torture texts in the vain
hope of making them confess the creed of Science. But when
the peine forte et dure is over, the antique sincerity of the vener-
able sufferer always reasserts itself. Genesis is honest to the
core, and professes to be no more than it is, a repository of
venerable traditions of unknown origin, claiming no scientific
authority and possessing none.
As my pen finishes these passages, I can but be
amused to think what a terrible hubbub would have been
made (in truth was made) about any similar expressions of
opinion a quarter of a century ago. In fact, the contrast
between the present condition of public opinion upon the
Darwinian question ; between the estimation in which
Darwins views are now held in the scientific world ; between
the acquiescence, or at least quiescence, of the theologians of
the self-respecting order at the present day and the out-
burst of antagonism on all sides in 1858-9, when the new
theory respecting the origin of species first became known to
the older generation to which I belong, is so startling that,
except for documentary evidence, I should be sometimes
inclined to think my memories dreams. I have a great
respect for the younger generation myself (they can write our
lives, and ravel out all our follies, if they choose to take the

trouble, by and by), and I should be glad to be assured that
the feeling is reciprocal ; but I am afraid that the story of our
dealings with Darwin may prove a great hindrance to that
veneration for our wisdom which 1 should like them to dis-
play. We have not even the excuse that, thirty years ago,
Mr. Danvin was an obscure novice, who had no claims on our
attention. On the contrary, his remarkable zoological and
geological investigations had long given him an assured posi-
tion among the most eminent and original investigators of
the day ; while his charming  Voyage of a Naturalist  had
justly earned him a wide-spread reputation among the general
public. I doubt if there was any man then living who had a
better right to expect that anything he might choose to say
on such a question as the Origin of Species would be listened
to with profound attention, and discussed w'ith respect ; and
there was certainly no man whose personal character should
have afforded a better safeguard against attacks, instinct with
malignity and spiced with shameless impertinences.
Yet such was the portion of one of the kindest and truest
men that it was ever my good fortune to know ; and years
had to pass away before misrepresentation, ridicule, and
denunciation, ceased to be the most notable constituents of
the majority of the multitudinous criticisms of his work which
poured from the press. I am loth to rake any of these ancient
scandals from their well-deserved oblivion ; but I must make
good a statement which may seem overcharged to the present
generation, and there is no pike justificative more apt for the
purpose, or more worthy of such dishonour, than the articie in
the  Quarterly Review  for July i860." Since Lord Brougham
THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES. 1 83
assailed Dr. Young, the world has seen no such specimen of
the insolence of a shallow pretender to a Master in Science as
this remarkable production, in which one of the most exact
of observers, most cautious of rcasoners, and most candid of
expositors, of this or any other age, is held up to scorn
as a  flighty " person, who endeavours  to prop up his utterly
rotten fabric of guess and speculation, and whose  mode of
dealing with nature  is reprobated as  utterly dishonourable
to Natural Science. And all this high and mighty talk, which
would have been indecent in one of Mr. Darwins equals,
proceeds from a writer whose want of intelligence, or of con-
science, or of both, is so great, that, by way of an objection to
Mr. Darwins views, he can ask,  Is it credible that all favour-
able varieties of turnips are tending to become men ;  who is
so ignorant of paleontology, that he can talk of the  flowers
and fruits  of the plants of the carboniferous epoch ; of com-
parative anatomy, that he can gravely affirm the poison appa-
ratus of the venomous snakes to be  entirely separate from
the ordinary laws of animal life, and peculiar to themselves
of the rudiments of physiology, that he can ask,  what
advantage of life could alter the shape of the corpuscles into
which the blood can be evaporated ?  Nor does the reviewer
fail to flavour this outpouring of preposterous incapacity with
a little stimulation of the odium tlmlogicum. Some inkling
of the history of the conflicts between Astronomy, Geology,
and Theology, leads him to keep a retreat open by the
proviso that he cannot consent to test the truth of Natural
Science by the word of Revelation ;  but, for all that, he
devotes pages to the exposition of his conviction that Mr.
Darwins theory contradicts the revealed relation of the
creation to its Creator, and is  inconsistent with the fulness
of his glory.
If I confine my retrospect of the reception of the  Origin
of Species  to a twelvemonth, or thereabouts, from the time
of its publication, I do not recollect anything quite so foolish
and unmannerly as the Quarterly Review article, unless,
perhaps, the address of a Reverend Professor to the Dublin
Geological Society might enter into competition with it But
a large proportion of Mr. Darwins critics had a lamentable
resemblance to the Quarterly reviewer, in so far as they
lacked either the will, or the wit, to make themselves masters
of his doctrine ; hardly any possessed the knowledge required
to follow him through the immense range of biological and
geological science which the  Origin  covered ; while, too
commonly, they had prejudged the case on theological
grounds, and, as seems to be inevitable when this happens,
eked out lack of reason by superfluity of railing.
But it will be more pleasant and more profitable to consider
those criticisms, which were acknowledged by writers of
scientific authority, or which bore internal evidence of the
greater or less competency and, often, of the good faith, of
their authors. Restricting my survey to a twelvemonth, or
thereabouts, after the publication of the  Origin, I find
among such critics Louis Agassiz;* Murray, an excellent
entomologist ; Harvey, a botanist of considerable repute ;
and the author of an article in the * Edinburgh Review, all
strongly adverse to Darwin. Pictet, the distinguished and
widely learned paleontologist of Geneva, treats Mr. Darwin
with a respect which forms a grateful contrast to the tone of

only a very little way.* On the other hand, Lyell, up to
that time a pillar of the anti-transmutationists (who regarded
him, ever afterwards, as Pallas Athene may have looked
at Dian, after the Endymion affair), declared himself a
Danvinian, though not without putting in a serious caveat.
Nevertheless, he was a tower of strength, and his courageous
stand for truth as against consistency, did him infinite
honour. As evolutionists, sans phrase, I do not call to mind
among the biologists more than Asa Gray, who fought the
battle splendidly in the United States ; Hooker, who was no
less vigorous here ; the present Sir John Lubbock and my-
self. Wallace was far away in the Malay Archipelago ; but,
apart' from his direct share in the promulgation of the
theory of natural selection, no enumeration of the influences
at work, at the time I am speaking of, would be com-
plete without the mention of his powerful essay  On the
Law which has regulated the Introduction of New Species,'
which was published in 1855. On reading it afresh, I have
been astonished to recollect how small was the impression
it made.

long time the effect of a conspiracy of silence ; and many
years passed before the Academy redeemed itself from the
reproach that the name of Darwin was not to be found on the
list of its members. However, an accomplished writer, out of
the range of academical influences, M. Laugel, gave an excel-
lent and appreciative notice of the Origin in the Revue
des Deux Mondes. Germany took time to consider ; Bronn
produced a slightly Bowdlerized translation of the  Origin  ;
and  Kladderadatsch  cut his jokes upon the ape origin of
man ; but I do not call to mind that any scientific notability
declared himself publicly in i86o.* None of us dreamed that,
in the course of a few years, the strength (and perhaps I may add
the weakness) of  Darwinismus  would have its most exten-
sive and most brilliant illustrations in the land of learning.
If a foreigner may presume to speculate on the cause of this
curious interval of silence, I fancy it was that one moiety of
the German biologists were orthodox at any price, and the
other moiety as distinctly heterodox. The latter were evo-
lutionists, a priori, already, and they must have felt the dis-
gust natural to deductive philosophers at being offered an
inductive and experimental foundation for a conviction which
they had reached by a shorter cut It is undoubtedly trying

in 1 860 were numerically extremely insignificant. There is not
the slightest doubt that, if a general council of the Church

doubt that if such a council gathered now, the decree would

of sense, as well as of modesty, to ascribe to the men of that
generation less capacity or less honesty than their successors
possess. What, then, are the causes which led instructed and
fair-judging men of that day to arrive at a judgment so
different from that which seems just and fair to those who
follow them ? That is really one of the most interesting of all
questions connected with the history of science, and I shall
try to answer it. I am afraid that in order to do so I must
run the risk of appearing egotistical. However, if I tell my
own story it is only because I know it better than that of
other people.
I think I must have read the  Vestiges  before I left Eng-
land in 1846 ; but, if I did, the book made very little impres-
sion upon me, and I was not brought into serious contact with
the Species question until after 1850. At that time, I had
long done with the Pentateuchal cosmogony, which had been
impressed upon my childish understanding as Divine truth,
with all the authority of parents and instructors, and from
which it had cost me many a struggle to get free. But my
mind was unbiassed in respect of any doctrine which presented
itself, if it professed to be based on purely philosophical and
scientific reasoning. It seemed to me then (as it does now)
that  creation, in the ordinary sense of the word, is perfectly
conceivable. I find no difficulty in imagining that, at some
former period, this universe was not in existence ; and that
it made its appearance in six days (or instantaneously, if
that is preferred), in consequence of the volition of some pre-
existent Being. Then, as now, the so-called a priori argu-
ments against Theism, and, given a Deity, against the
possibility of creative acts, appeared to me to be devoid of
reasonable foundation. I had not then, and I have not now,
the smallest a priori objection to raise to the account of the
creation of animals and plants given in  Paradise Lost, in
which Milton so vividly embodies the natural sense of Genesis.
Far be it from me to say that it is untrue because it is impos-

sible. I confine myself to what must be regarded as a modest
and reasonable request for some particle of evidence that the
existing species of animals and plants did originate in that
way, as a condition of my belief in a statement which appears
to me to be highly improbable.
And, by way of being perfectly fair, I had exactly the
same answer to give to the evolutionists of 1851-8. Within
the ranks of the biologists, at that time, I met with nobody,
except Dr. Grant, of University College, who had a word to say
for Evolution  and his advocacy was not calculated to advance
the cause. Outside these ranks, the only person known to me
whose knowledge and capacity compelled respect, and who
was, at the same time, a thorough-going evolutionist, was Mr.
Herbert Spencer, whose acquaintance I made, I think, in
1852, and then entered into the bonds of a friendship which,
I am happy to think, has known no interruption. Many and
prolonged were the battles we fought on this topic. But
even my friends rare dialectic skill and copiousness of
apt illustration could not drive me from my agnostic position.
I took my stand upon two grounds : firstly, that up to that
time, the evidence in favour of transmutation was wholly
insufficient; and, secondly, that no suggestion respecting
the causes of the transmutation assumed, which had been
made, was in any way adequate to explain the phenomena.
Looking back at the state of knowledge at that time, I
really do not see that any other conclusion was justifiable.
In those days I had never even heard of Treviranus
 Biologic. However, I had studied Lamarck attentively and
I had read the  Vestiges  with due care ; but neither of them
afforded me any good ground for changing my negative
and critical attitude. As for the  Vestiges, I confess that
the book simply irritated me by the prodigious ignorance
and thoroughly unscientific habit of mind manifested by the
writer. If it had any influence on me at all, it set me
against Evolution ; and the only review I ever have qualms
THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES.
of conscience about, on the ground of needless savagery, is
one I wrote on the  Vestiges  while under that influence.
With respect to the Philosophie Zoologique, it is no
reproach to Lamarck to say that the discussion of the Species
question in that work, whatever might be said for it in 1809,
was miserably below the level of the knowledge of half a
century later. In that interval of time the elucidation of
the structure of the lower animals and plants had given rise
to wholly new conceptions of their relations ; histology and
embryology, in the modern sense, had been created ; physio-
logy had been reconstituted ; the facts of distribution,
geological and geographical, had been prodigiously multi-
plied and reduced to order. To any biologist whose studies
had carried him beyond mere species-mongering in 1850, one-
half of Lamarcks arguments were obsolete and the other
half erroneous, or defective, in virtue of omitting to deal with
the various classes of evidence which had been brought to
light since his time. Moreover his one suggestion as to the
cause of the gradual modifleation of species  effort excited
by change of conditions  was, on the face of it, inapplicable to
the whole vegetable world. I do not think that any impartial
judge who reads the  Philosophie Zoologique  now, and who
aftenvards takes up Lyells trenchant and effectual criticism
(published as far back as 1830), will be disposed to allot
to Lamarck a much higher place in the establishment of
biological evolution than that which Bacon assigns to himself
in relation to physical science generally ,  buccinator tautum.'
But, by a curious irony of fate, the same influence which
led me to put as little faith in modem speculations on this
subject, as in the venerable traditions recorded in the first two
chapters of Genesis, was perhaps more potent than any other

in keeping alive a sort of pious conviction that Evolution,
after all, would turn out true. I have recently read afresh
the first edition of the Principles of Geology ; and when I
consider that this remarkable book had been nearly thirty
years in everybodys hands, and that it brings home to any
reader of ordinary intelligence a great principle and a great
fact  the principle, that the past must be explained by the
present, unless good cause be shown to the contrary ; and the
fact, that, so far as our knowledge of the past history of life
on our globe goes, no such cause can be shown *  I cannot
but believe that Lycll, for others, as for myself, was the chief
agent in smoothing the road for Danvin. For consistent
uniformitarianism postulates evolution as much in the organic
as in the inorganic world. The origin of a new species by
other than ordinary agencies would be a vastly greater
 catastrophe  than any of those which Lyell successfully
eliminated from sober geological speculation.
In fact, no one was better aware of this than Lyell himselff

THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES.
I9I
on the one hand, and to the ideal quasi-progressionism of
Agassiz, on the other, Lyell, in his own mind, was strongly-
disposed to account for the origination of all past and present
species of living things by natural causes. But he would have
liked, at the same time, to keep the name of creation for a
natural process which he imagined to be incomprehensible.
CTTXTHR In a letter addressed to Mantell (dated March 2, 1827),
Lyell speaks of having just read Lamarck ; he expresses his
delight at Lamarcks theories, and his personal freedom from
any objections based on theological grounds. And though he
is evidently alarmed at the pithecoid origin of man involved
in Lamarcks doctrine, he observes :
 But, after all, what changes species may really undergo !
How impossible will it bo to distinguish and lay down a line,
beyond which some of the so-called extinct species have
never passed into recent ones.
Again, the following remarkable passage occurs in the post-
script of a letter addressed to Sir John Herschel in 1836:
In regard to the origination of new species, I am very
glad to find that you think it probable that it may be carried
on through the intervention of intermediate causes. I left this
rather to be inferred, not thinking it worth while to- offend a
certain class of persons by embodying in words what would
only be a speculation. * He goes on to refer to the criticisms
which have been directed against him on the ground that, by
leaving species to be originated by miracle, he is inconsistent
with his own doctrine of uniformitarianism ; and he leaves it

to Whewell, March 7, 1837, vol. ii.,

and vegetable species to another] . . ,
you remember what Herschel said
in his letter to me. If 1 had stated
as plainly as he has done the possi-
bility of the introduction or origina-
tion of fresh species being a natural,
in contradistinction to a miraculous
process, I should have raised a host
of prejudices against me, which are
unfortunately opposed at every step
to any philosopher who attempts to

terious subjects. Sec also letter to

to be understood that he had not replied, on the ground of his
general objection to controversy.
Lyells contemporaries were not without some inkling of
his esoteric doctrine. Whewells  History of the Inductive
Sciences, whatever its philosophical value, is always worth
reading and always interesting, if under no other aspect than
that of an evidence of the speculative limits within which a
highly-placed divine might, at that time, safely range at
will. In the course of his discussion of uniformitarianism, the
encyclopaedic Master of Trinity observes :
" Mr. Lyell, indeed, has spoken of an hypothesis that  the
successive creation of species may constitute a regular part of
the economy of nature, but he has nowhere, I think, so
described this process as to make it appear in what depart-
ment of science we are to place the hypothesis. Are these
new species created by the production, at long intervals, of
an offspring different in species from the parents ? Or are
the species so created produced without parents ? Are they
gradually evolved from some embryo substance Or do they
suddenly start from the ground, as in the creation of the
poet? . . .
 Some selection of one of these forms of the hypothesis,
rather than the others, with evidence for the selection, is
requisite to entitle us to place it among the known causes of
change, which in this chapter we are considering. The bare
conviction that a creation of species has taken place, whether
once or many times, so long as it is unconnected with our
organical sciences, is a tenet of Natural Theology ratlier
than of Physical Philosophy. *
The earlier part of this criticism appears perfectly just and
appropriate ; but, from the concluding paragraph, Whewell
evidently imagines that by  creation  Lyell means a preter-
natural intervention of the Deity ; whereas the letter to
Herschel shows that, in his own mind, Lyell meant natural

causation ; and I see no reason to doubt * that, if Sir Charles
could have avoided the inevitable corollary of the pithecoid
origin of man  for which, to the end of his life, he entertained
a profound antipathy  ^he would have advocated the efficiency
of causes now in operation to bring about the condition of the
organic world, as stoutly as he championed that doctrine in
reference to inorganic nature.
The fact is, that a discerning eye might have seen that
some form or other of the doctrine of transmutation was
inevitable, from the time when the truth enunciated by William
194
OX THE RECEPTION OF
Smith, that successive strata are characterised by different
kinds of fossil remains, became a firmly established law of
nature. No one has set forth the speculative consequences
of this generalisation better than the historian of the  Induc-
tive Sciences  :
But the study of geology opens to us the spectacle of
many groups of species which have, in the course of the earths
history, succeeded each other at vast intervals of time ; one
set of animals and plants disappearing, as it would seem,
from the face of our planet, and others, which did not before
exist, becoming the only occupants of the globe. And the
dilemma then presents itself to us anew either we must
accept the doctrine of the transmutation of species, and must
suppose that the organized species of one geological epoch
were transmuted into those of another by some long-con-
tinued agency of natural causes ; or else, we must believe in
many successive acts of creation and extinction of species,
out of the common course of nature ; acts which, therefore,
we may properly call miraculous.
Dr. Whewell decides in favour of the latter conclusion. And
if any one had plied him with the four questions which he
puts to Lyell in the passage already cited, all that can be said
now is that he would certainly have rejected the first But
would he really have had the courage to say that a Rhinoceros
iichorhinus, for instance,  was produced without parents ;  or
was evolved from some embryo substance; or that it
suddenly started from the ground like Miltons lion pawing
to get free his hinder parts? I permit myself to doubt
whether even the Master of Trinitys well-tried courage
physical, intellectual, and moral  would have been equal to
this feat. No doubt the sudden concurrence of half-a-ton of
inorganic molecules into a live rhinoceros is conceivable, and
therefore may be possible. But does such an event lie

sufficiently within the bounds of probability to justify the
belief in its occurrence on the strength of any attainable, or,
indeed, imaginable, evidence ?
In view of the assertion (often repeated in the early days
of the opposition to Darwin) that he had added nothing to
Lamarck, it is very interesting to observe that the possibility
of a fifth alternative, in addition to the four he has stated, has
not dawned upon Dr. Whewells mind. The suggestion that
new species may result from the selective action of external
conditions upon the variations from their specific type which
individuals present  and which we call spontaneous," because
we are ignorant of their causation  is as wholly unknown to
the historian of scientific ideas as it was to biological spe-
cialists before 1858. But that suggestion is the central idea
of the  Origin of Species, and contains the quintessence of
Darwinism.
Thus, looking back into the past, it seems to me that my
o^vn position of critical expectancy was Just and reasonable,
and must have been taken up, on the same grounds, by many
other persons. If Agassiz told me that the forms of life
which had successively tenanted the globe were the incarna-
tions of successive thoughts of the Deity ; and that He had
wiped out one set of these embodiments by an appalling
geological catastrophe as soon as His ideas took a more
advanced shape, I found myself not only unable to admit the
accuracy of the deductions from the facts of paleontology,
upon which this astounding hypothesis was founded, but I
had to confess my want of any means of testing the correctness
of his explanation^of them. And besides that, I could by no
means see what the explanation e.xplained. Neither did it
help me to be told [by an eminent anatomist that species had
succeeded one another in time, in virtue of  a continuously
operative creational law. That seemed to me to be no more
than saying that species had succeeded one another, in the
form of a vote-catching resolution, with "law to please the

man of science, and  creational  to draw the orthodox. So
I took refuge in that  thiitige Skepsis  which Goethe has so
well defined ; and, reversing the apostolic precept to be all
things to all men, I usually defended the tenability of the
received doctrines, when I had to do with the transmuta-
tionists ; and stood up for the possibility of transmutation
among the orthodox  thereby, no doubt, increasing an already
current, but quite undeserved, reputation for needless com-
bativeness.
I remember, in the course of my first interview with
Mr. Darwin, e.xpressing my belief in the sharpness of the lines
of demarcation between natural groups and in the absence
of transitional forms, with all the confidence of youth and
imperfect knowledge. I was not aware, at that time, that he
had then been many years brooding over the species-ques-
tion ; and the humorous smile which accompanied his gentle
answer, that such was not altogether his view, long haunted
and puzzled me. But it would seem that four or five years
hard work had enabled me to understand what it meant ;
for CTTXTHR Lyell,* writing to Sir Charles Bunbury (under date of
April 30, 1856), says;
 When Huxley, Hooker, and Wollaston were at Darwins
last week they (all four of them) ran a tilt against species
further, I believe, than they are prepared to go.
1 recollect nothing of this beyond the fact of meeting Mr.
Wollaston ; and except for Sir Charles distinct assurance
as to " all four, I should have thought my outrecuidance was
probably a counterblast to Wollastons conservatism. With
regard to Hooker, he was already, like Voltaires Habakkuk,
"capable de tout" in the way of advocating Evolution.
As I have already said, I imagine that most of those of my
contemporaries who thought seriously about the matter, were
very much in my own state of mind  inclined to say to
both Mosaists and Evolutionists,  a plague on both your

houses !  and disposed to turn aside from an interminable and
apparently fruitless discussion, to labour in the fertile fields
of ascertainable fact. And I may, therefore, further suppose
that the publication of the Darwin and Wallace papers in
1858, and still more that of the  Origin  in 1859, had tlie
effect upon them of the flash of light, which to a man who
has lost himself in a dark night, suddenly reveals a road
which, whether it takes him straight home or not, certainly
goes his way. That which we were looking for, and could
not find, was a hypothesis respecting the origin of known
oiganic forms, which assumed the operation of no causes but
such as could be proved to be actually at work. We wanted,
not to pin our faith to that or any other speculation, but to
get hold of clear and definite conceptions which could be
brought face to face with facts and have their validity tested.
The Origin provided us with the working hypothesis we
sought. Moreover, it did the immense service of freeing
us for ever from the dilemma  refuse to accept the creation
hypothesis, and what have you to propose that can be accepted
by any cautious reasoncr? In 1857, I had no answer ready,
and I do not think that any one else had. A year later, we
reproached ourselves with dulness for being perplexed by
.such an inquiry. My reflection, when I first made myself
master of the central idea of the  Origin, was,  How ex-
tremely stupid not to have thought of that ! " I suppose that
Columbus companions said much the same when he made
the egg stand on end. The facts of variability, of the struggle
for existence, of adaptation to conditions, were notorious
enough ; but none of us had suspected that the road to the
heart of the species problem lay through them, until Darwin
and Wallace dispelled the darkness, and the beacon-fire of
the  Origin  guided the benighted.
Whether the particular shape which the doctrine of evolu-
tion, as applied to the organic world, took in Darwins hands,
would prove to be final or not, was, to me, a matter of indifier-
ON THE RECEPTION OF

ence. In my earliest criticisms of the  Origin  I ventured to-
point out that its logical foundation was insecure so long as.
experiments in selective breeding had not produced varieties
which were more or less infertile ; and that insecurity remains
up to the present time. But, with any and every critical doubt
which my sceptical ingenuity could suggest, the Darwinian
hypothesis remained incomparably more probable than the
creation hypothesis. And if we had none of us been able ta
discern the paramount significance of some of the most patent
and notorious of natural facts, until they were, so to speak,
thrust under our noses, what force remained in the dilemma
creation or nothing? It was obvious that, hereafter, the
probability would be immensely greater, that the links of
natural causation were hidden from our purblind eyes, than
that natural causation should be incompetent to produce ail
the phenomena of nature. The only rational course for those
who had no other object than the attainment of truth, was to
accept  Darwinism  as a working hypothesis, and see what
could be made of it Either it would prove its capacity to
elucidate the facts of organic life, or it would break down under
the strain. This was surely the dictate of common sense
and, for once, common sense carried the day. The result has
been that complete volte-face of the whole scientific world,
which must seem so surprising to the present generation. I
do not mean to say that all the leaders of biological science
have avowed themselves Dar^vinians ; but I do not think
that there is a single zoologist, or botanist, or palmontologist,
among the multitude of active workers of this generation,
who is other than an evolutionist, profoundly influenced by
Danvins views. Whatever may be the ultimate fate of the
particular theory put forth by Danvin, I venture to affirm that,,
so far as my knowledge goes, all the ingenuity and all the
learning of hostile critics has not enabled them to adduce a
solitary fact, of which it can be said, this is irreconcilable with
the Darwinian theory. In the prodigious variety and com-

plexity of organic nature, there arc multitudes of phenomena
which are not deduciblc from any generalisations we have yet
reached. But the same may be said of every other class of
natural objects. I believe that astronomers cannot yet get
the moons motions into perfect accordance with the theory
of gravitation.
It would be inappropriate, even if it were possible, to dis-
cuss the difficulties and unresolved problems which have
hitherto met the evolutionist, and which will probably continue
to puzzle him for many generations to come, in the course of
this brief history of the reception of Mr. Darwins great work.
But there are two or three objections of a more general
character, based, or supposed to be based, upon philosophical
and theological foundations, which were loudly expressed in
the early days of the Darwinian controversy, and which,
though they have been answered over and over again, crop
up now and then at the present day.
The most singular of these, perhaps immortal, fallacies,
which live bn, Tithonus-like, when sense and force have long
deserted them, is that which charges Mr. Darwin with having
attempted to reinstate the old pagan goddess. Chance. It is
said that he supposes variations to come about  by chance,
and that the fittest survive the  chances  of the struggle for
existence, and thus chance is substituted for providential
design.
It is not a little wonderful that such an accusation as this
should be brought against a writer who has, over and over
again, warned his readers that when he uses the word  spon-
taneous, he merely means that he is ignorant of the cause of
that which is so termed ; and whose whole theory crumbles
to pieces if the uniformity and regularity of natural causation
for illimitable past ages is denied. But prnbiiMy tlir lunl
answer to those who talk of Darwinism mciatlngltlic

"chance. Do they believe that anything in this universe
happens without reason or without a cause ? Do they really
conceive that any event has no cause, and could not have
been predicted by any one who had a sufficient insight into
the order of Nature? If they do, it is they who are the
inheritors of antique superstition and ignorance, and whose
minds have never been illumined by a ray of scientific
thought The one act of faith in the convert to science, is
the confession of the universality of order and of the absolute
validity, in all times and under all circumstances, of the law
of causation. This confession is an act of faith, because,
by the nature of the case, the truth of such propositions is
not susceptible of proof. But such faith is not blind, but
reasonable ; because it is invariably confirmed by experi-
ence, and constitutes the sole trustworthy foundation for all
If one of these people, in whom the chance-worship of our
remoter ancestors thus strangely survives, should be within
reach of the sea when a heavy gale is blowing, let him betake
himself to the shore and watch the scene. Let him note the
infinite variety of form and size of the tossing waves out at
sea ; or of the curves of their foam-crested breakers, as they
dash against the rocks ; let him listen to the roar and scream
of the shingle as it is cast up and torn down the beach ; or
look at the flakes of foam as they drive hither and thither
before the wind ; or note the play of colours, which answers
a gleam of sunshine as it falls upon their myriad bubbles.
Surely here, if anywhere, he will say that chance is supreme,
and bend the knee as one who has entered the very penetralia
of his divinity. But the man of science knows that here, as
everywhere, perfect order is manifested ; that there is not a
curve of the waves, not a note in the howling chorus, not a
rainbow-glint on a bubble, which is other than a necessary
consequence of the ascertained laws of nature ; and that with
a sufficient knowledge of the conditions, competent physico-

mathematical skill could account for, and indeed predict,
every one of these  chance  events.
A second very common objection to Mr. Darwins views
was (and is), that they abolish Teleology, and eviscerate the
argument from design. It is nearly twenty years since I
ventured to offer some remarks on this subject, and as my
arguments have as yet received no refutation, 1 hope I may
be excused for reproducing them. I observed,  that the doc-
trine of Evolution is the most formidable opponent of all the
commoner and coarser forms of Teleology. But perhaps the
most remarkable service to the philosophy of Biology ren-
dered by Mr. Darwin is the reconciliation of Teleology and
Morphology, and the explanation of the facts of both, which
his views offer. The teleology which supposes that the eye,
such as we see it in man, or one of the higher vertebrata, was
made with the precise structure it exhibits, for the purpose of
enabling the animal which possesses it to see, has undoubtedly
received its death-blow. Nevertheless, it is necessary to re-
member that there is a wider teleology which is not touched
by the doctrine of Evolution, but is actually based upon the
fundamental proposition of Evolution. This proposition is
that the whole world, living and not living, is the result of the
mutual interaction, according to definite laws, of the forces
possessed by the molecules of which the primitive nebulosity
of the universe was composed. If this be true, it is no less
certain that the existing world lay potentially in the cosmic
vapour, and that a sufficient intelligence could, from a know-
ledge of the properties of the molecules of that vapour, have
predicted, say the state of the fauna of Britain in 1869, with
as much certainty as one can say what will happen to the
vapour of the breath on a cold winter's day. ....
.... The teleological and the mechanical views of nature
arc not, necessarily, mutually exclusive. On the contrary, the
more purely a mechanist the speculator is, the more firmly
 I should now like to substitute the word powers for  forces.

does he assume a primordial molecular arrangement of which
all the phenomena of the universe arc the consequences,,
and the more completely is he thereby at the mercy of the
telcologist, who can always defy him to disprove that this
primordial molecular arrangement was not intended to evolve
the phenomena of the universe.
The acute champion of Teleology, Paley, saw no difficulty
in admitting that the production of things may be the
result of trains of mechanical dispositions fixed beforehand
by intelligent appointment and kept in action by a power at
the centre, t that is to say, he proleptically accepted the modem
doctrine of Evolution ; and his successors might do well to
follow their leader, or at any rate to attend to his weighty
reasonings, before rushing into an antagonism which has no
reasonable foundation.
Having got rid of the belief in chance and the disbelief in
design, as in no sense appurtenances of Evolution, tire third
libel upon that doctrine, that it is anti-theistic, might perhaps
be left to shift for itself. But the persistence with which
many people refuse to draw the plainest consequences from
the propositions they profess to accept, renders it advisable
to remark that the doctrine of Evolution is neither Anti-
theistic nor Theistic. It simply has no more to do with Theism
than the first book of Euclid has. It is quite certain that a
normal fresh-laid egg contains neither cock nor hen ; and it
is also as certain as any proposition in physics or morals, that
if such an egg is kept under proper conditions for three
weeks, a cock or hen chicken will be found in it It is also
quite certain that if the shell were transparent we should be
able to watch the formation of the young fowl, day by day,,
by a process of evolution, from a microscopic cellular germ
to its full size and complication of structure. Therefore

Evolution, in the strictest sense, is actually going on in this
and analogous millions and millions of instances, wherever
living creatures exist. Therefore, to borrow an argument
from Butler, as that which now happens must be consistent
with the attributes of the Deity, if such a Being exists.
Evolution must be consistent with those attributes. And, if
so, the evolution of the universe, which is neither more nor less
explicable than that of a chicken, must also be consistent
with them. The doctrine of Evolution, therefore, does not
even come into contact with Theism, considered as a philo-
sophical doctrine. That with which it does collide, and with
which it is absolutely inconsistent, is the conception of
creation, which theological speculators have based upon the
history narrated in the opening of the book of Genesis.
There is a greal deal of talk and not a little lamentation
about the so-called religious difHcuIties which physical science
has created. In theological science, as a matter of fact, it
has created none. Not a solitary problem presents itself to
the philosophical Theist, at the present day, which has not
existed from the time that philosophers began to think out
the logical grounds and the logical consequences of Theism.
All the real or imaginary perplexities which flow from the
conception of the universe as a determinate mechanism, are
equally involved in the assumption of an Eternal, Omnipotent
and Omniscient Deity. The theological equivalent of the
scientific conception of order is Providence ; and the doctrine
of determinism follows as surely from the attributes of fore-
knowledge assumed by the theologian, as from the universality
of natural causation assumed by the man of science. The
angels in * Paradise Lost  would have found the task of en-
lightening Adam upon the mysteries of  Fate, Foreknow-
ledge, and Free-will, not a whit more difficult, if their pupil
had been educated in a " Real-schule  and trained in every
laboratory of a modem university. In respect of the great
problems of Philosophy, the post-Darwinian generation is.

in one sense, exactly where the prae-Darwinian generations
were. They remain insoluble. But the present generation
has the advantage of being better provided with the means
of freeing itself from the tyranny of certain sham solutions.
The known is finite, the unknown infinite ; intellectually
we stand on an islet in the midst of an illimitable ocean
of inexplicability. Our business in every generation is to
reclaim a little more land, to add something to the extent
and the solidity of our possessions. And even a cursory
glance at the history of the biological sciences during the
last quarter of a century is sufficient to justify the assertion,
that the most potent instrument for the extension of the
realm of natural knowledge which has come into mens hands,
since the publication of Newtons Principia, is Danvin's
 Origin of Species.
It was badly received by the generation to which it was
first addressed, and the outpouring of angry nonsense to which
it gave rise is sad to think upon. But the present generation
will probably behave just as badly if another Danvin should
arise, and inflict upon them that which the generality of man-
kind most hate  the necessity of revising their convictions.
Let them, then, be charitable to us ancients ; and if they
behave no better than the men of my day to some new
benefactor, let them recollect that, after all, our wrath did not
come to much, and vented itself chiefly in the bad language
of sanctimonious scolds. Let them as speedily perform a
strategic right-about-face, and follow the truth wherever it
leads. The opponents of the new truth will discover, as those
of Darwin are doing, that, after all, theories do not alter facts,
and that the universe remains unaffected even though texts
crumble. Or, it may be, that, as history repeats itself, their
happy ingenuity will also discover that the new wine is
exactly of the same vintage as the old, and that (rightly
viewed) the old bottles prove to have been expressly made
for holding it.

persuade you to publish it without waiting for a time which
probably could never have arrived, though you lived till the
age of a hundred, when you had prepared all your facts on
which you ground so many grand generalizations.
It is a splendid case of close reasoning, and long substan-
tial argument throughout so many pages ; the condensation
immense, too great perhaps for the uninitiated, but an effective
and important preliminary statement, which will admit, even
before your detailed proofs appear, of some occasional useful
exemplification, such as your pigeons and cirripedes, of which
you make such excellent use.
I mean that, when, as I fully expect, a new edition is soon
called for, you may here and there insert an actual case to
relieve the vast number of abstract propositions. So far as
I am concerned, I am so well prepared to take your state-
ments of facts for granted, that I do not think the "pieces
justificatives  when published will make much difference, and
1 have long seen most clearly that if any concession is made,
all that you claim in your concluding pages will follow. It
is this which has made me so long hesitate, always feeling
that the case of Man and his races, and of other animals, and
that of plants is one and the same, and that if a  vera causa
be admitted for one, instead of a purely unknown and imagin-
ary one, such as the word  Creation, all the consequences
must follow.
I fear I have not time to-day, as I am just leaving this
place, to indulge in a variety of comments, and to say how
much I was delighted with Oceanic Islands  Rudimentary
Organs  Embryology  the genealogical key to the Natural
System, Geographical Distribution, and if I went on I should
be copying the heads of all your chapters. But I will say a
word of tlie Recapitulation, in case some slight alteration,
or, at least, omission of a word or two be still possible in
that.
In the first place, at p. 480, it cannot surely be said that

the most eminent naturalists have rejected the view of the
mutability of species ? You do not mean to ignore G. St
Hilaire and Lamarck. As to the latter, you may say, that in
regard to animals you substitute natural selection for volition
to a certain considerable extent, but in his theory of the
changes of plants he could not introduce volition ; he may,
no doubt, have laid an undue comparative stress on changes
in physical conditions, and too little on those of contending
organisms. He at least was for the universal mutability of
species and for a genealogical link between the first and the
present. The men of his school also appealed to domestic-
ated varieties. (Do you mean living naturalists ?) *
The first page of this most important summary gives the
adversary an advantage, by putting forth so abruptly and
crudely such a startling objection as the formation of " the
eye, not by means analogous to mans reason, or rather by
some power immeasurably superior to human reason, but
by superinduced variation like those of which a cattle-breeder
avails himself. Pages would be required thus to state an
objection and remove it It would be better, as you wish to
persuade, to say nothing. Leave out several sentences, and
in a future edition bring it out more fully. Between the
throwing down of such a stumbling-block in the way of the
reader, and the passage to the working ants, in p. 460, there
are pages required ; and these ants are a bathos to him before
he has recovered from the shock of being called upon to
believe the eye to have been brought to perfection, from a
state of blindness or purblindness, by such variations as we
witness. I think a little omission would greatly lessen the
objectionableness of these sentences if you have not time to
recast and amplify.

excellent, as both are truly genealogical.
The want of peculiar birds in Madeira is a greater difficulty
than seemed to me allowed for. I could cite passages where
you show that variations are superinduced from the new cir-
cumstances of new colonists, which would require some
Madeira birds, like those of the Galapagos, to be peculiar.

My dear Lyell,  I thank you cordially for giving me so
much of your valuable time in writing me the long letter of

proof-sheet to Scarborough. I have adopted most thankfully
all your minor corrections in the last chapter, and the greater
ones as far as I could with little trouble. I damped the
opening passage about the eye (in my bigger work I show
the gradations in structure of the eye) by putting merely

Madeira and Bermuda Birds not peculiar.  You arc right,
there is a screw out here ; I thought no one would have
detected it; I blundered in omitting a discussion, which
I have written out in full. But once for all, let me say as an
excuse, that it was most difficult to decide what to omit.
Birds, which have struggled in their own homes, when settled
in a body, nearly simultaneously in a new country, would not
be subject to much modification, for their mutual relations
would not be much disturbed. But I quite agree with you,
that in time they ought to undergo some. In Bermuda and
Madeira they have, as I believe, been kept constant by the
frequent arrival, and the crossing with unaltered immigrants
of the same species from the main land. In Bermuda this
can be proved, in Madeira highly probable, as shown me by
letters from E. V. Harcourt. Moreover, there are ample ground,
for believing that the crossed offspring of the new immigrants
(fresh blood as breeders would say), and old colonists of the
same species would be extra vigorous, and would be the most
likely to survive ; thus the effects of such crossing in keeping
the old colonists unaltered would be much aided.
On Galapagos productions having American type on view
of Creation.  I cannot agree with you, that species if created
to struggle with American forms, would have to be created on
the American type. Facts point diametrically the other way.
Look at the unbroken and untilled ground in La Plata,
covered with European products, which have no near affinity
to the indigenous products. They are not American types
which conquer the aborigines. So in every island throughout
the world. Alph. De Candolles result (though he does not
see its full importance), that thoroughly well naturalised
(plants] are in general very different from the aborigines
(belonging in large proportion of cases to non-indigenous
genera) is most important always to bear in mind. Once
for all, I am sure, you will understand that I thus write
dogmatically for brevity sake.

On t]ie continued Creation of Monads.  This doctrine is
.superfluous (and groundless) on the theory of Natural Selec-
tion, which implies no necessary tendency to progression. A
monad, if no deviation in its structure profitable to it under
its excessively simple conditions of life occurred, might remain
unaltered from long before the Silurian Age to the present
day. I grant there will generally be a tendency to advance
in complexity of organisation, though in beings fitted for very
simple conditions it w'ould be slight and slow. How could
a complex organisation profit a monad ? if it did not profit
it there would be no advance. The Secondary Infusoria differ
but little from the living. The parent monad form might
perfectly well survive unaltered and fitted for its simple
conditions, whilst the offspring of this very monad might
become fitted for more complex conditions. The one prim-
ordial prototype of all living and extinct creatures may,
it is possible, be now alive! Moreover, as you say, higher
forms might be occasionally degraded, the snake Typhlops
seems (? !) to have the habits of earth-worms. So that fresh
creations of simple forms seem to me wholly superfluous.
 Must you not assume a primeval creative power which
does not cut with uniformity, or how could man supervene /
I am not sure that I understand your remarks which follow
the above. We must, under present knowledge, assume the
creation of one or of a few forms in the same manner as philo-
sophers assume the existence of a power of attraction without
any explanation. But I entirely reject, as in my judgment
quite unnecessary, any subsequent addition  of new powers
and attributes and forces or of any  principle of improve-
ment, except in so far as every character which is naturally
selected or preserved is in some way an advantage or improve-
ment, otherwise it would not have been selected. If I were
convinced that I required such additions to the theory of
natural selection, I would reject it as rubbish, but I have firm
faith in it, as I cannot believe, that if false, it would explain so
many whole classes of facts, which, if I am in my senses, it
seems to explain. As far as I understand your remarks and
illustrations, you doubt the possibility, of gradations of intel-
lectual powers. Now, it seems to me, looking to existing
animals alone, that we have a very fine gradation in the intel-
lectual powers of the Vertebrata, with one rather wide gap (not
half so wide as in many cases of corporeal structure), between
say a Hottentot and an Ourang, even if civilised as much
mentally as the dog has been from the wolf. I suppose that
you do not doubt that the intellectual powers are as important
for the welfare of each being as corporeal structure ; if so, I
can see no difficulty in the most intellectual individuals of a
species being continually selected ; and the intellect of the
new species thus improved, aided probably by effects of
inherited mental exercise. I look at this process as now
going on with the races of man ; the less intellectual races
being exterminated. But there is not space to discuss this
point. If I understand you, the turning-point in our difference
must be, that you think it impossible that the intellectual
powers of a species should be much improved by the con-
tinued natural selection of the most intellectual individuals.
To show how minds graduate, just reflect how impossible
every one has yet found it, to define tlie difference in mind
of man and the lower animals ; the latter seem to have the
very same attributes in a much lower stage of perfection than
the lowest savage. I would give absolutely nothing for the
theory of Natural Selection, if it requires miraculous additions
at any one stage of descent. 1 think Embryology, Homo-
l��Sy> Classification, &c &c., show us that all vertebrata have
descended from one parent ; how that parent appeared we
know not. If you admit in ever so little a degree, the
explanation which I have given of Embryology, Homology
and Classification, you will find it difficult to say : thus far
the explanation holds good, hut no further; here we must
call in the addition of new creative forces. I think you
212 PUBLICATION OF THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES. [1859.
will be driven to reject all or admit all : I fear by your letter
it will be the former alternative ; and in that case I shall feel
sure it is my fault, and not the theorys fault, and this will
certainly comfort me. With regard to the descent of the
great Kingdoms (as Vertebrata, Articulata, &c.) from one
parent, I have said in the conclusion, that mere analogy
makes me think it probable ; my arguments and facts are
sound in my judgment only for each separate kingdom.
The forms which are beaten inluriting some inferiority in
common.  I dare say I have not been guarded enough, but
might not the term inferiority include less perfect adaptation
to physical conditions .>
My remarks apply not to single species, but to groups or
genera ; the species of most genera are adapted at least to
rather hotter, and rather less hot, to rather damper and dryer
climates ; and when the several species of a group are beaten
and exterminated by the several species of another group, it
will not, I think, generally be from each new species being
adapted to the climate, but from all the new species having
some common advantage in obtaining sustenance, or escaping
enemies. As groups arc concerned, a fairer illustration than
negro and white in Liberia would be the almost certain future
extinction of the genus ourang by the genus man, not owing
to man being better fitted for the climate, but owing to the
inherited intellectual inferiority of the Ourang-genus to Man-
genus, by his intellect, inventing fire-arms and cutting down
forests. I believe, from reasons given in my discussion, that
acclimatisation is readily effected under nature. It has taken
me so many years to disabuse my mind of the too great import-
ance of climate  its important influence being so conspicuous,
whilst that of a struggle between creature and creature is so
hidden  that I am inclined to swear at the North Pole, and
as Sydney Smith said, even to speak disrespectfully .of the
Equator. I beg you often to reflect (I have found nothing
so instructive) on the case of thousands of plants in the

middle point of their respective ranges, and which, as we
positively know, can perfectly well withstand a little more
heat and cold, a little more damp and dry, but which in
the metropolis of their range do not exist in vast numbers,
although, if many of the other inhabitants were destroyed
[they] would cover the ground. We thus clearly see that
their numbers are kept down, in almost every case, not by
climate, but by the struggle with other organisms. All this
you will perhaps think very obvious ; but, until I repeated it
to myself thousands of times, I took, as I believe, a wholly
wrong view of the whole economy of nature. . . .
Hybridism .  I am so much pleased that you approve of
this chapter ; you would be astonished at the labour this
cost me ; so often was I, on what I believe was, the wrong
Rudimentary Organs .  On the theory of Natural Selection
there is a wide distinction between Rudimentary Organs and
what you call germs of organs, and what I call in my bigger
book nascent organs. An organ should not be called rudi-
mentary unless it be useless  as teeth which never cut through
the gums  the papillm, representing the pistil in male flowers,
wing of Apteryx, or better, the little wings under soldered
elytra. These organs are now plainly useless, and <J fortiori,
they would be useless in a less developed state. Natural Selec-
tion acts exclusively by preserving successive slight, useful
modifleations. Hence Natural Selection cannot possibly make
a useless or rudimentary organ. Such organs are solely due
to inheritance (as explained in my discussion), and plainly
bespeak an ancestor having the organ in a useful condition.
They may be, and often have been, worked in for other pur-
poses, and then they are only rudimentary for the original
function, which is sometimes plainly apparent. A nascent
organ, though little developed, as it has to be developed must
be useful in every stage of development. As we cannot
prophesy, we cannot tell what organs arc now nascent ; and
214 PUBLICATION OF THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES. [1859.
nascent organs will rarely have been handed down by certain
members of a class from a remote period to the present day,
for beings with any important organ but little developed, will
generally have been supplanted by their descendants with the
organ well developed. The mammary glands in Ornitho-
rhynchus may, perhaps, be considered as nascent compared
with the udders of a cow  Ovigerous frena, in certain cirripedcs,
are nascent branchiae  in [illegible] the swim bladder is almost
rudimentary for this purpose, and is nascent as a lung. The
small wing of penguin, used only as a fin, might be nascent
as a wing ; not that I think so ; for the whole structure of the
bird is adapted for flight, and a penguin so closely resembles
other birds, that we may infer that its wings have probably
been modified, and reduced by natural selection, in accordance
with its sub-aquatic habits. Analogy thus often serves as a
guide in distinguishing whether an organ is rudimentary or
nascent I believe the Os coccyx gives attachment to certain
muscles, but I cannot doubt that it is a rudimentary tail.
The bastard wing of birds is a rudimentary digit ; and I
believe that if fossil birds are found very low down in the
series, they will be seen to have a double or bifurcated wing.
Here is a bold prophecy 1
To admit prophetic germs, is tantamount to rejecting the
theory of Natural Selection.
I am very glad you think it worth while to run through my
book again, as much, or more, for the subjects sake as for my
own sake. But I look at your keeping the subject for some
little time before your mind  raising your own difficulties
and solving them  as far more important than reading my
book. If you think enough, I expect you will be perverted,
and if you ever are, I shall know that the theory of Natural
Selection is, in the main, safe ; that it includes, as now put
forth, many errors, is almost certain, though I cannot see
them. Do not, of course, think of answering this ; but if you have
other occasion to write again, just say whether I have, in ever

My dear Sir,  I have ventured to send you a copy of my
book (as yet only an abstract) on the Origin of Species.
As the conclusions at which I have arrived on several points
differ so widely from yours, I have thought (should you at
any time read my volume) that you might think that I had
sent it to you out of a spirit of defiance or bravado ; but I
assure you that I act under a wholly different frame of mind.
I hope that you will at least give me credit, however erro-
neous you may think my conclusions, for having earnestly
endeavoured to arrive at the truth. With sincere respect,
I beg leave to remain.
Yours very faithfully,

Dear Sir,  I have thought that you would permit me to
send you (by Messrs. Williams and Norgate, booksellers)
a copy of my work (as yet only an abstract) on the  Origin
of Species. I wish to do this, as the only, though quite
inadequate manner, by which I can testify to you the extreme
interest which I have felt, and the great advantage which I
have derived, from studying your grand and noble work on
Geographical Distribution. Should you be induced to read
my volume, I venture to remark that it will be intelligible
only by reading the whole straight through, as it is very much
condensed. It would be a high gratification to me if any
portion interested you. But I am perfectly well aware that
you will entirely disagree with the conclusion at which I have

My dear Gray,  I have directed a copy of my book (as

you. I know how you are pressed for time ; but if you can
read it, I shall be infinitely gratified .... If ever you
do read it, and can screw out time to send me (as I value
your opinion so highly), however short a note, telling me
what you think its weakest and best parts, I should be ex-
tremely grateful. As you are not a geologist, you will excuse
my conceit in telling you that Lyell highly approves of the
two Geological chapters, and thinks that on the Imperfection

a convert to my views
Let me add I fully admit that there are very many diffi-
culties not satisfactorily explained by my theory of descent
with modification, but I cannot possibly believe that a false
theory would explain so many classes of facts as I think it
certainly does explain. On these grounds I drop my anchor,
and believe that the difficulties will slowly disappear. . . ,

show the amount of labour which I have bestowed on the

If you have time to read it carefully, and would take the
trouble to point out what parts seem weakest to you and
what best, it would be a most material aid to me in writing
my bigger book, which I hope to commence in a few months.
You know also how highly I value your judgment But I
am not so unreasonable as to wish or expect you to write
detailed and lengthy criticisms, but merely a few general
remarks, pointing out the weakest parts.
If you are in even so slight a degree staggered (which I
hardly expect) on the immutability of species, then I am
convinced with further reflection you will become more and
more staggered^ for this has been the process through which
my mind has gone. My dear Henslow,

to Brighton. I meant merely to thank you sincerely for
wishing to see such a worn-out old.dog as myself. I hardly

then we shall wish to rest under our own roof-tree.
I do not think I hardly ever admired a book more than

book is only an abstract, and very much condensed, and, to
be at all intelligible, must be carefully read. I shall be very
grateful for any criticisms. But I know perfectly well that
you will not at all agree with tlic lengths which I go. It took
long years to convert me. I may, of course, be egregiously
wrong ; but I cannot persuade myself that a theory which
explains (as I think it certainly does) several large classes of
facts, can be wholly wrong ; notwithstanding the several diffi-
culties which have to be surmounted somehow, and which
stagger me even to this day.
I wish that my health had allowed me to publish in
e.xtenso ; if ever I get strong enough I will do so, as the
greater part is written out, and of which MS. the present
volume is an abstract.
I fear this note will be almost illegible ; but I am poorly,
and can hardly sit up. Farewell ; with thanks for your kind
note, and pleasant remembrances of good old days.

receive it at nearly the same time with this note. (N.B. I
have got a bad finger, which makes me write extra badly.)
If you are so inclined, I should very much like to hear your
general impression of the book, as you have thought so pro-
foundly on the subject, and in so nearly the same channel
with myself. I hope there will be some little new to you, but
I fear not much. Remember it is only an abstract, and very
much condensed. God knows what the public will think. No
one has read it, except Lyell, with whom I have had much
correspondence. Hooker thinks him a complete convert, but

in the theory will be overlooked by the real judges, as
Hooker, Lyell, Asa Gray, &c.. I have heard from Mr. Sclater
that your paper on the Malay Archipelago has been read
at the Linnean Society, and that he was extremely much
interested by it
I have not seen one naturalist for six or nine months,
owing to the state of my health, and therefore I really have
no news to tell you. I am writing this at Ilkley Wells, where
I have been with my family for the last six weeks, and shall
stay for some few weeks longer. As yet I have profited
very little. God knows when I shall have strength for my
bigger book.
I sincerely hope that you keep your health ; I suppose that
you will be thinking of returning* soon with your magni-

will be puzzled how to publish. The Royal Society fund will
be worth your consideration. With every good wish, pray

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to W. B. Carpenter.
Ilkley, Yorkshire,
November i8th [1859].
My dear Carpenter,  I must thank you for your letter
on my own account, and, if I know myself, still more warmly
for the subjects sake. As you seem to have understood my
last chapter without reading the previous chapters, you must
have maturely and most profoundly self-thought out the sub-
ject; for I have found the most extraordinary difficulty in
making even able men understand at what I was driving.
There will be strong opposition to my views. If I am in the
main right (of course including partial errors unseen by me),
the admission of my views will depend far more on men, like
yourself, with well-established reputations, than on my own
writings. Therefore, on the supposition that when you have
read my volume you think the view in the main true, I thank
and honour you for being willing to run the chance of unpopu-
larity by advocating the view. I know not in the least
whether any one will review me in any of the Reviews. I do
not see how an author could enquire or interfere ; but if you
are willing to review me anywhere, I am sure from the admira-
tion which I have long felt and expressed for your  Compara-

without thanking you for your note. You will have a tough

do not think (privately I say it) that the great man has know-
ledge enough to enter on the subject Pray believe me with

Record not exaggerated.

Ilkley, Yorkshire,
November 15th [1859].
My dear Carpenter,  I beg pardon for troubling you
again. If, after reading my book, you are able to come to a
conclusion in any degree definite, will you think me very un-
reasonable in asking you to let me hear from you. I do not
ask for a long discussion, but merely for a brief idea of your
general impression. From your widely extended knowledge,
habit of investigating the truth, and abilities, I should value
your opinion in the very highest rank. Though I, of course,
believe in the truth of my own doctrine, I suspect that no
bcUef is vivid until shared by others. As yet I know only one
believer, but I look at him as of the greatest authority, viz.
Hooker. When I think of the many cases of men who
have studied one subject for years, and have persuaded

sometimes a little frightened, whether I may not be one of
these monomaniacs.
Again pray excuse this, I fear, unreasonable request. A
short note would suffice, and I could bear a hostile verdict, and
shall have to bear many a one.
Yours very sincerely,
C. Darwin.

My dear Hooker,  I have just read a review on my
book in the Athenceum* and it excites my curiosity much
who is the author. If you should hear who writes in the
Athenteum I wish you would tell me. It seems to me well
done, but the reviewer gives no new objections, and, being
hostile, passes over every single argument in favour of the
doctrine, ... I fear from the tone of the review, that I have
written in a conceited and cocksure style,f which shames
me a little. There is another review of which I should like
to know the author, viz. of H. C. Watson in the Gardeners'
Chronicle. X Some of the remarks are like yours, and he does
deserve punishment ; but surely the review is too severe.

H. C. CTTXTHR Watson to C. Darwuu
Thames Ditton, November 21st [1859].
My dear Sir,  Once commenced to read the  Origin, I
could not rest till I had galloped through the whole. I shall
now begin to re-read it more deliberately. Meantime I am
tempted to write you the first impressions, not doubting that
they will, in the main, be the permanent impressions :
1st. Your leading idea will assuredly become recognised as
an established truth in science, ije. Natural selection. It
has the characteristics of all great natural truths, clarifying
what was obscure, simplifying what was intricate, adding
greatly to previous knowledge. You are the greatest revo-
lutionist in natural history of this century, if not of all
centuries.
2nd. You will perhaps need, in some degree, to limit or
modify, possibly in some degree also to extend, your present
applications of the principle of natural selection. Without
going to matters of more detail, it strikes me that there is
one considerable primary inconsistency, by one failure in the
analogy between varieties and species ; another by a sort of
barrier assumed for nature on insufficient grounds, and arising
from divergence These may, however, be faults in my

own mind, attributable to yet incomplete perception of your
views. And I had better not trouble you about them before
again reading the volume.
3rd. Now these novel views are brought fairly before the
scientific public, it seems truly remarkable how so many of
them could have failed to see their right road sooner. How
could Sir C. Lyell, for instance, for thirty years read, write,
and think, on the subject of species and their succession, and
yet constantly look down the wrong road !
A quarter of a century ago, you and I must have been in
something like the same state of mind on the main question.
But you wore able to see and work out the quo modo of the
succession, the all-important thing, while I failed to grasp it.
I send by this post a little controversial pamphlet of old
date  Combe and Scott. If you will take the trouble to
glance at the passages scored on the margin, you will see
that, a quarter of a century ago, I was also one of the few who
then doubted the absolute distinctness of species, and special
creations of them. Yet I, like the rest, failed to detect the
quo modo which was reserved for your penetration to discover,
and your discernment to apply.
You answered my query about the hiatus behveen Satyrus
and Homo as was expected. The obvious explanation really
never occurred to me till some months after I had read the
papers in the  Linnean Proceedings. The first species of
Fere-homo * would soon make direct and exterminating war
upon his Infra-homo cousins. The gap would thus be made,
and then go on increasing, into the present enormous and
still widening hiatus. But how greatly this, with your
chronology of animal life, will shock the ideas of many

phenomena  it is capitally written, and will be very suc-

pleasing to my vanity ; but, my dear fellow, neither my name
nor my judgment nor my assistance deserved any such com-

what I dont deserve, it must just pass. How different the

As advocate, he might think himself justified in giving the
aigument only on one side. But the manner in which he
drags in immortality, and sets the priests at me, and leaves
me to their mercies, is base. He would, on no account, burn
me, but he will get the wood ready, and tell the black beasts
how to catch me. ... It would be unspeakably grand if
Huxley were to lecture on the subject, but I can see this is a
mere chance ; Faraday might think it too unorthodox.

praise of my book, that modesty (as I am trying to cultivate

My dear Lyell,  You seemed to have worked admirably
on the species question ; there could not have been a better
plan than reading up on the opposite side. I rejoice pro-
foundly that you intend admitting the doctrine of modifica-
tion in your new edition ;* nothing, I am convinced, could be
more important for its success. I honour you most sincerely.

fact to which I much doubt whether the records of science offer
a parallel. For myself, also, I rejoice profoundly ; for, thinking
of so many cases of men pursuing an illusion for years, often
and often a cold shudder has run through me, and I have
asked myself whether I may not have devoted my life to a
phantasy. Now I look at it as morally impossible that in-
vestigators of truth, like you and Hooker, can be wholly
wrong, and therefore I rest in peace. Thank you for criti-
cisms, which, if there be a second edition, I will attend to.
I have been thinking that if I am much execrated as an
atheist, &c., whether the admission of the doctrine of natural
selection could injure your works ; but I hope and think not,
for, as far as I can remember, the virulence of bigotry is
expended on the first offender, and those who adopt his views
are only pitied as deluded, by the wise and cheerful bigots.
1 cannot help thinking that you overrate the importance of
the multiple origin of dogs. The only difference is, that in the
case of single origins, all difference of the races has originated
since man domesticated the species. In the case of multiple
origins, part of the difference was produced under natural con-
ditions. I should infinitely prefer the theory of single origin
in all cases, if facts would permit its reception. But there
seems to me some a priori improbability (seeing how fond
savages are of taming animals), that throughout all times, and
throughout all the world, man should have domesticated one
single species alone, of the widely distributed genus Canis.
Besides this, the close resemblance of at least three kinds of
American domestic dogs to wild species still inhabiting the
countries where they are now domesticated, seems to almost
compel admission that more than one wild Canis has been
domesticated by man.
I thank you cordially for all the generous zeal and interest
you have shown about my book, and I remain, my dear Lyell,

My dear Darwin,  I finished your book yesterday, a
lucky examination having furnished me with a few hours of
continuous leisure.
Since I read Von Bars * essays, nine years ago, no work on
Natural History Science I have met with has made so great
an impression upon me, and I do most heartily thank you for
the great store of new views you have given me. Nothing, I
think, can be better than the tone of the book, it impresses
those who know nothing about the subject As for your
doctrine, I am prepared to go to the stake, if requisite, in sup-
port of Chapter IX., and most parts of Chapters X., XI., XII.,
and Chapter XIII. contains much that is most admirable,
but on one or two points I enter a caveat until I can see
further into all sides of the question.
As to the first four chapters, I agree thoroughly and fully
with all the principles laid down in them. I think you have
demonstrated a true cause for the production of species, and
have thrown the onus probandi, that species did not arise in
the way -you suppose, on your adversaries.
But I feel that I have not yet by any means fully
realized the bearings of those most remarkable and original

Chapters III., IV. and V., and I will write no more about
them just now.
The only objections that have occurred to me are, ist that
you have loaded yourself with an unnecessary difficulty in
adopting Natura non facit saltuvi so unreservedly. . . . And
2nd, it is not clear to me why, if continual physical conditions
are of so little moment as you suppose, variation should
occur at all.
However, I must read the book two or three times more
before I presume to begin picking holes.
I trust you will not allow yourself to be in any way dis-
gusted or annoyed by the considerable abuse and mis-
representation which, unless I greatly mistake, is in store for
you. Depend upon it you have earned the lasting gratitude
of all thoughtful men. And as to the curs which will bark
and yelp, you must recollect that some of your friends, at
any rate, are endowed with an amount of combativeness
which (though you have often and justly rebuked it) may
stand you in good stead.
I am sharpening up my claws and beak in readiness.
Looking back over my letter, it really expresses so feebly
all I think about you and your noble book that I am half
ashamed of it ; but you will understand that, like the parrot
in the story,  I think the more.

My dear Huxley,  Your letter has been forwarded to
me from Down. Like a good Catholic who has received
extreme unction, I can now sing  nunc dimittis. I should
have been more than contented with one quarter of what you
have said. Exactly fifteen months ago, when I put pen to

paper for this volume, I had awful misgivings ; and thought
perhaps I had deluded myself, like so many have done,
and I then fixed in my mind three judges, on whose decision
I determined mentally to abide. The judges were Lyell,
Hooker, and yourself. It was this which made me so exces-
sively anxious for your verdict. I am now contented, and
can sing my " nunc dimittis. What a joke it would be if I
pat you on the back when you attack some immovable crea-
tionists ! You have most cleverly hit on one point, which has
greatly troubled me ; if, as I must think, external conditions
produce little direct effect, what the devil determines each
particular variation? What makes a tuft of feathers come
on a cocks head, or moss on a moss-rose ? I shall much like
to talk over this with you. . . .
My dear Huxley, I thank you cordially for your letter.
Yours very sincerely,
C. Darwin.
P.S.  Hereafter I shall be particidarly curious to hear what
you think of my explanation of Embryological similarity.

Dear Charles,  I am so much weaker in the head, that
I hardly know if I can write, but at all events I will jot down
a few things that the Dr.* has said. He has not read much
above half, so as he says he can give no definite conclusion,
and it is my private belief he wishes to remain in that state.
... He is evidently in a dreadful state of indecision, and
keeps stating that he is not tied down to either view, and that
he has always left an escape by the way he has spoken of
 Dr., afterwards Sir Henry Holland.

varieties. I happened to speak of the eye before he had read
that part, and it took away his breath  utterly impossible
structure  function, &c., &c.. See., but when he had read it he
hummed and hawed, and perhaps it was partly conceivable,
and then he fell back on the bones of the ear, which were
beyond all probability or conceivability. He mentioned a
slight blot, which I also observed, that in speaking of the
slave-ants carrying one another, you change the species
without giving notice first, and it makes one turn back. . . .
. . . For myself I really think it is the most interesting
book I ever read, and can only compare it to the first know-
ledge of chemistry, getting into a new world or rather behind
the scenes. To me the geographical distribution, I mean the
relation of islands to continents is the most convincing of the
proofs, and the relation of the oldest forms to the existing
species. I dare say I dont feel enough the absence of
varieties, but then I dont in the least know if everything
now living were fossilized whether the palaeontologists could
distinguish them. In fact the d priori reasoning is so entirely
satisfactory to me that if the facts wont fit in, why so much
the worse for the facts is my feeling. My ague has left me
in such a state of torpidity that I wish I had gone through
the process of natural selection.
Yours affectionately,

[With regard to a French translation, he wrote to Mr.
Murray in Nov. 1859: I am extremely anxious, for the
subjects sake (and God knows not for mere fame), to have
my book translated ; and indirectly its being known abroad
will do good to the English sale. If it depended on me,
I shouid agree without payment, and instantly send a copy,
and only beg that she [Mme. Belloc] would get some scientific

though I am a very poor French scholar, I could detect any
.scientific mistake, and would read over the French proofs.

am not so silly as to expect to change his opinion.]

PROGRESS OF OPINION.

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to C. Lyell.
Ilkley, Yorkshire,
December 2nd [1859].
My dear Lyell,  Every note which you have sent me has
interested me much. Pray thank Lady Lyell for her remark..
In the chapters she refers to, I was unable to modify the pas-
sage in accordance to your suggestion ; but in the final
chapter I have modified three or four. Kingsley, in a note
to me, had a capital paragraph on such notions as mine being
not opposed to a high conception of the Deity. I have inserted
it as an extract from a letter to me from a celebrated author
and divine. I have put in about nascent organs. I had the
greatest difficulty in partially making out Sedgwicks letter, and
I dare say I did greatly underrate its clearness. Do what I
could, I fear I shall be greatly abused. In answer to Sedg-
wicks remark that my book would be  mischievous," I asked
him whether truth can be known except by being victorious
over all attacks. But it is no use. H. C. Watson tells me
that one zoologist says he will read my book,  but I will never
believe it." What a spirit to read any book in ! Crawford
writes to me that his notice t will be hostile, but that  he will
not calumniate the author. He says he has read my book,
 at least such parts as he could understand. He sent me
some notes and suggestions (quite unimportant), and they
show me that I have unavoidably done harm to the subject,
by publishing an abstract. He is a real Pallasian ; nearly all
our domestic races descended from a multitude of wild species
now commingled. I expected Murchison to be outrageous.

pronounce against me without much reflection, perhaps will

neither on Gods side nor on that of the devil.
I fully believe that I owe the comfort of the next few years
of my life to your generous support, and that of a very few
others. I do not think I am brave enough to have stood
being odious without support ; now I feel as bold as a lion.
But there[is one thing I can see I must learn, viz. to think
less of myself and my book. Farewell, with cordial thanks.
Yours most truly,

I return home on the yth, and shall sleep at Erasmuss. I
will call on you about ten oclock, on Thursday, the 8th, and sit

[In December there appeared in  Macmillans Magazine
an article, Time and Life, by Professor Huxley. It is
mainly occupied by an analysis of the argument of the
 Origin, but it also gives the substance of a lecture deliver-
ed at the Royal Institution before that book was published.
Professor Huxley spoke strongly in favour of evolution in his
Lecture, and explains that in so doing he was to a great
extent resting on a knowledge of  the general tenor of the
researches in which Mr. Darwin had been so long engaged,
and was supported in so doing by his perfect confidence in
his knowledge, perseverance, and  high-minded love of
truth. He was evidently deeply pleased by Mr. Huxleys
words, and wrote :
 I must thank you for your extremely kind notice of my
book in  Macmillan. No one could receive a more delightful

body of really good men, and mostly not old men. In the
long-run we shall conquer. I do not like being abused, but I

convinced that it is the first offender who reaps the rich
harvest of abuse. You have done an essential kindness in

I look at it as immaterial whether we go quite the same
lengths ; and I suspect. Judging from myself, that you will go
further, by thinking of a population of forms like Ornitho-
rhynchus, and by thinking of the common homological and
cmbryological structure of the several vertebrate orders. But
this is immaterial. I quite agree that the principle is every-
thing. In my fuller MS. I have discussed a good many
instincts ; but there will surely be more unfilled gaps here
than with corporeal structure, for we have no fossil instincts,
and know scarcely any except of European animals. When
I reflect how very slowly I came round myself, I am in truth

degree favourable.*
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to C. Lyell.
Saturday [December 5th, 1859].
... I have had a letter from Carpenter this morning. He
reviews me in the  National. He is a convert, but does not
go quite so far as I, but quite far enough, for he admits that
all birds are from one progenitor, and probably all fishes and
reptiles from another parent But the last mouthful chokes
him. He can hardly admit all vertebrates from one parent.
He will surely come to this from Homology and Embryology.
I look at it as grand having brought round a great physio-
logist, for great I think he certainly is in that line. How
curious I shall be to know what line Owen will take: dead
against us, I fear ; but he wrote me a most liberal note on the
reception of my book, and said he was quite prepared to
consider fairly and without prejudice my line of argument.

heads twenty times running. I asked him what he thought
the weakest part He said he had no particular objection to
any part He added :
 If I must criticise, I should say, we do not want to know
what Darwin believes and is convinced of, but what he can
prove. I agreed most fully and truly that I have probably
greatly sinned in this line, and defended my general line of
argument of Inventing a theory and seeing how many classes
of facts the theory would explain. I added that I would en-
deavour to modify the  believes  and  convinceds. He took
me up short : "You will then spoil your book, the charm of (I)

plained everything, and that it was improbable in the highest
degree that I should succeed in this. I quite agree with this
rather queer objection, and it comes to this that my book
must be very bad or very good. . . .

cram-full of matter and reasoning. I am all the more glad
that you have published in this form, for the three volumes,
unprefaced by this, would have choked any Naturalist of the
nineteenth century, and certainly have softened my brain in
the operation of assimilating their contents. I am perfectly
tired of marvelling at the wonderful amount of facts you have
brought to bear, and your skill in marshalling them and
throwing them on the enemy ; it is also extremely clear as
far as I have gone, but very hard to fully appreciate. Some-
how it reads very different from the MS., and I often fancy that
I must have been very stupid not to have more fully followed
it in MS. Lyell told me of his criticisms. I did not appre-

My dear Hooker,  Your approval of my book, for many
reasons, gives me intense satisfaction ; but I must make some
allowance for your kindness and sympathy. Any one with
ordinary faculties, if he had patience enough and plenty of
time, could have written my book. You do not know how I
admire your and Lyells generous and unselfish sympathy ; I
do not believe either of you would have cared so much about
your own work. My book, as yet, has been far more suc-
cessful than I ever even formerly ventured in the wildest day-
dreams to anticipate. We shall soon be a good body of
working men, and shall have, I am convinced, all young and
rising naturalists on our side. I shall be intensely interested
to hear whether my book produces any effect on A. Gray ;
from what I heard at Lyells, I fancy your correspondence has
brought him some way already. I fear that there is no
chance of Bentham being staggered. Will he read my book ?

has not. Old J. E. Gray,* at the British Museum, attacked

be very glad of an American Edition. I have made up my
mind to be well abused ; but I think it of importance that my
notions should be read by intelligent men, accustomed to
scientific argument, though not naturalists. It may seem
absurd, but I think such men will drag after them those
naturalists who have too firmly fixed in their heads that a
species is an entity. The first edition of 1250 copies was sold

how big it is : I shall not be able to read it very soon. It
was very good of you to send Naudin, for I was very curious
to see it I am surprised that Decaisne should say it was
the same as mine. Naudin gives artificial selection, as well
as a score of English writers, and when he says species were
formed in the same manner, I thought the paper would cer-
tainly prove exactly the same as mine. But I cannot find
one word like the struggle for existence and natural selection.
On the contrary, he brings in his principle (p. 103) of finality
(which I do not understand), which, he says, with some authors
is fatality, with others providence, and which adapts the forms
of every being, and harmonises them all throughout nature.
He assumes like old geologists (who assumed that the forces
of nature were formerly greater), that species were at first
more plastic. His simile of tree and classification is like
mine (and others), but he cannot, I think, have reflected
much on the subject, otherwise he would see that genealogy
by itself does not give classification ; I declare I cannot see a
much closer approach to Wallace and me in Naudin than
in Lamarck  ^we all agree in modification and descent. If
I do not hear from you I will return the  Revue  in a few
days (with the cover). I dare say Lyell would be glad to see
it. By the way, I will retain the volume till I hear whether
I shall or not send it to Lyell. I should rather like Lyell
to see this note, though it is foolish work sticking up for
independence or priority.

been overlooked among my book-parcels, which often remain

So soon as I opened it I began to read it, and I finished it,
after many interruptions, on Tuesday. Yesterday I was em-
ployed  1st, in preparing for my lecture ; 2ndly, in attending
a meeting of my brother Fellows to discuss the final proposi-
tions of the Parliamentary Commissioners ; srdly, in lecturing ;
4thly, in hearing the conclusion of the discussion and the
College reply, whereby, in conformity with my own wishes, we
accepted the scheme of the Commissioners ; 5thly, in dining

Lastly, in looking through the Times to see what was going
on in the busy world.
I do not state this to fill space (though I believe that
Nature does abhor a vacuum), but to prove that my reply and
my thanks are sent to you by the earliest leisure I have, though
that is but a very contracted opportunity. If I did not think
you a good-tempered and truth-loving man, I should not tell
you that (spite of the great knowledge, store of facts, capital
views of the correlation of the various parts of organic nature,
admirable hints about the diffusion, through wide regions, of
many related organic beings, &c. &c.) I have read your book
with more pain than pleasure. Parts of it I admired greatly,
parts I laughed at till my sides were almost sore ; other parts
I read with absolute sorrow, because I think them utterly
false and grievously mischievous. You have deserted  after
a start in that tram-road of all solid physical truth  the true
method of induction, and started us in machinery as wild,
I think, as Bishop Wilkinss locomotive that was to sail with
us to the moon. Many of your wide conclusions are based

word, because more close to the cause of the fact ? For you
do not deny causation. I call (in the abstract) causation the
will of God ; and I can prove that He acts for the good of
His creatures. He also acts by laws which we can study
and comprehend. Acting by law, and under what is called
final causes, comprehends, I think, your whole principle.
You write of  natural selection  as if it were done consciously
by the selecting agent Tis but a consequence of the pre-
supposed development, and the subsequent battle for life.
This view of nature you have stated admirably, though
admitted by all naturalists and denied by no one of common
sense. We all admit development as a fact of history : but
how came it about ? Here, in language, and still more in
logic, we are point-blank at issue. There is a moral or meta-
physical part of nature as well as a physical. A man who
denies this is deep in the mire of folly. Tis the crown and
glory of organic science that it does through final cause, link
material and moral ; and yet does not allow us to mingle
them in our first conception of laws, and our classification
of such laws, whether we consider one side of nature or the
other. You have ignored this link ; and, if I do not mistake
your meaning, you have done your best in one or two preg-
nant cases to break it. Were it possible (which, thank God, it is
not) to break it, humanity, in my mind, would suffer a damage
that might brutalize it, and sink the human race into a lower
grade of degradation than any into which it has fallen since
its written records tell us of its history. Take the case of the
bee-cells. If your development produced the successive
modification of the bee and its cells (which no mortal can
prove), final cause would stand good as the directing cause
under which the successive generations acted and gradually
improved. Passages in your book, like that to which I have
250 PUBLICATION OF THE  ORIGIN OF SPECIES  [1859.
alluded (and there are others almost as bad), greatly shocked
my moral taste. I think, in speculating on organic descent,
you over-stsX^ the evidence of geology ; and that you under-
state it while you are talking of the broken links of your
natural pedigree : but my paper is nearly done, and I must
go to my lecture-room. Lastly, then, I greatly dislike the con-
cluding chapter not as a summary, for in that light it appears
good  but I dislike it from the tone of triumphant confidence
in which you appeal to the rising generation (in a tone I con-
demned in the author of the  Vestiges ) and prophecy of things
not yet in the womb of time, nor (if we are to trust the accumu-
lated experience of human sense and the inferences of its
logic) ever likely to be found anywhere but in the fertile womb
of mans imagination. And now to say a word about a son of
a monkey and an old friend of yours : I am better, far better,
than I was last year. I have been lecturing three days
a week (formerly I gave six a week) without much fatigue,
but I find by the loss of activity and memory, and of all pro-
ductive powers, that my bodily frame is sinking slowly towards
the earth. But I have visions of the future. They are as
much a part of myself as my stomach and my heart, and these
visions are to have their antitype in solid fruition of what is
best and greatest. But on one condition only  that I humbly
accept Gods revelation of Himself both in His works and in
His word, and do my best to act in conformity with that
knowledge which He only can give me, and He only can
sustain me in doing. If you and 1 do all this, we shall meet
in heaven.
I have written in a hurry, and in a spirit of brotherly love,,
therefore forgive any sentence you happen to dislike; and
believe me, spite of any disagreement in some points of the
deepest moral interest, your true-hearted old friend,

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to T. H. Huxley.
Down, Dec. 25th [1859].
My dear Huxley,  One part of your note has pleased
me so much that I must thank you for it Not only Sir
H. H. [Holland], but several others, have attacked me about
analogy leading to belief in one primordial created form.*
(By which I mean only that we know nothing as yet [of] how
life originates.) I thought I was universally condemned on
this head. But I answered that though perhaps it would
have been more prudent not to have put it in, I would not
strike it out, as it seemed to me probable, and I give it on
no other grounds. You will see in your mind the kind of
arguments which made me think it probable, and no one
fact had so great an effect on me as your most curious remarks
on the apparent homologies of the head of Vertebrata and
Articulata.
You have done a real good turn in the Agency business t
(I never before heard of a hard-working, unpaid agent besides
yourself), in talking with Sir H. H., for he will have great
influence over many. He floored me from my ignorance
about the bones of the ear, and I made a mental note to ask
you what the facts were.
With hearty thanks and real admiration for your generous
zeal for the subject.

as I ought to be, but one can avoid doing anything in

I do not believe one iota about your having assimilated any
of my notions unconsciously. You have always done me more
than justice. But I do think I did you a bad turn by getting
you to read the old MS., as it must have checked your own
original thoughts. There is one thing I am fully convinced
of, that the future progress (which is the really important
point) of the subject will have depended on really good and
w'ell-known workers, like yourself, Lyell, and Huxley, having
taken up the subject, than on my own work. I see plainly it
is this that strikes my non-scientific friends.

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to T. H. Huxley.
Down, Dec. 28th [1859].
My dear Huxley,  Yesterday evening, when I read the
Times of a previous day, I was amazed to find a splendid
essay and review of me. Who can the author be? I am
intensely curious. It included an eulogium of me which quite
touched me, though I am not vain enough to think it all
deserved. The author is a literary man, and German scholar.
He has read my book very attentively ; but, what is very
remarkable, it seems that he is a profound naturalist. He
knows my Barnacle-book, and appreciates it too highly.
Lastly, he writes and thinks with quite uncommon force and
clearness ; and what is even still rarer, his writing is seasoned
with most pleasant wit We all laughed heartily over some
of the sentences. I was charmed with those unreasonable
mortals, who know anything, all thinking fit to range them-
selves on one side.* Who can it be? Certainly I should
have said that there was only one man in England who could
have written this essay, and that you were the man. But I
suppose I am wrong, and that there is some hidden genius of
great calibre. For how could you influence Jupiter Olympius
and make him give three and a half columns to pure science ?
The old fogies will think the world will come to an end.
Well, whoever the man is, he has done great service to the
cause, far more than by a dozen reviews in common peri-
odicals. The grand way he soars above common religious
 The reviewer proposes to pass
by the orthodox view, according to
which the phenomena of the organic
world are  the immediate product
of a creative fiat, and consequently
are out of the domain of science
altogether." And he does so  with
less hesitation, as it so happens
that those persons who arc prac-
tically conversant with the facts of
the case (plainly a considerable
advantage) have always thought
fit to range themselves in the
category of those holding views
which profess to rest on a scientific
basis only, and therefore admit
of being argued to their conse-
quences.
254 PUBLICATION OF THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES. [1859.
prejudices, and the admission of such views into the Times,
I look at as of the highest importance, quite independently of
the mere question of species. If you should happen to be
acquainted with the author, for Heaven-sake tell me who
he is?
My dear Huxley, yours most sincerely,
C. Darwin.
[It is impossible to give in a short space an adequate idea
of Mr. Huxleys article in the Times of December 26. It is
admirably planned, so as to claim for the  Origin  a respectful
hearing, and it abstains from anything like dogmatism in
asserting the truth of the doctrines therein upheld. A few pas-
sages may be quoted :   That this most ingenious hypothesis
enables us to give a reason for many apparent anomalies in the
distribution of living beings in time and space, and that it is not
contradicted by the main phenomena of life and organisation,
appear to us to be unquestionable. Mr. Huxley goes on to
recommend to the readers of the  Origin  a condition of
"thdtige Skepsis "  a state of doubt which so loves truth
that it neither dares rest in doubting, nor extinguish itself
by unjustified belief. The final paragraph is in a strong
contrast to Professor Sedgwick and his  ropes of bubbles
(see p. 298). Mr. Huxley writes :  Mr. Darwin abhors mere
speculation as nature abhors a vacuum. He is as greedy of
cases and precedents as any constitutional lawyer, and all the
principles he lays down are capable of being brought to the
test of observation and experiment. The path he bids us
follow professes to be not a mere airy track, fabricated of
ideal cobwebs, but a solid and broad bridge of facts. If it be
so, it will carry us safely over many a chasm in our know-
ledge, and lead us to a region free from the snares of those
fascinating but barren virgins, the Final Causes, against whom
a high authority has so justly warned us.
There can be no doubt that this powerful essay, appearing

as it did in the leading daily Journal, must have had a strong
influence on the reading public. Mr. Huxley allows me to
quote from a letter an account of the happy chance that threw
into his hands the opportunity of writing it.
 CTTXTHR The  Origin  was sent to Mr. Lucas, one of the staff of
the Times writers at that day, in what I suppose was the
ordinary course of business. Mr. Lucas, though an excellent
journalist, and, at a later period, editor of  Once a Week,
was as innocent of any knowledge of science as a babe, and
bewailed himself to an acquaintance on having to deal with
such a book. Whereupon he was recommended to ask me to
get him out of his difficulty, and he applied to me accordingly,
explaining, however, that it would be necessary for him
formally to adopt anything 'I might be disposed to write, by
prefacing it with two or three paragraphs of his own.
 I was too anxious to seize upon the opportunity thus
offered of giving the book a fair chance with the multitudinous
readers of the Times to make any difficulty about condi-
tions ; and being then very full of the subject, I wrote the
article faster, I think, than I ever wrote anything in my life,
and sent it to Mr. Lucas, who duly prefixed his opening
sentences.
" When the article appeared, there was much speculation as
to its authorship. The secret leaked out in time, as all secrets
will, but not by my aid ; and then I used to derive a good
deal of innocent amusement from the vehement assertions of
Some of my more acute friends, that they knew it was mine

C. CTTXTHR Danvin to J. D. Hooker.
Down, January 3rd [i860].
My dear Hooker, I have finished your Essay.* As
probably you would like to hear my opinion, though a non-
botanist, I will give it without any exaggeration. To my
judgment it is by far the grandest and most interesting essay,
on subjects of the nature discussed, I have ever read. You
know how I admired your former essays, but this seems to
me far grander. I like all the part after p. xxvi better than
the first part, probably because newer to me. I dare say you
will demur to this, for I think every author likes the most
speculative parts of his own productions. How superior your
essay is to the famous one of Brown (here will be sneer 1st
from you). You have made all your conclusions so admirably
clear, that it would be no use at all to be a botanist (sneer
No. 2). By Jove, it would do harm to affix any idea to the
long names of outlandish orders. One can look at your con-
clusions with the philosophic abstraction with which a mathe-
matician looks a.thh a X x + &c. &c. I hardly know
which parts have interested me most ; for over and over again
I exclaimed,  this beats all. The general comparison of the
Flora of Australia with the rest of the world, strikes me (as
before) as extremely original, good, and suggestive of many
reflections.
.... The invading Indian Flora is very interesting, but I
think the fact you mention towards the close of the essay
that the Indian vegetation, in contradistinction to the Ma-
layan vegetation, is found in low and level parts of the Malay
Islands, greatly lessens the difficulty which at first (page 1)
seemed so great There is nothing like ones own hobby-
horse. I suspect it is the same case as of glacial migration,
and of naturalised production  of production of greater area

conquering those of lesser ; of course the Indian forms would
have a greater difficulty in seizing on the cool parts of Aus-
tralia. I demur to your remarks (page 1), as not  conceiving
anything in soil, climate, or vegetation of India," which could
stop the introduction of Australian plants. Towards the close
of the essay (page civ), you have admirable remarks on our
profound ignorance of the cause of possible naturalisation
or introduction ; I would answer p. 1, by a later page, viz.
p. civ.
Your contrast of the south-west and south-east corners is
one of the most wonderful cases I ever heard of. . . . You
show the case with wonderful force. Your discussion on
mixed invaders of the south-east eomer (and of New Zealand)
is as curious and intricate a problem as of the races of men in
Britain. Your remark on a mixed invading Flora keeping
down or destroying an original Flora, which was richer in
number of species, strikes me as eminently new and important.
I am not sure whether to me the discussion on the New Zea-
land Flora is not even more instructive. I cannot too much
admire both. But it will require a long time to suck in all
the facts. Your case of the largest Australian orders having
none, or very few, species in New Zealand, is truly mar-
vellous. Anyhow, you have now demonstrated (together
with no mammals in New Zealand) (bitter sneer No. 3), that
New Zealand has never been continuously, or even nearly
eontinuously, united by land to Australia 1 ! At p. Lxxxi.x,
is the only sentence (on this subject) in the whole essay at
which I am much inclined to quarrel, viz. that no theory
of trans-oceanic migration ean explain, &c. &c. Now I
maintain against all the world, that no man knows anything
about the trans-oceanic power of migration. You do not
know whether or not the absent orders have seeds which
arc killed by sea-water, like almost all Leguminosae, and
like another order which I forget. Birds do not migrate

from CTTXTHR Australia to New Zealand, and therefore floatation seems
the only possible means ; but yet I maintain that we do not
know enough to argue on the question, especially as we do
not know the main fact whether the seeds of Australian
orders are killed by sea- water.
The discussion on European Genera is profoundly interest-
ing ; but here alone I earnestly beg for more information, viz.
to know which of these genera are absent in the Tropics of
the world, confined to temperate regions. I excessively
wish to know, on the notion of Glacial Migration, how much
modification has taken place in Australia. I had better
explain when we meet, and get you to go over and mark
the list.
.... The list of naturalised plants is extremely interest-
ing, but why at the end, in the name of all that is good and
bad, do you not sum up and comment on your facts } Come, I
will have a sneer at you in return for the many which you will
have launched at this letter. Should you [not] have remarked
on the number of plants naturalised in Australia and the
United States under extremely different climates, as showing
that climate is so important, and [on] the considerable
sprinkling of plants from India, North America, and South
Africa, as showing that the frequent introduction of seeds is
so important ? With respect to  abundance of unoccupied
ground in Australia, do you believe that European plants
introduced by man now grow on spots in Australia which
were absolutely bare ? But I am an impudent dog, one must
defend one's own fancy theories against such cruel men as
you. I dare say this letter will appear very conceited, but
one must form an opinion on what one reads with attention,
and in simple truth, I cannot find words strong enough to
express my admiration of your essay.
My dear old friend, yours affectionately,
C. Darwin.

P.S.  I differ about the Saturday Reviexv.* One cannot
expect fairness in a reviewer, so I do not complain of all
the other arguments besides the Geological Record being
omitted. Some of the remarks about the lapse of years are
very good, and the reviewer gives me some good and well-
deserved raps  confound it. I am sorry to confess the truth :
but it does not at all concern the main argument. That was
a nice notice in the Gardeners' Chronicle. I hope and imagine
that Lindley is almost a convert Do not forget to tell me

With respect to tropical plants during the Glacial period,
I throw in your teeth your own facts, at the base of the

forms of the tropical and temperate regions. I can give a

You will make a grand discussion on man. You are very bold

an excellently clear account of Mr. Wallaces and my views.
How capitally you turn the flanks of the theological opposers
by opposing to them such men as Bentham and the more
philosophical of the systematists ! I thank you sincerely for
the extremely honourable manner in which you mention me.
I should have liked to have seen some criticisms or remarks
on embryology, on which subject you are so well instructed.
I do not think any candid person can read your article with-
out being much impressed with it. The old doctrine of
immutability of specific forms will surely but slowly die away.
It is a shame to give you trouble, but I should be very much
obliged if you could tell me where differently coloured eggs

impression my book produces on philosophical and instructed
minds. I thank you for the kind things which you say ; and
you go with me much further than I expected. You will
think it presumptuous, but I am convinced, if circuinstatues
lead you to keep the subject in mind, that you will go further.
No one has yet cast doubts on my explanation of the sub-
ordination of group to group, on homologies, embryology,
and rudimentary organs ; and if my explanation of these
classes of facts be at all right, whole classes of organic beings
must be included in one line of descent
The imperfection of the Geological Record is one of the
greatest difficulties During the earliest period the
record would be most imperfect, and this seems to me
sufficiently to account for our not finding intermediate forms
between the classes in the same great kingdoms. It was
certainly rash in me putting in my belief of the probability of
all beings having descended from one primordial form ; but
as this seems yet to me probable, I am not willing to strike
it out. Hu.xley alone supports me in this, and something
could be said in its favour. With respect to man, I am very
far from wishing to obtrude my belief ; but I thought it
dishonest to quite conceal my opinion. Of course it is

to you, and several verbal ones to you and others ; I am
heartily glad you approve of them, as yet only two things
have annoyed me; those confounded millions t of years (not
that I think it is probably wrong), and my not having (by
inadvertence) mentioned Wallace towards the close of the

that it is not improbable that a
longer period than 300 million

I suspect I shall have to return the caution a hundred fold !
Yours will, no doubt, be a grand discussion ; but it will
horrify the world at first more than my whole volume ;
although by the sentence (p. 489, new edition *) I show that
I believe man is in the same predicament with other animals.
It is in fact impossible to doubt it I have thought (only
vaguely) on man. With respect to the races, one of my best
chances of truth has broken down from the impossibility of
getting facts. I have one good speculative line, but a man
must have entire credence in Natural Selection before he will
even listen to it. Psychologically, I have done scarcely any-
thing. Unless, indeed, expression of countenance can be
included, and on that subject I have collected a good many
facts, and speculated, but I do not suppose I shall ever
publish, but it is an uncommonly curious subject. By the
way I sent off a lot of questions the day before yesterday
to Tierra del Fuego on expression 1 I suspect (for I have
never read it) that Spencers  Psychology  has a bearing on

whole theory by an ingenious difficulty, which I was very
stupid not to have thought of ; for I express surprise at more
and analogous cases not being known. The difficulty is, that
amongst the blind insects of the caves in distant parts of the
world there are some of the same genus, and yet the genus is
not found out of the caves or living in the free world. I have
little doubt that, like the fish Amblyopsis, and like Proteus in
Europe, these insects are wrecks of ancient life, or "living
fossils," saved from competition and e.xtermination. But that

you are slaving yourself to death with hardly a minute to spare,
and you must write a review on my book I I thought it * a

Lindleys. Now that I know it is yours, I have re-read it, and
my kind and good friend, it has warmed my heart with all the
honourable and noble things you say of me and it. I was a

adapted to tell on the readers of the Gardeners' Chronicle ;

Cambridge, Mass.,
January 5th, i86a
My dear Hooker,  Your last letter, which reached me
just before Christmas, has got mislaid during the upturnings
in my study which take place at that season, and has not yet
been discovered. I should be very sorry to lose it, for there
were in it some botanical mems. which I had not secured. . .
The principal part of your letter was high laudation of
Darwins book.
Well, the book has reached me, and I finished its careful
perusal four days ago ; and I freely say that your laudation
is not out of place.
It is done in a masterly manner. It might well have taken
twenty years to produce it It is crammed full of most
interesting matter  thoroughly digested  well expressed
close, cogent, and taken as a system it makes out a better
case than I had supposed possible. . . .
Agassiz, when I saw him last, had read but a part of it
He says it is poor  very poor!} (entre nous). The fact [is]
he is very much annoyed by it, ... . and I do not wonder
at it. To bring all ideal system within the domain of science,
and give good physical or natural explanations of all his
capital points, is as bad as to have Forbes take the glacier
materials . . . and give scientific explanation of all the
phenomena.
Tell Darwin all this. I will write to him when I get a
chance. As I have promised, he and you shall have fair-play
here. ... I must myself write a review of Darwins book for
 Sillimans Journal  (the more so that I suspect Agassiz means
to come out upon it) for the next (March) No., and I am now
setting about it (when I ought to be every moment working
the Expl[oring] Expedition Compositae, which I know far more
about). And really it is no ea.sy job as you may well imagine.

I doubt if I shall please you altogether. I know I shall
not please Agassiz at all. I hear another reprint is in the
Press, and the book will excite much attention here, and
some controversy. . . .
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to Asa Gray.
Down, January 28th [i860].
My DEAR Gray,  Hooker has forwarded to me your letter
to him ; and I cannot express how deeply it has gratified
me. To receive the approval of a man whom one has long
sincerely respected, and whose judgment and knowledge are
most universally admitted, is the highest reward an author
can possibly wish for; and I thank you heartily for your
most kind expressions.
I have been absent from home for a few days, and so could
not earlier answer your letter to me of the loth of January.
You have been extremely kind to take so much trouble and
interest about the edition. It has been a mistake of my
publisher not thinking of sending over the sheets. I had
entirely and utterly forgotten your offer of receiving the
sheets as printed off. But I must not blame my publisher,
for had I remembered your most kind offer I feel pretty sure
I should not have taken advantage of it ; for I never dreamed
of my book being so successful with general readers : I believe
I should have laughed at the idea of sending the sheets to
America.*
After much consideration, and on the strong advice of Lyell
and others, I have resolved to have the present book as it is
(excepting correcting errors, or here and there inserting short

bring out the first part (forming a separate volume, with

corrections for an American edition. I enclose a list of a few
corrections in the second reprint, which you will have received
by this time complete, and I could send four or five corrections
or additions of equally small importance, or rather of equal
brevity. I also intend to write a short preface with a brief
history of the subject. These I will set about, as they must
some day be done, and I will send them to you in a short time
 the few corrections first, and the preface afterwards, unless
I hear that you have given up all idea of a separate edition.
You will then be able to judge whether it is worth having
the new edition with your review prefixed. Whatever be the
nature of your review, I itssure you I should feel it a great
honour to have my book thus preceded

Cambridge, January 23rd, i860.
My DEAR Darwin,  You have my hurried letter telling
you of the arrival of the remainder of the sheets of the reprint,
and of the stir I had made for a reprint in Boston. Well, all
looked pretty well, when, lo, we found that a second New
York publishing house had announced a reprint also! I wrote
then to both New York publishers, asking them to give way
to the author and his reprint of a revised edition. I got
an answer from the Harpers that they withdraw  from the
Applctons that they had got the book out (and the next day
I saw a copy) ; but that,  if the work should have any con-
siderable sale, we certainly shall be disposed to pay the
author reasonably and liberally.
The Applctons being thus out with their reprint, the Boston
house declined to go on. So I wrote to the Applctons taking

them at their word, offering to aid their reprint, to give them
the use of the alterations in the London reprint, as soon as I
find out what they are, &c. &c. And I sent them the first
leaf, and asked them to insert in their future issue the addi-
tional matter from Butler,* which tells just right. So there
the matter stands. If you furnish any matter in advance of
the London third edition, I will make them pay for it
I may get something for you. All got is clear gain ; but it
will not be very much, I suppose.
Such little notices in the papers here as have yet appeared
are quite handsome and considerate.
I hope next week to get printed sheets of my review from
New Haven, and send [them] to you, and will ask you to pass
them on to Dr. Hooker.
To fulfil your request, I ought to tell you what I think
the weakest, and what the best, part of your book. But
this is not easy, nor to be done in a word or hvo. The best
part, I think, is the w/iole, i.e. its plan and treatment, the vast
amount of facts and acute inferences handled as if you had a
perfect mastery of them. I do not think twenty years too
much time to produce such a book in.
Style clear and good, but now and then wants revision for
little matters (p. 97, self-fertilises itself, &c.).
Then your candour is worth everything to your cause. It
is refreshing to find a person with a new theory who frankly
confesses that he finds difficulties, insurmountable, at least
for the present. I know some people who never have any
difficulties to speak of.
The moment I understood your premisses, I felt sure you
had a real foundation to hold on. Well, if one admits your
premisses, I do not see how he is to stop short of your conclu-
sions, as a probable hypothesis at least.

It naturally happens that my review of your book does not
exhibit anything like the full force of the impression the book
has made upon me. Under the circumstances I suppose I do
your theory more good here, by bespeaking for it a fair and
favourable consideration, and by standing non-committed as
to its full conclusions, than I should if I announced myself a
convert ; nor could I say the latter, with truth.
Well, what seems to me the weakest point in the book is
the attempt to account for the formation of organs, the making
of eyes, &c., by natural selection. Some of this reads quite
Lamarckian.
The chapter on Hybridism is not a weak, but a strong
chapter. You have done wonders there. But still you have
not accounted, as you may be held to account, for divergence
up to a certain extent producing increased fertility of the
crosses, but carried one short almost imperceptible step more,
giving rise to sterility, or reversing the tendency. Very likely
you are on the right track ; but you have something to do yet
in that department.
Enough for the present.
I am not insensible to your compliments, the very
high compliment which you pay me in valuing my opinion.
You evidently think more of it than I do, though from the
way I write [to] you, and especially [to] Hooker, this might
not be inferred from the reading of my letters.
I am free to say that I never learnt so much from one book
as I have from yours. There remain a thousand things I long
to say about it
Ever yours,

and I wish I could feel all was deserved by me. I quite think
a review from a man, who is not an entire convert, if fair and
moderately favourable, is in all respects the best kind of
review. About the weak points I agree. The eye to this

known gradations, my reason tells me I ought to conquer

P.S.-.-I feel pretty sure, from my own experience, that if
you are led by your studies to keep the subject of the origin
of species before your mind, you will go further and further

astonished at the impression my book has made on many

.... As the  Origin  now stands, Harveys  is a good
hit against my talking so much of the insensibly fine grada-
tions ; and certainly it has astonished me that I should be
pelted with the fact, that I had not allowed abrupt and great
enough variations under nature. It would take a good deal
more evidence to make me admit that forms have often
changed by saltum.
* William Henry Harvey was
descended from a Quaker family of
Youghal, and was bom in Feb-
ruary, 1811, at Summerville, a
country house on the banks of the
Sh<innon. He died at Torquay in
1866. In 1835, Harvey went to
Africa (Table Bay) to pursue his
botanical studies, the results of
which were given in his  Genera of
South African Plants. In 1838,
ill-health compelled him to obtain
leave of absence, and return to
England for a time ; in 1840 he
returned to Cape Town, to be again
compelled by illness to leave. In
1843 he obtained the appointment
of Botanical Professor at Trinity
College, Dublin. In 1854, 1855,
and 1856 he visited Australia, New
Zealand, the Friendly and Fiji
Islands. In 1857 Dr. Harvey
reached home, and was appointed
the successor of Professor Allman
to the Chair of Botany in Dublin
University. He was author of
several botanical works, princi-
pally on Algae.  (From a Memoir
published in 1869.)

Have you seen Wollastons attack in the  Annals ?  The
stones are beginning to fly. But Theology has more to do
with these two attacks than Science. . . .
[In the above letter a paper by Harvey in the Gardefters
Chronicle, Feb. 18, i860, is alluded to. He describes a case
of monstrosity in Begonia frigida, in which the sport"
differed so much from a normal Begonia that it might have
served as the type of a distinct natural order. Harvey goes
on to ai^e that such a case is hostile to the theory of natural
selection, according to which changes are not supposed to
take place per saltum, and adds that  a few such cases would
overthrow it [Mr. Darwins hypothesis] altogether." In the
following number of the Gardenerd Chronicle Sir J. D. Hooker
showed that Dr. Harvey had misconceived the bearing of the
Begonia case, which he further showed to be by no means
calculated to shake the validity of the doctrine of modification
by means of natural selection. My father mentions the
Begonia case in a letter to Lyell (Feb. 18, i860):
 I send by this post an attack in the Gardeners Chronicle,
by Harvey (a first-rate Botanist, as you probably know). It
seems to me rather strange ; he assumes the permanence
of monsters, whereas, monsters are generally sterile, and not
often inheritable. But grant his case, it comes that I have
been too cautious in not admitting great and sudden varia-
tions. Here again comes in the mischief of my abstract. In
the fuller MS. I have discussed a parallel case of a normal
fish like a monstrous gold-fish.

graduated state of the flowers ! But what strikes me most is
that surely I ought to know my own book best, yet, by Jove,
you have brought forward ever so many arguments which
I did not think ofl Your reference to classification (viz. I
presume to such cases as Aspicarpa) is excellent, for the
monstrous Begonia no doubt in all details would be a Be-
gonia. I did not think of this, nor of the retrograde step from
separated sexes to an hermaphrodite state ; nor of the
lessened fertility of the monster. Proh pudor to me.
The world would say what a lawyer has been lost in a mere

I am so heartily pleased to see that you approve of the
chapter on Classification.
I wonder what Harvey will say. But no one hardly, I think,
is able at first to see when he is beaten in an argument.
[The following letters refer to the first translation (i860) of
the  Origin of Species  into German, which was superintended
by H. G. Bronn, a good zoologist and palseontologist,' who
was at the time at Freiburg, but aftenvards Professor at
Heidelberg. I have been told that the translation was not a
success, it remained an obvious translation, and was cor-
respondingly unpleasant to read. Bronn added to the trans-
lation an appendix on the difficulties that occurred to him.
For instance, how can natural selection account for differences
between species, when these differences appear to be of no
service to their possessors; e.g., the length of the ears and
tail, or the folds in the enamel of the teeth of various species
of rodents? Krause, in his book, Charles Darwin, p. 91,
criticises Bronns conduct in this matter, but it will be seen
that my father actually suggested the addition of Bronns

Krause (op. cit. p. 87) is that he left out passages of which he
did not approve, as, for instance, the passage ( Origin, first

and his history. I have no evidence as to whether my
father did or did not know of these alterations.]

Schweitzerbart that I give up all right to profit for myself, so
that I hope a translation will appear. I fear that the book
will be difficult to translate, and if you could advise Schweit-

service. Still more, if you would run your eye over the more
difficult parts of the translation ; but this is too great a favour
to expect I feel sure that it will be difficult to translate,

cordially for your extreme kindness in superintending the
translation. I have mentioned this to some eminent scientific
men, and they all agree that you have done a noble and
generous service. If I am proved quite wrong, yet I comfort
myself in thinking that my book may do some good, as truth
can only be known by rising victorious from every attack. I
thank you also much for the review, and for the kind manner
in which you speak of me. I send with this letter some cor-
rections and additions to M. Schweitzerbart, and a short
historical preface. I am not much acquainted with German
authors, as I read German very slowly ; therefore I do not
know whether any Germans have advocated similar views
with mine ; if they have, would you do me the favour to insert
a foot-note to the preface ? M. Schweitzerbart has now the
reprint ready for a translator to begin. Several scientific men
have thought the term  Natural Selection good, because its
meaning is not obvious, and each man could not put on it his
own interpretation, and because it at once connects variation
under domestication and nature. Is there any analogous
term used by German breeders of animals ?  Adelung,
ennobling, would, perhaps, be too metaphorical. It is folly in
me, but I cannot help doubting whether Wahl der Lebens-

mind of the Lamarckian doctrine (which I reject) of habits of
life being all-important. Man has altered, and thus improved
the English race-horse by selecting successive fleeter indi-
viduals ; and I believe, owing to the struggle for existence,
that similar slight variations in a wild horse, if advantageous
to it, would be selected or preserved by nature ; hence Natural
Selection. But I apologise for troubling you with these
remarks on the importance of choosing good German terms
for "Natural Selection. With my heartfelt thanks, and with
sincere respect,

paragraphs and final paragraph, and am perfectly contented,
indeed more than contented, with the generous and candid

with too much praise of my work. I shall, of course, care-

tive books like Gaertners pretty easily, when any reasoning
comes in, I find German excessively difficult to understand.
At some future time I should very much like to hear how my

hope M. Schweitzerbart will not lose money by the publica-

I fear my MS. for the, bigger book (twice or thrice as long
as in present book), with all references, would be illegible,
but it would save you infinite labour ; of course I would
gladly lend it, but I have no copy, so care would have to be
taken of it. But my accursed handwriting would be fatal.
About breeding, I know of no one book. I did not think
well of Lowe, but I can name none better. Youatt I look at
as a far better and more practical authority ; but then his views
and facts are scattered through three or four thick volumes.
I have picked up most by reading really numberless special
treatises and all agricultural and horticultural journals ; but
it is a work of long years. The difficulty is to know what to
trust. No one or two statements are worth a farthing; the
facts are so complicated. I hope and think I have been
really cautious in what I state on this subject, although all
that I have given, as yet, is far too briefly. I have found it
very important associating with fanciers and breeders. For
instance, I sat one evening in a gin palace in the Borough
amongst a set of pigeon fanciers, when it was hinted that
Mr. Bull had crossed his Pouters with Runts to gain size ; and
* This caution is exemplified in
the following extract from an earlier
letter to Professor Huxley ;   The
inaccuracy of the blessed gang (of
which 1 am one) of compilers passes
all bounds. Monsters have fre-

without a tittle of evidence. I must
give one other case to show how
we jolly fellows work. A Belgian
Baron (I forget his name at this
moment) crossed two distinct geese
and got seven hybrids, , which he
proved subsequently to be quite
sterile ; well, compiler the first,
Chevreul, says that the hybrids were
inter se. Compiler second (Morton)
mistakes the French name, and
gives latin names for two more
distinct geese, and says Chevreul
himself propagated them inter se
for seven generations ; and the latter
statement is copied from book to
book.

if you had seen the solemn, the mysterious, and awful shakes
of the head which all the fanciers gave at this scandalous
proceeding, you would have recognised how little crossing
has had to do with improving breeds, and how dangerous for
endless generations the process was. All this was brought
home far more vividly than by pages of mere statements, &c.
But I am scribbling foolishly. I really do not know how to
advise about getting up facts on breeding and improving
breeds. Go to Shows is one way. Read all treatises on any
one domestic animal, and believe nothing without largely
confirmed. For your lectures I can give you a few amusing
anecdotes and sentences, if you want to make the audience
laugh.
I thank you particularly for telling me what naturalists

being one of the earliest, as well as one of the most eloquent,
of his utterances in support of the  Origin of Species  :
 I have said that the man of science is the sworn inter-
preter of nature in the high court of reason. But of what
avail is his honest speech, if ignorance is the assessor of the
judge, and prejudice the foreman of the jury? I hardly know

of a great physical truth, whose universal reception has not
been preceded by an epoch in which most estimable per-
sons have maintained that the phenomena investigated were
directly dependent on the Divine Will, and that the attempt
to investigate them was not only futile, but blasphemous.
And there is a wonderful tenacity of life about this sort of
opposition to physical science. Crushed and maimed in every
battle, it yet seems never to be slain ; and after a hundred
defeats it is at this day as rampant, though happily not so
mischievous, as in the time of Galileo.
 But to those whose life is spent, to use Newtons noble
words, in picking up here a pebble and there a pebble on the
shores of the great ocean of truth  ^who watch, day by day,
the slow but sure advance of that mighty tide, bearing on its
bosom the thousand treasures wherewith man ennobles and
beautifies his life  it would be laughable, if it were not so sad,
to see the little Canutes of the hour enthroned in solemn
state, bidding that great wave to stay, and threatening to
check its beneficent progress. The wave rises and they fly ;
but, unlike the brave old Dane, they learn no lesson of
humility : the throne is pitched at what seems a safe distance,
and the folly is repeated.
 Surely it is the duty of the public to discourage anything
of this kind, to discredit these foolish meddlers who think
they do the Almighty a service by preventing a thorough
study of His works.
 The Origin of Species is not the first, and it will not be
the last, of the great questions bom of science, which will
demand settlement from this generation. The general mind
is seething strangely, and to those who watch the signs of the
times, it seems plain that this nineteenth century will see
revolutions of thought and practice as great as those which
the sixteenth witnessed. Through what trials and sore con-
tests the civilised world will have to pass in the course of this
new reformation, who can tell ?

 But I verily believe that come what will, the part which
England may play in the battle is a grand and a noble one.
She may prove to the world that, for one people, at any rate,
despotism and demagogy are not the necessary alternatives
of government ; that freedom and order are not incompatible ;
that reverence is the handmaid of knowledge ; that free
discussion is the life of truth, and of true unity in a nation.
Will England play this part? That depends upon how
you, the public, deal with science. Cherish her, venerate her,
follow her methods faithfully and implicitly in their applica-
tion to all branches of human thought, and the future of this
people will be greater than the past
 Listen to those who would silence and crush her, and I
fear our children will see the glory of England vanishing like
Arthur in the mist ; they will cry too late the woful cry of
Guinever :

thanks him for his kind manner of speaking about him. I
have also told him that he would be pleased to hear that the
Bishop of Oxford says it is the most unphilosophical * work
he ever read. The review seems to me clever, and only mis-
interprets me in a few places. Like all hostile men, he passes
over the explanation given of Classification, Morphology,
Embiyology, and Rudimentary Organs, &c. I read Wallaces

further confirmation. . . .

he is in much the same state as Bunbury,t and will go a very

My dear Gray,  I received about a week ago two sheets
of your Review ;f read them, and sent them to Hooker ; they
are now returned and re-read with care, and to-morrow I
send them to Lyell. Your Review seems to me admirable;
by far the best which I have read. I thank you from my
heart both for myself, but far more for the subjects sake.
Your contrast between the views of Agassiz and such as mine
is very curious and instructive.^ By the way, if Agassiz
writes anything on the subject, I hope you will tell me. I am
charmed with your metaphor of the streamlet never running
against the force of gravitation. Your distinction between
an hypothesis and theory seems to me very ingenious ; but I
do not think it is ever followed. Every one now speaks of the
undulatory theory of light ; yet the ether is itself hypothetical,
and the undulations are inferred only from explaining the
phenomena of light Even in the theory of gravitation is the
attractive power in any way known, except by explaining
the fall of the apple, and the movements of the Planets ? It
seems to mo that an hypothesis is developed into a theory
solely by explaining an ample lot of facts. Again and again I

Dear Sir,  I have to thank you for the unexpected
honour of your book. That the Naturalist whom, of all
naturalists living, I most wish to know and to learn from,
should have sent a scientist like me his book, encourages me
at least to observe more carefully, and think more slowly.
I am so poorly (in brain), that I fear I cannot read your
book just now as I ought All I have seen of it awes me ;
both with the heap of facts and tho prestige of your name,
and also with the clear intuition, that if you be right, I must
give up much that I have believed and written.

if we do but run into him at last.
From two common superstitions, at least, I shall be free
while judging of your book :
(i.) I have long since, from watching the crossing of
domesticated animals and plants, learnt to disbelieve the
dogma of the permanence of species.

(2.) I have gradually learnt to see that it is just as noble
a conception of Deity, to believe that He created primal
forms capable of self development into all forms needful pro
tempore and pro loco, as to believe that He required a fresh
act of intervention to supply the laatnas which He Himself
had made. I question whether the former be not the loftier
thought.
Be it as it may, I shall prize your book, both for itself,
and as a proof that you are aware of the existence of such a

 His views on this subject were very much to the same effect

on purely religious subjects are as sacredly private now as in
his life ; but the quaint conclusion of one may be given. We
had been speaking of the apparent contradiction of some sup-
posed discoveries with the Book of Genesis ; he said,  you
are (it would have been more correct to say you ought to be)
a theologian, I am a naturalist, the lines are separate. I en-
deavour to discover facts without considering what is said in
the Book of Genesis. I do not attack Moses, and I think

to read a little pamphlet which I received a couple of days
ago by a clergyman, you would laugh, and admit that I had
some excuse for bitterness. After abusing me for two or three
pages, in language sufficiently plain and emphatic to have
satisfied any reasonable man, he sums up by saying that he
has vainly searched the English language to find terms to
express his contempt for me and all Darwinians. In another
letter, after I had left Down, he writes,  We often differed,
but you are one of those rare mortals from whom one can
differ and yet feel no shade of animosity, and that is a thing

of me.
 CTTXTHR On my last visit to Down, Mr. Darwin said, at his dinner-
table, Brodie Innes and I have been fast friends for thirty
years, and we never thoroughly agreed on any subject but
once, and then we stared hard at each other, and thought one
of us must be very ill. ]

My dear Lyell,  That is a splendid answer of the father
of Judge Crampton. How curious that the Judge should have
hit on exactly the same points as yourself. It shows me what
a capital lawyer you would have made, how many unjust acts
you would have made appear just I But how much grander a
field has science been than the law, though the latter might
have made you Lord Kinnordy. I will, if there be another

chanced, I have used in letters this very same argument,
little knowing that any one had really thus objected to the law
of gravity. Newton answers by saying that it is philosophy
to make out the movements of a clock, though you do not
know why the weight descends to the ground. Leibnitz fur-
ther objected that the law of gravity was opposed to Natural
Religion ! Is this not curious ? I really think I shall use the
facts for some introductory remarks for my bigger book.
. . . You ask (I see) why we do not have monstrosities in
higher animals ; but when they live they are almost always
sterile (even giants and dwarfs are generally sterile), and we do
not know that Harveys monster would have bred. There is
I believe only one case on record of a peloric flower being
fertile, and I cannot remember whether this reproduced itself..
To recur to the eye. I really think it would have been dis-
honest, not to have faced the difficulty ; and worse (as Talley-
rand would have said), it would have been impolitic I think,
for it would have been thrown in my teeth, as H. Holland
threw the bones of the ear, till Huxley shut him up by showing
what a fine gradation occurred amongst living creatures.
I thank you much for your most pleasant letter.
Yours affectionately,
C. Darwin.
P.S.  I send a letter by Herbert Spencer, which you can
read or not as you think fit. He puts, to my mind, the
philosophy of the argument better than almost any one,
at the close of the letter. I could make nothing of Danas
idealistic notions about species ; but then, as Wollaston says,
I have not a metaphysical head.

The outsiders, as you say, are strong.
You say that you think that Bentham is touched, but,

was never admitted into his intimacy, and he therefore never
made any communications to me in relation to his views and
labours. I have been throughout one of his most sincere
admirers, and fully adopted his theories and conclusions,
notwithstanding the severe pain and disappointment they at
first occasioned me. On the day that his celebrated paper
was read at the Linnean Society, July ist, 1858, a long paper
of mine had been set down for reading, in which, in com-
menting on the British Flora, I had collected a number of
observations and facts illustrating what I then believed to be
a fixity in species, however difficult it might be to assign their
limits, and showing a tendency of abnormal forms produced
by cultivation or otherwise, to withdraw within those original
limits when left to themselves. Most fortunately my paper
had to give way to Mr. Darwins, and when once that was
read, I felt bound to defer mine for reconsideration ; I began
to entertain doubts on the subject, and on the appearance of
the  Origin of Species, I was forced, however reluctantly, to
give up my long-cherished convictions, the results of much
labour and study, and I cancelled all that part of my paper
which urged original fixity, and published only portions of
the remainder in another form, chiefly in the Natural History
Review. I have since acknowledged on various occasions
my full adoption of Mr. Danvins views, and chiefly in my
Presidential Address of 1863, and in my thirteenth and last
address, issued in the form of a report to the British Associa-
tion at its meeting at Belfast in 1874.
I prize so highly the letters that I have of Mr. Danvins,
that I should feel obliged by your returning them to me when
you have done with them. Unfortunately I have not kept
the envelopes, and Mr. Darwin usually only dated them by
the month not by the year, so that they are not in any
chronological order.

Down [March] 12th [i860].
My dear Lyell,  Thinking over what we talked about,
the high state of intellectual development of the old Grecians
with the little or no subsequent improvement, being an appa-
rent difficulty, it has just occurred to me that in fact the case
harmonises perfectly with our views. The case would be a
decided difficulty on the Lamarckian or Vcstigian doctrine
of necessary progression, but on the view which I hold of
progression depending on the conditions, it is no objection at
all, and harmonises with the other facts of progression in
the corporeal structure of other animals. For in a state of
anarchy, or despotism, or bad government, or after irruption
of barbarians, force, strength, or ferocity, and not intellect,
would be apt to gain the day.
We have so enjoyed your and Lady Lyells visit

You may like to hear about reviews on my book. Sedg-
wick (as I and Lycll feel certain from internal evidence) has
reviewed me savagely and unfairly in the Spectator.* The
notice includes much abuse, and is hardly fair in several
respects. He would actually lead any one, who was ignorant
of geology, to suppose that I had invented the great gaps
between successive geological formations, instead of its being
an almost universally admitted dogma. But my dear old
friend Sedgwick, with his noble heart, is old, and is rabid with
indignation. It is hard to please every one ; you may
remember that in my last letter I asked you to leave out
about the Weald denudation : I told Jukes this (who is head
man of the Irish geological survey), and he blamed me much,
for he believed every word of it, and thought it not at all

review, namely, an opposed one (by Pictet,* the palaeontologist,
in the Bib. Universelle of Geneva) which is perfectly fair and
just, and I agree to every word he says ; our only difference
being that he attaches less weight to arguments in favour,
and more to arguments opposed, than I do. Of all the op-
posed reviews, I think this the only quite fair one, and I never
expected to see one. Please observe that I do not class your
review by any means as opposed, though you think so your-
self ! It has done me much too good service ever to appear
in that rank in my eyes. But I fear I shall weary you with
so much about my book. I should rather think there was a
good chance of my becoming the most egotistical man in all

doctrine, that the breaks between successive formations
marked long intervals of time. It is very unfair. But poor
dear old Sedgwick seems rabid on the question.  Demo-
ralised understanding !  If ever I talk with him I will tell
him that I never could believe that an inquisitor could be a
good man ; but now I know that a man may roast another,
and yet have as kind and noble a heart as Sedgwicks.
The following passages arc taken from the review :
 I need hardly go on any further with these objections.
But I cannot conclude without expressing my detestation of
the theory, because of its unflinching materialism ;  because
it has deserted the inductive track, the only track that leads
to physical truth ;  because it utterly repudiates final causes,
and thereby indicates a demoralised understanding on the
part of its advocates.
 Not that I believe that Darwin is an atheist ; though I
cannot but regard his materialism as atheistical. I think it
untrue, because opposed to the obvious course of nature, and
the very opposite of inductive truth. And I think it intensely
mischievous.
Each scries of facts is laced together by a series of
assumptions, and repetitions of the one false principle.
You cannot make a good rope out of a string of air
bubbles.
 But any startling and (supposed) novel paradox, main-
tained very boldly and with something of imposing plausi-
bility, produces in some minds a kind of pleasing excitement
which predisposes them in its favour ; and if they are unused
to careful reflection, and averse to the labour of accurate
investigation, they will be likely to conclude that what is
(apparently) original, must be a production of original genius,
and that anything very much opposed to prevailing notions
must be a grand discovery,  in short, that whatever comes

My dear Carpenter,  I have this minute finished your
review in the  Med. Chirurg. Review. f You must let me
express my admiration at this most able essay, and I hope to
God it will be largely read, for it must produce a great effect.
I ought not, however, to express such warm admiration, for
you give my book, I fear, far too much praise. But you have
gratified me extremely ; and though I hope I do not care
very much for the approbation of the non-scientific readers, I
cannot say that this is at all so with respect to such few men
as yourself. I have not a criticism to make, for I object to
not a word ; and I admire all, so that I cannot pick out one
part as better than the rest. It is all so well balanced. But
it is impossible not to be struck with your extent of knowledge
in geology, botany, and zoology. The extracts which you
give from Hooker seem to me excellently chosen, and most
forcible. I am so much pleased in what you say also about
Lyell. In fact I am in a fit of enthusiasm, and had better
write no more. With cordial thanks.
Yours very sincerely,
C. Darwin.

Down, April loth [iS6o].
My dear Lyell,  Thank you much for your note of the
4th ; I am very glad to hear that you are at Torquay. I should
have amused myself earlier by writing to you, but I have had
Hooker and Huxley staying here, and they have fully occupied
my time, as a little of anything is a full dose for me. . . .
There has been a plethora of reviews, and I am really quite
sick of myself. There is a very long review by Carpenter in
the Medical and Chirurg. Review, very good and well balanced,
but not brilliant. He discusses Hooker's books at as great
length as mine, and makes excellent extracts ; but I could not
get Hooker to feel the least interest in being praised.
Carpenter speaks of you in thoroughly proper terms. There
is a brilliant review by Huxley, * with capital hits, but I do
not know that he much advances the subject I think I have
convinced him that he has hardly allowed weight enough to
the case of varieties of plants being in some degrees sterile.
To diverge from reviews : Asa Gray sends me from Wyman
(who will write), a good case of ali the pigs being black in the
Everglades of Virginia. On asking about the cause, it seems
(I have got capital analogous cases) that when the black pigs
eat a certain nut their bones become red, and they suffer to a
certain extent, but that the white pigs lose their hoofs and
perish, " and we aid by selection, for we kill most of the young
white pigs. This was said by men who could hardly read.
By the way, it is a great blow to me that you cannot admit
the potency of natural selection. The more I think of it, the
less I doubt its power for great and small changes. I have
just read the  Edinburgh, t which without doubt is by

and very bitter against Hooker. So we three enjoyed it
together. Not that I really enjoyed it, for it made me
uncomfortable for one night ; but I have got quite over it
to-day. It requires much study to appreciate all the bitter
spite of many of the remarks against me ; indeed I did not
discover all myself. It scandalously misrepresents many
parts. He misquotes some passages, altering words within
inverted commas. . . .

Now for a curious thing about my book, and then I have
done. In last Saturdays Gardeners Chronicle j a Mr. Patrick
Matthew publishes a long extract from his work on  Naval
Timber and Arboriculture, published in 1831, in which he
briefly but completely anticipates the theory of Natural Selec-
tion. I have ordered the book, as some few passages arc
rather obscure, but it is certainly, I think, a complete but not
developed anticipation I Erasmus always said that surely
this would be shown to be the case some day. ' Anyhow, one
may be excused in not having discovered the fact in a work-
on Naval Timber.
I heartily hope that your Torquay work may be successful.
Give my kindest remembrances to Falconer, and I hope he is
pretty well. Hooker and Huxley (with Mrs. Huxley) were
extremely pleasant But poor dear Hooker is tired to death
of my book, and it is a marvel and a prodigy if you are not
worse tired  if that be possible. Farewell, my dear Lyell,

and if you think it full and ample enough, please alter the
date to the day on which you post it, and let that be soon.
The case in the Gardeners' Chronicle seems a little stronger
than in Mr. Matthews book, for the passages are therein
scattered in three places ; but it would be mere hair-splitting
to notice that. If you object to my letter, please return it
but I do not expect that you will, but I thought that you
would not object to run your eye over it. My dear Hooker,
it is a great thing for me to have so good, true, and old a
friend as you. I owe much for science to my friends.
Many thanks for Huxleys lecture. The latter part seemed
to be grandly eloquent.
... I have gone over [the  Edinburgh ] review again, and
compared passages, and I am astonished at the misrepre-
sentations. But I am glad I resolved not to answer. Perhaps
it is selfish, but to answer and think more on the subject is
too unpleasant I am so sorry that Huxley by my means
has been thus atrociously attacked. I do not suppose you
much care about the gratuitous attack on you.
* My father wrote {Gardener^

 I have been much interested by
Mr. Patrick Matthews communi-

ledge that Mr. Matthew has anti-
cipated by many years the ex-
planation which I have offered of
the origin of species, under the
name of natural selection. I think
that no one will feel surprised
that neither I, nor apparently any
other naturalist, had heard of Mr.
Matthews views, considering how
briefly they are given, and that
they appeared in the appendix to
a work on Naval Timber and
Arboriculture. I can do no more
than offer my apologies to Mr.
Matthew for my entire ignorance
of his publication. If another edi-
tion of my work is called for, I will
insert to the foregoing effect. In
spite of my fathers recognition of
his claims, Mr. Matthew remained
unsatisfied, and complained that
an article in the * Saturday An.ilyst

My dear Lyell,  I was very glad to get your nice long
letter from Torquay. A press of letters prevented me writing
to Wells. I was particularly glad to hear what you thought
about not noticing [the  Edinburgh ] review. Hooker and
Huxley thought it a sort of duty to point out the alteration of
quoted citations, and there is truth in this remark ; but I so
hated the thought that I resolved not to do so. I shall come
up to London on Saturday the 14th, for Sir B. Brodies party,
as I have an accumulation of things to do in London, and will
(if I do not hear to the contrary) call about a quarter before
ten on Sunday morning, and sit with you at breakfast, but
will not sit long, and so take up much of your time. I must say
one more word about our quasi-thcological controversy about
natural selection, and let me have your opinion when we meet
in London. Do you consider that the successive variations in
the size of the crop of the Pouter Pigeon, which man has accu-
mulated to please his caprice, have been due to the creative and
sustaining powers of Brahma ?  In the sense that an omni-
potent and omniscient Deity must order and know everything,
this must be admitted ; yet, in honest truth, I can hardly
admit it. It seems preposterous that a maker of a universe
should care about the crop of a pigeon solely to please mans
silly fancies. But if you agree with me in thinking such an
interposition of the Deity uncalled for, I can see no reason
whatever for believing in such interpositions in the case of
natural beings, in which strange and admirable peculiarities

have been naturally selected for the creatures own benefit
Imagine a Pouter in a state of nature wading into the water
and then, being buoyed up by its inflated crop, sailing about
in search of food. What admiration this would have excited
 adaptation to the laws of hydrostatic pressure, &c. &c. For
the life of me I cannot see any difficulty in natural selection
producing the most exquisite structure, if such structure can
be arrived at by gradation, and I know from experience how
hard it is to name any structure towards which at least some
gradations are not known.
Ever yours,
C. Darwin.
P.S.  The conclusion at which I have come, as I have told
Asa Gray, is that such a question, as is touched on in tliis
note, is beyond the human intellect, like  predestination and

Down, April 25th [i860].
My dear Gray,  I have no doubt I have to thank you
for the copy of a review on the  Origin  in the  North
American Review. It seems to me clever, and I do not
doubt will damage my book. I had meant to have made
some remarks on it ; but Lycll wished much to keep it, and
my head is quite confused between the many reviews which
I have lately read. I am sure the reviewer is wrong about
bees cells, i.e. about the distance ; any lesser distance would
do, or even greater distance, but then some of the places
would lie outside the generative spheres ; but this would
not add much difficulty to the work. The reviewer takes a
strange view of instinct : he seems to regard intelligence as
a developed instinct ; which I believe to be wholly false. I
suspect he has never much attended to instinct and the
minds of animals, except perhaps by reading.
My chief object is to ask you if you could procure for me
a copy of the New York Times for Wednesday, March 28th.
It contains a very striking review of my book, which I should
much like to keep. How curious that the two most striking
reviews {j.e. yours and this) should have appeared in America.
This review is not really useful, but somehow is impressive.
There was a good review in the  Revue des Deux Mondes,

from Henslow this morning, who says that Sedgwick was, on
last Monday night, to open a battery on me at the Cambridge
Philosophical Society. Anyhow, I am much honoured by
being attacked there, and at the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
I do not think it worth while to contradict single cases, nor
is it worth while arguing against those who do not attend to
what I state. A moments reflection will show you that there
must be (on our doctrine) large genera not varying (see p. 56
on the subject, in the second edition of the  Origin). Though
I do not there discuss the case in detail.
It may be sheer bigotry for my own notions, but I prefer to
the Atlantis, my notion of plants and animals having migra-
ted from the Old to the New World, or conversely, when
the climate was much hotter, by approximately the line of
Behrings Straits. It is most important, as you say, to see
living forms of plants going back so far in time. I wonder
whether we shall ever discover the flora of the dry land of
the coal period, and find it not so anomalous as the swamp
or coal-making flora. I am working away over the blessed

The imperfection of the Geological Record is, as you say, the
weakest of all ; but yet I am pleased to find that there are

more easily converted than simple naturalists, because more
accustomed to reasoning. Before telling you about the
progress of opinion on the subject, you must let me say how
I admire the generous manner in which you speak of my book.
Most persons would in your position have felt some envy or

surprise is at the greatness of the sale. No doubt the public

thinking that it would be nice easy reading. I expect the sale
to stop soon in England, yet Lyell wrote to me the other day
that calling at Murrays he heard that fifty copies had gone in

will notice in Silliman the additions in the Origin. Judging
from letters (and I have just seen one from Thwaites to

do not necessarily advance, how there can now be simple organ-

tion to write atheistically. But I own that I cannot see as
plainly as others do, and as I should wish to do, evidence of
design and beneficence on all sides of us. There seems to me
too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that
a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly
created the Ichneumonida: with the express intention of their
feeding within the living bodies of Caterpillars, or that a cat
should play with mice. Not believing this, I see no necessity
in the belief that the eye was expressly designed. On the
other hand, I cannot anyhow be contented to view this won-
derful universe, and especially the nature of man, and to
conclude that everything is the result of brute force. I am
inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws,
with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out
of what we may call chance. Not that this notion at all
satisfies me. I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too
profound for the human intellect A dog might as well
speculate on the mind of Newton. Let each man hope and
believe what he can. Certainly I agree with you that my
views are not at all necessarily atheistical. The lightning kills
a man, whether a good one or bad one, owing to the exces-
sively complex action of natural laws. A child (who may
turn out an idiot) is born by the action of even more complex
laws, and I can see no reason why a man, or other animal,
may not have been aboriginally produced by other laws, and
that all these laws may have been expressly designed by
an omniscient Creator, who foresaw every future event and
consequence. But the more I think the more bewildered I
become ; as indeed I have probably shown by this letter.
Most deeply do I feel your generous kindness and interest

says that I describe them as so believing, and this, surely, is a

My dear Hooker,  It is a pleasure to me to write to
you, as I have no one to talk about such matters as we write
on. But 1 seriously beg you not to write to me unless so
inclined ; for busy as you are, and seeing many people, the
case is very different between us. . . .
Have you seen s abusive article on me ? . . . It outdoes
even the North British and Edinburgh in misapprehension
and misrepresentation. I never knew anything so unfair as
in discussing cells of bees, his ignoring the case of Melipona,
which builds combs almost e.xactly intermediate beUveen hive
and humble bees. What has done that he feels so
immeasurably superior to all us wretched naturalists, and
to all political economists, including that great philosopher
Malthus? This review, however, and Harveys letter have
convinced me that I must be a very bad explainer. Neither
porting himself for a few years as a
writer on Field Natural History,
he ultimately went out to India as
Curator of the Museum of the R.
Asiatic Soc. of Beng<al, where the
greater part of his working life was
spent His chief publications were
the monthly reports made as part
of his duty to the Society. He had
stored in his remarkable memory a
wonderful wealth of knowledge,
especially with regard to the m.am-
malia and birds of India know-
ledge of which he freely gave to
those who asked. His letters to my
father give evidence of having been
carefully studied, and the long list
of entries after his name in the
index to Animals and Plants,
show how much help was received
from him. His life was an unpros-
perous and unhappy one, full of
money difficulties and darkened by
the death of his wife after a few
years of marriage.

really understand what I mean by Natural Selection. I am
inclined to give up the attempt as hopeless. Those who do
not understand, it seems, cannot be made to understand.
By the way, I think, we entirely agree, except perhaps that
I use too forcible language about selection. I entirely agree,
indeed would almost go further than you when you say that
climate (i.e. variability from all unknown causes) is "an active
handmaid, influencing its mistress most materially." Indeed,
I have never hinted that Natural Selection is  the efficient
cause to the exclusion of the other, i.e. variability from
Climate, &c. The very term selection implies something, i.e.
variation or difference, to be selected. . . .
How does your book progress (I mean your general sort of
book on plants), I hope to God you will be more successful
than I have been in making people understand your meaning.
I should begin to think myself wholly in the wrong, and that
I was an utter fool, but then I cannot yet persuade myself,
that Lyell, and you and Huxley, Carpenter, Asa Gray, and
Watson, &c, are all fools together. Well, time will show, and
nothing but time. Farewell. . . .

years the plainest case may be misrepresented and mis-
understood. I have read the  Future  ; how curious it is
that several of my reviewers should advance such wild
arguments, as that varieties of dogs and cats do not
mingle ; and should bring up the old exploded doctrine of
definite analogies ... I am beginning to despair of ever

pleased by the way he personally alludes to me. I must
be a very bad explainer. I hope to Heaven that you will
succeed better. Several reviews and several letters have
shown me too clearly how little I am understood. I suppose
 natural selection  was a bad term ; but to change it now,
I think, would make confusion worse confounded, nor can I
think of a better; Natural Preservation would not imply
a preservation of particular varieties, and would seem a
truism, and would not bring mans and natures selection
under one point of view. I can only hope by reiterated
explanations finally to make the matter clearer. If my MS.
spreads out, I think I shall publish one volume exclusively
on variation of animals and plants under domestication.
I want to show that I have not been quite so rash as many
suppose.
Though weary of reviews, I should like to see Lowell's
some time. ... I suppose Lowells difficulty about instinct is
the same as Bowens ; but it seems to me wholly to rest on
the assumption that instincts cannot graduate as finely as
structures. I have stated in my volume that it is hardly
possible to know which, i.e. whether instinct or structure,
change first by insensible steps. Probably sometimes instinct,
sometimes structure. When a British insect feeds on an
exotic plant, instinct has changed by very small steps, and
their structures might change so as to fully profit by the
new food. Or structure might change first, as the direction
of tusks in one variety of Indian elephants, which leads it to
attack the tiger in a different manner from other kinds of
elephants. Thanks for your letter of the 2nd, chiefly about

I do not quite understand what you mean by saying,  that
the more they prove that you underrate physical conditions,
the better for you, as Geology comes in to your aid.
... I see in Murray and many others one incessant fallacy,
when alluding to slight differences of physical conditions as
being very important ; namely, oblivion of the fact that all
species, except very local ones, range over a considerable
area, and though exposed to what the world calls considerable
diversities, yet keep constant. I have just alluded to this in
the Origin in comparing the productions of the Old and
the New Worlds. Farewell, shall you be at Oxford ? If H.

. . . Lowells review  is pleasantly written, but it is clear that
he is not a naturalist. He quite overlooks the importance of
the accumulation of mere individual differences, and which, I
think I can show, is the great agency of change under
domestication. I have not finished Schaaffhausen, as I read
German so badly. I have ordered a copy for myself, and
should like to keep yours till my own arrives, but will return
it to you instantly if wanted. He admits statements rather
rashly, as I dare say I do. I see only one sentence as yet at
all approaching natural selection.
There is a notice of me in the penultimate number of  All

interesting and consolatory to me.

As squared stone, or bricks, or timber, are the indispensable
materials for a building, and influence its character, .so is
variability not only indispensable but influential. Yet in the
same manner as the architect is the all important person

[The meeting of the British Association at Oxford in i860
is famous for two pitched battles over the  Origin of Species.
Both of them originated in unimportant papers. On Thurs-
day, June 28, Dr. Daubeny of Oxford made a communication
to Section D : On the final causes of the sexuality of plants,
with particular reference to Mr. Darwin's work on the  Origin
of Species.  Mr. Huxley was called on by the President, but
tried (according to the A thenmum report) to avoid a discus-
sion, on the ground  that a general audience, in which senti-
ment would unduly interfere with intellect, was not the public
before which such a discussion should be carried on. How-
ever, the subject was not allowed to drop. Sir R. Owen
(I quote from the Atheneeum, July 7, i860), who wished to
approach this subject in the spirit of the philosopher, ex-
pressed his  conviction that there were facts by which the
public could come to some conclusion with regard to the pro-
babilities of the truth of Mr. Darwins theory. He went on to
say that the brain of the gorilla presented more differences,
as compared with the brain of man, than it did when com-
pared with the brains of the very lowest and most proble-
matical of the Quadrumana. Mr. Huxley replied, and
gave these assertions a direct and unqualified contradic-
tion, pledging himself to justify that unusual procedure
elsewhere,  a pledge which he amply fulfilled.f On Friday
there was peace, but on Saturday 30th, the battle arose with

redoubled fury over a paper by Dr. Draper of New York,
on the  Intellectual development of Europe considered with
reference to the views of Mr. Darwin.
The following account is from an eye-witness of the scene.
 The excitement was tremendous. The Lecture-room, in
which it had been arranged that the discussion should be held,
proved far too small for the audience, and the meeting ad-
journed to the Library of the Museum, which was crammed
to suffocation long before the champions entered the lists.
The numbers were estimated at from 700 to lOOO. Had it
been term-time, or had the general public been admitted, it
would have been impossible to have accommodated the rush to
hear the oratory of the bold Bishop. Professor Henslow, the
President of Section D, occupied the chair, and wisely an-
nounced in limine that none who had not valid arguments to
bring forward on one side or the other, would be allowed to
address the meeting : a caution that proved necessary, for no
fewer than four combatants had their utterances burked by
him, because of their indulgence in vague declamation.
"The Bishop was up to time, and spoke for full half-an-
hoUr with inimitable spirit, emptiness and unfairness. It was
evident from his handling of the subject that he had been
crammed  up to the throat, and that he knew nothing at first
hand ; in fact, he used no argument not to be found in his
 Quarterly  article. He ridiculed Darwin badly, and Huxley
savagely, but all in such dulcet tones, so persuasive a manner,
and in such well-turned periods, that I who had been inclined
to blame the President for allowing a discussion that could
serve no scientific purpose, now forgave him from the bottom
of my heart. Unfortunately the Bishop, hurried along on the
current of his own eloquence, so far forgot himself as to push
his attempted advantage to the verge of personality in a tell-
ing passage in which he turned round and addressed Huxley :
I forget the precise words, and quote from Lyell. The
Bishop asked whether Huxley was related by his grand-

fathers or grandmothers side to an ape.* Huxley replied to
the scientific argument of his opponent with force and elo-
quence, and to the personal allusion with a self-restraint, that
gave dignity to his crushing rejoinder."
Many versions of Mr. Huxleys speech were current : the
following report of his conclusion is from a letter addressed
by the late John Richard Green, then an undergraduate, to
a fellow-student, now Professor Boyd Dawkins. " I asserted,
and I repeat, that a man has no reason to be ashamed of
having an ape for his grandfather. If there were an ancestor
whom I should feel shame in recalling, it would be a man, a
man of restless and versatile intellect, who, not content with
an equivocal t success in his own sphere of activity, plunges
into scientific questions with which he has no real acquaint-
ance, only to obscure them by an aimless rhetoric, and dis-
tract the attention of his hearers from the real point at issue
by eloquent digressions, and skilled appeals to religious
prejudice. t
The letter above quoted continues :
 The excitement was now at its height ; a lady fainted and
had to be carried out, and it was some time before the dis-
cussion was resumed. Some voices called for Hooker, and
his name having been handed up, the President invited him to
give his view of the theory from the Botanical side. This he
did, demonstrating that the Bishop, by his own showing, had
never grasped the principles of the  Origin, and that he was
absolutely ignorant of the elements of botanical science. The
Bishop made no reply, and the meeting broke up.
 There was a crowded conversazione in the evening at the
 Lydls  Letters, vol. ii. p. 335.

has a distinct recollection of the
scene, does not remember the word
equivocal. He believes, too, that

is slightly incorrect

My dear Hooker,  I have just received your letter. I
have been very poorly, with almost continuous bad headache
for forty-eight hours, and I was low enough, and thinking
what a useless burthen I was to myself and all others, when
your letter came, and it has so cheered me ; your kindness
and affection brought tears into my eyes. Talk of fame,
honour, pleasure, wealth, all are dirt compared with affection ;
and this is a doctrine with which, I know, from your letter,
that you will agree with from the bottom of your heart
. . . How I should have liked to have wandered about
Oxford with you, if I had been well enough ; and how still
more I should have liked to have heard you triumphing
over the Bishop. I am astonished at your success and
audacity. It is something unintelligible to me how any one
can argue in public like orators do. - I had no idea you had
this power. I have read lately so many hostile views, that I
was beginning to think that perhaps I was wholly in the
wrong, and that was right when he said the whole subject
would be forgotten in ten years ; but now that I hear that you
and Huxley will fight publicly (which I am sure I never
could do), I fully believe that our cause will, in the long-
run, prevail. I am glad I was not in Oxford, for I should
have been overwhelmed, with my [health] in its present state.

.... I had a letter from Oxford, written by Hooker late
on Sunday night, giving me some account of the awful battles
which have raged about species at Oxford. He tells me you
fought nobly with Owen (but I have heard no particulars),
and that you answered the B. of O. capitally. I often think
that my friends (and you far beyond others) have good cause
to hate me, for having stirred up so much mud, and led them
into so much odious trouble. If I had been a friend of
myself, I should have hated me. (How to make that sentence
good English, I know not) But remember, if I had not
stirred up the mud, some one else certainly soon would. I
honour your pluck ; I would as soon have died as tried to
answer the Bishop in such an assembly. . . .

As Hooker lately said in a note to me, you are more than
any one else the thorough master of the subject. I declare
that you know my book as well as I do myself ; and bring
to the question new lines of illustration and argument in a
manner which excites my astonishment and almost my envy !
I admire these discussions, I think, almost more than your
article in Sillimans Journal. Every single word seems
weighed carefully, and tells like a 32-pound shot. It makes
me much wish (but I know that you have not time) that
you could write more in detail, and give, for instance, the
facts on the variability of the American wild fruits. The
Atheneeum has the largest circulation, and I have sent my
copy to the editor with a request that he would republish
the first discussion ; I much fear he will not, as he reviewed

Fraser is thought the best which has appeared against us.
I believe that Hopkins is so much opposed because his course

know who is the author. I shall be very curious to hear on
your return whether Bronns German translation of the
 Origin  has drawn any attention to the subject. Huxley
is eager about a  Natural History Review, which he and
others are going to edit, and he has got so many first-rate
assistants, that I really believe he will make it a first-rate
production. I have been doing nothing, except a little
botanical work as amusement. I shall hereafter be very

Huxley, and Asa Gray, I see, are determined to stick to the
battle and not give in ; I am fully convinced that whenever
you publish, it will produce a great effect on all trimmers, and
on many others. By the way I forgot to mention Daubeny's
pamphlet,* very liberal and candid, but scientifically weak.
I believe Hooker is going nowhere this summer ; he is ex-
cessively busy . . . He has written me many, most nice
letters. I shall be very curious to hear on your return some
account of your Geolc^ical doings. Talking of Geology, you
used to be interested about the  pipes  in the chalk. About
three years ago a perfectly circular hole suddenly appeared
in a flat grass field to everyones astonishment, and was filled
up with many waggon loads of earth ; and now two or three
days ago, again it has circularly subsided about two feet
more. How clearly this shows what is still slowly going on.
This morning I recommenced work, and am at dogs ; when
I have written my short discussion on them, I will have it
copied, and if you like, you can then see how the argument
stands, about their multiple origin. As you seemed to think
this important, it might be worth your reading ; though I do
not feel sure that you will come to the same probable con-
clusion that I have done. By the way, the Bishop makes a
very telling case against me, by accumulating several instances
where I speak very doubtfully ; but this is very unfair, as in
such cases as this of the dog, the evidence is and must be
very doubtful. . . .

article, from the Atlantic Monthly, I am very glad to
possess. By the way, the editor of the At/tenseum* has
inserted your answer to Agassiz, Bowen, and Co., and when
I therein read them, I admired them even more than at first
They really seemed to me admirable in their condensation,
force, clearness and novelty.
I am surprised that Agassiz did not succeed in writing
something better. How absurd that logical quibble   if
species do not exist, how can they vary .> " As if any one
doubted their temporary existence. How coolly he assumes
that there is some clearly defined distinction between indi-
vidual differences and varieties. It is no wonder that a man
who calls identical forms, when found in two countries, dis-
tinct species, cannot find variation in nature. Again, how
unreasonable to suppose that domestic varieties selected by
man for his own fancy (p. 147) should resemble natural
varieties or species. The whole article seems to me poor ; it
seems to me hardly worth a detailed answer (even if I could
do it, and I much doubt whether I possess your skill in
picking out salient points and driving a nail into them), and
indeed you have already answered several points. Agassizs
name, no doubt, is a heavy weight against us. . . .
If you sec Professor Parsons, will you thank him for the
extremely liberal and fair spirit in which his Essay t is written.
Please tell him that I reflected much on the chance of favour-
able monstrosities {i.e. great and sudden variation) arising. I
have, of course, no objection to this, indeed it would be a great
aid, but I did not allude to the subject, for, after much labour,
I could find nothing which satisfied me of the probability of
such occurrences. There seems to me in almost every case
too much, too complex, and too beautiful adaptation, in every
structure to believe in its sudden production. I have alluded
under the head of beautifully hooked seeds to such possi-
bility. Monsters are apt to be sterile, or not to transmit

monstrous peculiarities. Look at the fineness of gradation in
the shells of successive sub-stages of the same great forma-
tion ; I could give many other considerations which made me
doubt such view. It holds, to a certain extent, with domestic
productions no doubt, where man preserves some abrupt
change in structure. It amused me to see Sir R. Murchison
quoted as a judge of affinities of animals, and it gave me a
cold shudder to hear of any one speculating about a true
crustacean giving birth to a true fish !

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to C. Lyell.
Down, September ist [i860].
My dear Lyell,  I have been much interested by your
letter of the 28th, received this morning. It has delighted me,
because it demonstrates that you have thought a good deal
lately on Natural Selection. Few things have surprised me
more than the entire paucity of objections and difficulties
new to me in the published reviews. Your remarks are of
a different stamp and new to me. I will run through them,
and make a few pleadings such as occur to me.
I put in the possibility of the Galapagos having been con-
timwusly joined to America, out of mere subservience to the
many who believe in Forbess doctrine, and did not see the
danger of admission, about small mammals surviving there
in such case. The case of the Galapagos, from certain facts
on littoral sea-shells (viz. Pacific Ocean and South American
littoral species), in fact convinced me more than in any other
case of other islands, that the Galapagos had never been

continuously united with the mainland ; it was mere base
subservience, and terror of Hooker and Co.
With respect to atolls, I think mammals would hardly
survive very long, even if the main islands (for as I have
said in the Coral Book, the outline of groups of atolls
do not look like a former continent) had been tenanted by
mammals, from the extremely small area, the very peculiar
conditions, and the probability that during subsidence all or
nearly all atolls have been breached and flooded by the sea
many times during their existence as atolls.
I cannot conceive any existing reptile being converted into
a mammal. From homologies I should look at it as certain
that all mammals had descended from some single pro-
genitor. What its nature was, it is impossible to speculate.
More like, probably, the Omithorhynchus or Echidna than any
known form ; as these animals combine reptilian characters
(and in a lesser degree bird character) with mammalian. We
must imagine some form as intermediate, as is Lepidosiren
now, between reptiles and fish, between mammals and
birds on the one hand (for they retain longer the same em-
bryological character) and reptiles on the other hand. With
respect to a mammal not being developed on any island,
besides want of time for so prodigious a development, there
must have arrived on the island the necessary and peculiar
progenitor, having a character like the embryo of a mammal ;
and not an already developed reptile, bird or fish.
We might give to a bird the habits of a mammal, but
inheritance would retain almost for eternity some of the bird-
like structure, and prevent a new creature ranking as a true
mammal.
I have often speculated on antiquity of islands, but not
with your precision, or at all under the point of view of
Natural Selection not having done what might have been
anticipated. The argument of littoral Miocene shells at the
Canary Islands is new to me. I was deeply impressed (from
336

[1 86a
the amount of the denudation) [with the] antiquity of St.
Helena, and its age agrees with the peculiarity of the flora.
With respect to bats at New Zealand (N.B. There are two or
three European bats in Madeira, and I think in the Canary
Islands) not having given rise to a group of non-volant bats,
it is, now you put the case, surprising ; more especially as
the genus of bats in New Zealand is very peculiar, and there-
fore has probably been long introduced, and they now speak
of Cretacean fossils there. But the first necessary step has to
be shown, namely, of a bat taking to feed on the ground, or
anyhow, and anywhere, except in the air. I am bound to
confess I do know one single such fact, viz. of an Indian species
killing frogs. Observe, that in my wretched Polar Bear case,
I do show the first step by which conversion into a whale
 would be easy,  would offer no difficulty  I ! So with seals,
I know of no fact showing any the least incipient variation of
seals feeding on the shore. Moreover, seals wander much ;
I searched in vain, and could not find otie case of any species
of seal confined to any islands. And hence wanderers would
be apt to cross with individuals undergoing any change on an
island, as in the case of land birds of Madeira and Bermuda.
The same remark applies even to bats, as they frequently
come to Bermuda from the mainland, though about 600 miles
distant. With respect to the Amblyrhynchus of the Gala-
pagos, one may infer as probable, from marine habits being
so rare with Saurians, and from the terrestrial species being
confined to a few central islets, that its progenitor first arrived
at the Galapagos ; from what country it is impossible to say,
as its affinity I believe is not very clear to any known species.
The offspring of the terrestrial species was probably rendered
marine. Now in this case I do not pretend I can show
variation in habits ; but we have in the terrestrial species a
vegetable feeder (in itself a rather unusual circumstance),
largely on lichens, and it would not be a great change for
its offspring to feed first on littoral algae and then on sub-

marine algae. I have said what I can in defence, but yours
is a good line of attack. We should, however, always re-
member that no change will ever be effected till a variation
in the habits or structure or of both chance to occur in the
right direction, so as to give the organism in question an
advantage over other already established occupants of land
or water, and this may be in any particular case indefinitely
long. I am very glad you will read my dogs MS., for it will
be important to me to see what you think of the balance of
evidence. After long pondering on a subject it is often
hard to judge. With hearty thanks for your most interesting

am amazed at your spirit. For Gods sake do not go and get

.... You will be weary of my praise, but it* does strike
me as quite admirably argued, and so well and pleasantly
written. Your many metaphors are inimitably good. I said
in a former letter that you were a lawyer, but I made a gross
mistake, I am sure that you are a poet No, by Jove, I will
tell you what you are, a hybrid, a complex cross of lawyer,
poet, naturalist and theologian ! Was there ever such a

I have just looked through the passages which I have
marked as appearing to me extra good, but I see that they
are too numerous to specify, and this is no exa^eration. My
eye just alights on the happy comparison of the colours of
the prism and our artiRcial groups. I see one little error of
fossil cattle in South America.
It is curious how each one, I suppose, weighs arguments in
a different balance : embryology is to me by far the strongest
single class of facts in favour of change of forms, and not one,
I think, of my reviewers has alluded to this. Variation not
coming on at a very early age, and being inherited at not
a very early corresponding period, explains, as it seems to
me, the grandest of all facts in natural history, or rather in
zoology, viz. the resemblance of embryos.

Down, September 13th [i860].
My dear Lyell,  I never thought of showing your letter
to any one. I mentioned in a letter to Hooker that I had
been much interested by a letter of yours with original objec
tions, founded chiefly on Natural Selection not having done
so much as might have been expected In your letter
just received, you have improved your case versus Natural
Selection ; and it would tell with the public (do not be
tempted by its novelty to make it too strong) ; yet it seems
to me, not really very killing, though I cannot answer your
case, especially, why Rodents have not become highly de-
veloped in Australia. You must assume that they have
inhabited Australia for a very long period, and this may or
may not be the case. But I feel that our ignorance is so
profound, why one form is preserved with nearly the same
structure, or advances in organisation or even retrogrades, or
becomes extinct, that I cannot put very great weight on the
difficulty. Then, as you say often in your letter, we know
not how many geolc^ical ages it may have taken to make any
great advance in organisation. Remember monkeys in the
Eocene formations : but I admit that you have made out an
excellent objection and difficulty, and I can give only un-
satisfactory and quite vague answers, such as you have
yourself put ; however, you hardly put weight enough on
the absolute necessity of variations first arising in the right
direction, videlicet, of seals beginning to feed on the shore.
I entirely agree with what you say about only one species
of many becoming modified. I remember tliis struck me
Z 2

much when tabulating the varieties of plants, and I have a
discussion somewhere on this point. It is absolutely implied
in my ideas of classification and divergence that only one or
two species, of even large genera, give birth to new species ;
and many whole genera become ivholly extinct .... Please
see p. 341 of the Origin. But I cannot remember that I
have stated in the  Origin  the fact of only very few species
in each genus varying. You have put the view much better
in your letter. Instead of saying as I often have, that very
few species vary at the same time, I ought to have said, that
very few species of a genus ever vary so as to become modified ;
for this is the fundamental explanation of classification, and
is shown in my engraved diagram. . . .
I quite agree with you on the strange and inexplicable fact
of Omithorhynchus having been preserved, and Australian
Trigonia, or the Silurian Lingula. I always repeat to myself
that we hardly know why any one single species is rare or
common in the best-known countries. I have got a set of
notes somewhere on the inhabitants of fresh water ; and it
is singular how many of these are ancient, or intermediate
forms ; which I think is explained by the competition having
been less severe, and the rate of change of organic forms
having been slower in small confined areas, such as all the
fresh waters make compared with sea or land.
I see that you do allude in the last page, as a difficulty, to
Marsupials not having become Placentals in Australia ; but
this I think you have no right at all to e.xpect ; for we ought
to look at Marsupials and Placentals as having descended
from some intermediate and lower form. The argument of
Rodents not having become highly developed in Australia
(supposing that they have long existed there) is much stronger.
I grieve to see you hint at the creation  of distinct successive
types, as well as of a certain number of distinct aboriginal
types. Remember, if you admit this, you give up the em-
bryological argument (Jhe weightiest of all to me), and the

My dear Lyell,  I got your letter of the i8th just before
starting here. You speak of saving me trouble in answering
Never think of this, for I look at every letter of yours as an
honour and pleasure, which is a pretty deal more than I can
say of some of the letters which I receive. I have now one
of 13 closely written folio pages to answer on species ! . . . .
I have a very decided opinion that all mammals must have
descended from a single parent. Reflect on the multitude of
details, very many of them of extremely little importance to
their habits (as the number of bones of the head, &c., covering
of hair, identical embryological development, &c. &c.). Now
this large amount of similarity I must look at as certainly
due to inheritance from a common stock. I am aware that
some cases occur in which a similar or nearly similar organ
has been acquired by independent acts of natural selection.
But in most of such cases of these apparently so closely
similar organs, some important homological difference may be
detected. Please read p. 193, beginning,  The electric organs,
342 THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES. [i860.
and trust me that the sentence,  In all these cases of two very
distinct species, 8:c. &c., was not put in rashly, for I went
carefully into every case. Apply this argument to the whole
frame, internal and external, of mammifers, and you will see
why I think so strongly that all have descended from one
progenitor. I have just re-read your letter, and I am not
perfectly sure that I understand your point.
I enclose two diagrams showing the sort of manner I conjec-
ture that mammals have been developed. I thought a little
on this when writing page 429, beginning,  Mr. Waterhouse.
(Please read the paragraph.) I have not knowledge enough
to choose between these hvo diagrams. If the brain of Mar-
supials in embryo closely resembles that of Placentals, I
should strongly prefer No. 2, and this agrees with the anti-
quity of Microlestes. As a general rule I should prefer No. l
diagram ; whether or not Marsupials have gone on being
developed, or rising in rank, from a very early period would
depend on circumstances too complex for even a conjecture.
Lingula has not risen since the Silurian epoch, whereas other
molluscs may have risen.
A, in the following diagrams, represents an unknown form,
probably Intermediate between Mammals, Reptiles and Birds,
as intermediate as Lepidosiren now is between Fish and
Batrachians. This unknown form is probably more closely
related to Ornithorhynchus than to any other known form.
I do not think that the multiple origin of dogs goes against
the single origin of man All the races of man are so
infinitely closer together than to any ape, that (as in the case
of descent of all mammals from one progenitor), I should look
at all races of men as having certainly descended from one
parent. I should look at it as probable that the races of men
were less numerous and less divergent formerly than now,
unless, indeed, some lower and more aberrant race even than
the Hottentot has become extinct Supposing, as' I do for
one believe, that our dogs have descended from two or three

wolves, jackals, &c ; yet these have, on our view, descended
from a single remote unknown progenitor. With domestic
dogs the question is simply whether the whole amount of
difference has been produced since man domesticated a single
species ; or whether part of the difference arises in the state
of nature. Agassiz and Co. think the negro and Caucasian
are now distinct species, and it is a mere vain discussion
whether, when they were rather less distinct, they would, on
this standard of specific value, deserve to be called species.

1 agree with your answer which you give to yourself on this
point ; and the simile of man now keeping down any new
man which might be developed, strikes me as good and new.
The white man is  improving off the face of the earth  even
races nearly his equals. With respect to islands, I think I would
trust to want of time alone, and not to bats and rodents.
N.B.  I know of no rodents on oceanic islands (except my
Galapagos mouse, which may have been introduced by man)
keeping down the development of other classes. Still much
more weight I should attribute to there being now, neither
in islands nor elsewhere, [any] known animals of a grade of
organisation intermediate between mammals, fish, reptiles,
&c., whence a new mammal could be developed. If every
vertebrate were destroyed throughout the world, except our
now well-established reptiles, millions of ages might elapse
before reptiles could become highly developed on a scale
equal to mammals ; and, on the principle of inheritance,
they would make some quite new class, and not mammals ;
though possibly more intellectual ! I have not an idea that
you will care for this letter, so speculative.

I cannot see yet how the multiple origin of dog can be
properly brought as argument for the multiple origin of man.
Is not your feeling a remnant of the deeply impressed one on
all our minds, that a species is an entity, something quite dis-
tinct from a variety ? Is it not that the dog case injures the
argument from fertility, so that one main argument that the
races of man are varieties and not species  i.e., because they
are fertile inter se, is much weakened ?
I quite agree with what Hooker says, that whatever varia-
tion is possible under culture, is possible under nature ; not that
the same form would ever be accumulated and arrived at by
selection for mans pleasure, and by natural selection for the
organisms own good.
Talking of natural selection; if I had to commence de

that I cannot explain why one rat has a longer tail and
another longer ears, &c. But he seems to muddle in assuming
that these parts did not all vary together, or one part so
insensibly before the other, as to be in fact contemporaneous.
I might ask the creationist whether he thinks these differences
in the two rats of any use, or as standing in some relation from
laws of growth ; and if he admits this, selection might come
into play. He who thinks that God created animals unlike

not admit any force in my argumentum ad hominem.
Bronn blunders about my supposing several Glacial periods,

My DEAR Sir,  I am extremely much obliged for your
letter, which I can compare only to a plum-pudding, so full
it is of good things. I have been rash about the cats : t yet
I spoke on what seemed to me, good authority. The Rev.
W. D. Fox gave me a list of cases of various foreign breeds in
which he had observed the correlation, and for years he had
vainly sought an exception. A French paper also gives
numerous cases, and one very curious case of a kitten which
gradually lost the blue colour in its eyes and as gradually
acquired its power of hearing. I had not heard of your uncle,
Mr. Kirbys case t (whom I, for as long as I can remember,
have venerated) of care in breeding cats. I do not know
whether Mr. Kirby was your uncle by marriage, but your
letters show me that you ought to have Kirby blood in your
veins, and that if you had not taken to languages you would

your advice on one point, and you know I think you the

It has occurred to me, that it would perhaps be a good plan
to put a set of notes (some twenty to forty or fifty) to the
 Origin, which now has none, exclusively devoted to errors
of my reviewers. It has occurred to me that where a reviewer
has erred, a common reader might err. Secondly, it will
show the reader that he must not trust implicitly to reviewers.

My dear Lyell,  I thank you much for your letter. I
had got to take pleasure in thinking how I could best .snub
my reviewers ; but I was determined, in any case, to follow
your advice, and, before I had got to the end of your letter, I
was convinced of the wisdom of your advice.* What an
advantage it is to me to have such friends as you. I shall
follow every hint in your letter exactly.
I have just heard from Murray ; he says he sold ycx) copies
at his sale, and that he has not half the number to supply ; so
that I must begin at once. 1 . . . .
P.S.  I must tell you one little fact which has pleased me.
You may remember that I adduce electrical organs of fish as
one of the greatest difficulties which have occurred to me, and
notices the passage in a singularly disingenuous spirit.
Well, McDonnell, of Dublin (a first-rate man), writes to me
that he felt the difficulty of the whole case as overwhelming
against me. Not only are the fishes which have electric
organs very remote in scale, but the organ is near the head in
some, and near the tail in others, and supplied by wholly
different nerves. It seems impossible that there could be any
transition. Some friend, who is much opposed to me, seems
to have crowed over McDonnell, who reports that he said to
himself, that if Darwin is right, there must be homologous
organs both near the head and tail in other non-electric fish.
  I get on slowly with my new
edition. I find that your ^vice

that my hypothetical notions should have led to pretty dis-

my doctrine, but that on the subjects which he knows well,
viz. Morphology and Embryology, my views accord well, and

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to Asa Gray.
Down, November 26th, i860.
My dear Gray,  I have to thank you for two letters. The
latter with corrections, written before you received my letter
asking for an American reprint, and saying that it was
hopeless to print your reviews as a pamphlet, owing to the
impossibility of getting pamphlets known. I am very glad
to say that the August or second Atlantic article has been
reprinted in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History  ;
but I have not yet seen it there. Yesterday I read over with
care the third article ; and it seems to me, as before, admi-
rable, But I grieve to say that I cannot honestly go as far
as you do about Design. I am conscious that I am in an
utterly hopeless muddle. I cannot think that the world, as
we see it, is the result of chance ; and yet I cannot look at
each separate thing as the result of Design. To take a
crucial example, you lead me to infer (p. 414) that you believe
 that variation has been led along certain beneficial lines." I
cannot believe this ; and I think you would have to believe,
that the tail of the Fantail was led to vary in the number
and direction of its feathers in order to gratify the caprice of
a few men. Yet if the Fantail had been a wild bird, and had

 What a beautiful and designed adaptation. Again, I say
I am, and shall ever remain, in a hopeless muddle.
Thank you much for Bowens 4to. review." The coolness
with which he makes all animals to be destitute of reason is
simply absurd. It is monstrous at p. 103, that he should
argue against the possibility of accumulative variation, and
actually leave out, entirely, selection I The chance that an
improved Short-horn, or improved Pouter-pigeon, should
be produced by accumulative variation without mans selec-
tion, is as almost infinity to nothing ; so with natural species
without natural selection. How capitally in the  Atlantic  you
show that Geology and Astronomy are, according to Bowen,
Metaphysics ; but he leaves out this in the 4to Memoir.
I have not much to tell you about my Book. I have just
heard that Du Bois-Rcymond agrees with me. The sale of my
book goes on well, and the multitude of reviews has not
stopped the sale . . . ; so I must begin at once on a new
corrected edition. I will send you a copy for the chance of
your ever re-reading ; but, good Heavens, how sick you must
be of it !

did at first This I consider rather ominous. Otherwise I
should be more contented with your degree of belief. I can
pretty plainly see that, if my view is ever to be generally
adopted, it will be by young men growing up and replacing
the old workers, and then young ones finding that they can
group facts and search out new lines of investigation better
on the notion of descent, than on that of creation. But

CHAPTER VIII.
THE SPREAD OF EVOLUTION.
1861-1862.
[The beginning of the year 1861 saw my father with the
third chapter of The Variation of Animals and Plants still
on his hands. It had been begun in the previous August,
and was not finished until March 1861. He was, however, for
part of this time (I believe during December i860 and
January 1861) engaged in a new edition (3000 copies) of the
 Origin, which was largely corrected and added to, and was
published in April 1861.
CTTXTHR With regard to this, the third edition, he wrote to Mr. Murray
in December i860:
 I shall be glad to hear when you have decided how many
copies you will print off the more the better for me in all
ways, as far as compatible with safety ; for I hope never again
to make so many corrections, or rather additions, which I
have made in hopes of making my many rather stupid
reviewers at least understand what is meant I hope and
think I shall improve the book considerably.
An interesting feature in the new edition was the His-
torical Sketch of the Recent Prc^ess of Opinion on the Origin
of Species  * which now appeared for the first time, and was
continued in the later editions of the work. It bears a strong

impress of the authors personal character in the obvious wish
to do full justice to all his predecessors,  ^though even in
this respect it has not escaped some adverse criticism.
Towards the end of the present year (l86i), the final
arrangements for the first French edition of the  Origin  were
completed, and in September a copy of the third English
edition was despatched to Mdlle. CMmence Royer, who under-
took the work of translation. The book was now spreading
on the Continent, a Dutch edition had appeared, and, as we
have seen, a German translation had been published in i860.
CTTXTHR In a letter to Mr. Murray (September 10, 1861), he wrote,
 My book seems exciting much attention in Germany,
judging from the number of discussions sent me. The
silence had been broken, and in a few years the voice of
German science was to become one of the strongest of the
advocates of evolution.
During all the early part of the year (1861) he was working
at the mass of details which are marshalled in order in the early
chapters of Animals and Plants. Thus in his Diary occur
the laconic entries,  May 16, Finished Fowls (eight weeks) ;
May 31, Ducks.
On July I, he started, with his family, for Torquay, where
he remained until August 27  a holiday which he characteris-
tically enters in his diary as " eight weeks and a day. The
house he occupied was in Hesketh Crescent, a pleasantly
placed row of houses close above the sea, somewhat removed
from what was then the main body of the town, and not far
from the beautiful cliffed coast-line in the neighbourhood of
Ansteys Cove.
During the Torquay holiday, and for the remainder of the
year, he worked at the fertilisation of orchids. This part of
the year 1861 is not dealt with in the present chapter, because
(as explained in the preface) the record of his life, as told in
his letters, seems to become clearer when the whole of his
botanical work is placed together and treated separately.

My dear Hooker,  I was delighted to get your long
chatty letter, and to hear that you are thawing towards
science. I almost wish you had remained frozen rather
longer ; but do not thaw too quickly and strongly. No one
can work long as you used to do. Be idle ; but I am a
pretty man to preach, for I cannot be idle, much as I wish it,
and am never comfortable except when at work. The word
holiday is written in a dead language for me, and much I

baseless, hopes.
.... With respect to the  Natural History Review  I can
hardly think that ladies would be so very sensitive about
 lizards guts but the publication is at present certainly
a sort of hybrid, and original illustrated papers ought hardly
to appear in a review. I doubt its ever paying ; but I shall
much regret if it dies. All that you say seems very sensible,

[CTTXTHR The following letter refers to Mr. Batess paper, Contri-
butions to an Insect Fauna of the Amazon Valley, in the
 Transactions of the Entomological Society. vol. 5, N.S.*
Mr. Ba'-es points out that with the return, after the glacial
period, of a warmer climate in the equatorial regions, the
 species then living near the equator would retreat north
and south to their former homes, leaving some of their con-
geners, slowly modified subsequently ... to re-people the zone
they had forsaken. In this case the species now living at
the equator ought to show clear relationship to the species
inhabiting the regions about the 25th parallel, whose distant
relatives they would of course be. But this is not the case,
and this is the difficulty my father refers to. Mr. Belt has
offered an explanation in his  Naturalist in Nicaragua
<1874), p. 266.  I believe the answer is that there was much
oxtermination during the glacial period, that many species
(and some genera, &c., as, for instance, the American horse),
did not survive it ... . but that a refuge was found for
many species on lands now below the ocean, that were
uncovered by the lowering of the sea, caused by the immense
quantity of water that was locked up in frozen masses on the
land.]

economy, and always carry away a dead fellow-creature as
food. But I have just fonvarded two most extraordinary

that they plant and cultivate a kind of grass for store food,
and plant other bushes for shelter ! I do not know what to

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to Thomas Davidson.
Down, April 26, 1861.
My dear Sir,  I hope that you will excuse me for ven-
turing to make a suggestion to you which I am perfectly well
aware it is a very remote chance that you would adopt I do
not know whether you have read my  Origin of Species  ; in
that book I have made the remark, which I apprehend will
be universally admitted, that ' as a whole, the fauna of any
formation is intermediate in character bebveen that of the
formations above and below. But several really good judges
have remarked to me how desirable it would be that this
should be exemplified and worked out in some detail
and with some single group of beings. Now every one will
admit that no one in the world could do this better than you
with Brachiopods. The result might turn out very unfavour-
able to the views which I hold ; if so, so much the better for
those who are opposed to me.f But I am inclined to suspect
that on the whole it would be favourable to the notion of
l86l.] DAVIDSON ON BRACHIOPODA. 367
Spirifers, &c., from three palaeozoic stages, and arranged them
in single and branching lines, with horizontal lines marking
the formations (like the diagram in my book, if you know
it), and the result seemed to me very striking, though I was
too ignorant fully to appreciate the lines of affinities. I
longed to have had these shells engraved, as arranged by
Mr. Salter, and connected by dotted lines, and would have
gladly paid the expense : but I could not persuade Mr. Salter
to publish a little paper on the subject. I can hardly doubt
that many curious points would occur to any one thoroughly
instructed in the subject, who would consider a group of
beings under this point of view of descent with modihcation.
All those forms which have come down from an ancient
period very slightly modified ought, I think, to be omitted,
and those forms alone considered which have undergone
considerable change at each successive epoch. My fear is
whether brachiopods have changed enough. The absolute
amount of difference of the forms in such groups at the
opposite extremes of time ought to be considered, and how
far the early forms are intermediate in character between
those which appeared much later in time. The antiquity of
a group is not really diminished, as some seem vaguely to
think, because it has transmitted to the present day closely
allied forms. Another point is how far the succession of each
genus is unbroken, from the first time it appeared to its
extinction, with due allowance made for formations poor in
fossils. I cannot but think that an important essay (far more
important than a hundred literary reviews) might be written
by one like yourself, and without very great labour. I know
it is highly probable that you may not have leisure, or not
care for, or dislike the subject, but I trust to your kindness
to forgive me for making this suggestion. If by any extra-
ordinary good fortune you were inclined to take up this
notion, I would ask you to read my Chapter X. on Geo-
logical Succession. And I should like in this case to be

Down, April 30, 1S61.
My dear Sir,  I thank you warmly for your letter ; I did
not in the least know that you had attended to my work. I
assure you that the attention which you have paid to it, con-
sidering your knowledge and the philosophical tone of your
mind (for I well remember one remarkable letter you wrote
to me, and have looked through your various publications),
I consider one of the highest, perhaps the very highest, com-
pliments which I have received. I live so solitary a life that
I do not often hear what goes on, and I should much like to
know in what work you have published some remarks on my
book. I take a deep interest in the subject, and I hope not
simply an egotistical interest ; therefore you may believe how
much your letter has gratified me ; I am perfectly contented
if any one will fairly consider the subject, whether or not he
fully or only very slightly agrees with me. Pray do not
think that I feel the least surprise at your demurring to a
ready acceptance ; in fact, I should not much respect anyones
judgment who did so : that is, if I may judge others from
the long time which it has taken me to go round. Each
stage of belief cost me years. The difficulties are, as you say,
many and very great ; but the more I reflect, the more they
seem to me to be due to our underestimating our Igpiorance.
I belong so much to old times that I find that I weigh

the difficulties from the imperfection of the geological
record, heavier than some of the younger men. I find, to
my astonishment and joy, that such good men as Ramsay,
Jukes, Geikie, and one old worker, Lyell, do not think that
I have in the least exaggerated the imperfection of the
record.* If my views ever are proved true, our current geo-
logical views will have to be considerably modified. My
greatest trouble is, not being able to weigh the direct effects
of the long-continued action of changed conditions of life
without any selection, with the action of selection on mere
accidental (so to speak) variability. I oscillate much on this
head, but generally return to my belief that the direct action
of the conditions of life have not been great. At least
this direct action can have played an extremely small part
in producing all the numberless and beautiful adaptations in
every living creature. With respect to a persons belief, what
does rather surprise me is that any one (like Carpenter)
should bo willing to go so very far as to believe that all birds
may have descended from one parent, and not go a little
farther and include all the members of the same great division ;
for on such a scale of belief, all the facts in Morphology and
in Embryology (the most important in my opinion of all sub-
jects) become mere Divine mockeries I cannot express
how profoundly glad I am that some day you will publish
your theoretical view on the modification and endurance of
 Professor Sedgwick treated this
part of the Origin of Species

been expected from his vehement
objection to Evolution in general.
In the article in the Spectator of

Sedgwick wrote: We know the
complicated organic phenomena of
the Mesozoic (or Oolitic) period.

[In Mr. Davidsons Monograph on British Brachiopoda^
published shortly afterwards by the Falxontographical Society,
results such as my father anticipated were to some extent
obtained. No less than fifteen commonly received species-
are demonstrated by Mr. Davidson by the aid of a long series
of transitional forms to appertain to . . . one type. *
In the autumn of i860, and the early part of 1861, my
father had a good deal of correspondence with Professor
Asa Gray on a subject to which reference has already been
made  the publication, in the form of a pamphlet, of Pro-
fessor Grays three articles in the July, August, and October
numbers of the Atlantic Monthly, i860. The pamphlet was
published by Messrs. Triibner, with reference to whom my
father wrote,  Messrs. Triibner have been most liberal and
kind, and say they shall make no charge for all their trouble.
I have settled about a few advertisements, and they will
gratuitously insert one in their own periodicals.
The reader will find these articles republished in Dr. Grays
 Darwiniana, p. 87, under the title Natural Selection not
inconsistent with Natural Theology. The pamphlet found
many admirers among those most capable of judging of its
merits, and my father believed that it was of much value in
lessening opposition, and making converts to Evolution. His.

high opinion of it is shown not only in his letters, but by the
fact that he inserted a special notice of it in a most prominent
place in the third edition of the Origin. Lyell, among
others, recognised its value as an antidote to the kind of
criticism from which the cause of Evolution suffered. Thus
my father wrote to Dr. Gray;  ^Just to exemplify the use
of your pamphlet, the Bishop of London was asking Lyell
what he thought of the review in the  Quarterly, and Lyell
answered, * Read Asa Gray in the Atlantic.  It comes out
very clearly that in the case of such publications as Dr. Grays,
my father did not rejoice over the success of his special view
of Evolution, viz. that modification is mainly due to Natural
Selection ; on the contrary, he felt strongly that the really
important point was that the doctrine of Descent should be
accepted. CTTXTHR Thus he wrote to Professor Gray (May ll, 1863),
with reference to Lyells  Antiquity of Man  :
 You speak of Lyell as a judge ; now what I complain of
is that he declines to be a judge .... I have sometimes
almost wished that Lyell had pronounced against me. When
I say  me, I only mean change of species by descent. That
seems to me the turning-point Personally, of course, I care
much about Natural Selection ; hut that seems to me utterly
unimportant, compared to the question of Creation or Modifi-

My dear Gray,  I was very glad to get your photograph :
I am expecting mine, which I will send off as soon as it

with the photographer. .... Since writing last, I have had
several letters full of the highest commendation of your Essay ;

doubt it has done the  Origin  much good. I have not yet
heard how it has sold. You will have seen a review in the

Gardener^ Chronicle. Poor dear Henslow, to whom I owe
much, is dying, and Hooker is with him. Many thanks for
two sets of sheets of your Proceedings. I cannot understand
what Agassiz is driving at. You once spoke, I think, of
Professor Bowen as a very clever man. I should have thought
him a singularly unobservant man from his writings. He
never can have seen much of animals, or he would have seen
the difference of old and wise dogs and young ones. His
paper about hereditariness beats everything. Tell a breeder
that he might pick out his worst individual animals and
breed from them, and hope to win a prize, and he would think
you . . . insane.
[Professor Henslow died on May l6, i86i, from a complica-
tion of bronchitis, congestion of the lungs, and enlargement
of the heart. His strong constitution was slow in giving way,
and he lingered for weeks in a painful condition of weakness,
knowing that his end was near, and looking at death with
fearless eyes. In Mr. Blomefields (Jenyns) Memoir of
Henslow (1862) is a dignified and touching description of
Prof. Sedgwicks farewell visit to his old friend. Sedg\vick
said afterwards that he had never seen a human being
whose soul was nearer heaven.
CTTXTHR My father wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker on hearing of Henslows
death,  I fully believe a better man never walked this earth.
He gave his impressions of Henslows character in Mr.
Blomefields  Memoir. In reference to these recollections he
wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker (May 30, 1861) :
 This morning I wrote my recollections and impressions of
character of poor dear Henslow about the year 1830. I liked
the job, and so have written four or five pages, now being
copied. I do not suppose you will use all, of course you can
chop and change as much as you like. If more than a sen-
tence is used, I should like to see a proof-page, as I never

my remarks may appear too trifling, but I thought it best to

you think fit.
 You will see that I have exceeded your request, but, as I
said when I began, I took, pleasure in writing my impression
of his admirable character."]
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to Asa Gray.
Down, June 5 [1861].
My dear Gray,  I have been rather extra busy, so have
been slack in answering your note of May 6th. I hope you
have received long ago the third edition of the  Origin. ....
I have heard nothing from Triibner of the sale of your Essay,
hence fear it has not been great ; I wrote to say you could
supply more. I sent a copy to Sir J. Herschel, and in his
new edition of his  Physical Geography  he has a note on
the  Origin of Species, and agrees, to a certain limited extent,
but puts in a caution on design  much like yours
I have been led to think more on this subject of late, and
grieve to say that I come to differ more from you. It is not
that designed variation makes, as it seems to me, my deity
 Natural Selection  superfluous, but rather from studying,
lately, domestic variation, and seeing what an enormous field
of undesigned variability there is ready for natural selection
to appropriate for any purpose useful to each creature.
I thank you much for sending me your review of Phillips.*
I remember once telling you a lot of trades which you ought
to have followed, but now I am convinced that you are a bom

Lyell does, who thinks it fearfully retrograde. I amused

it has had no appreciable means of sustenance for a month
and I am most anxious to get rid of the responsibility of
starving it longer. In your hands it will thrive and have a

and 29th, and Sept 2nd received this morning. I agree with
much of what you say, and I hope to God we English are
utterly wrong in doubting (i) whether the N. can conquer
the S. ; (2) whether the N. has many friends in the South, and
(3) whether you noble men of Massachusetts are right in
transferring your own good feelings to the men of Washing-
ton. Again I say I hope to God we are wrong in doubting
on these points. It is number (3) which alone causes Eng-
land not to be enthusiastic with you. What it may be in
Lancashire I know not, but in S. England cotton has nothing
whatever to do with our doubts. If abolition does follow
with your victory, the whole world will look brighter in my
eyes, and in many eyes. It would be a great gain even to
stop the spread of slavery into the Territories ; if that be
possible without abolition, which I should have doubted.
You ought not to wonder so much at Englands coldness,
when you recollect at the commencement of the war how
many propositions were made to get things back to the old
state with the old line of latitude. But enough of this, all
I can say is that Massachusetts and the adjoining States
have the full sympathy of every good man whom I see ;
and this sympathy would be extended to the whole Federal
States, if we could be persuaded that your feelings were at
all common to them. But enough of this. It is out of my
line, though I read every word of news, and formerly

Your question what would convince me of Design is a
poser. If I saw an angel come down to teach us good, and I
was convinced from others seeing him that I was not mad, I
should believe in design. If I could be convinced thoroughly
that life and mind was in an unknown way a function of other
imponderable force, I should be convinced. If man was
made of brass or iron and no way connected with any other
organism which had ever lived, I should perhaps be con-
vinced. But this is childish writing.

I have lately been corresponding with Lyell, who, I think,
adopts your idea of the stream of variation having been led
or designed. I have asked him (and he says he will hereafter
reflect and answer me) whether he believes that the shape of
my nose was designed. If he does I have nothing more to
say. If not, seeing what Fanciers have done by selecting
individual differences in the nasal bones of pigeons, I must
think that it is illogical to suppose that the variations, which
natural selection preserves for the good of any being, have
been designed. But I know that I am in the same sort of
muddle (as I have said before) as all the world seems to be
. in with respect to free will, yet with eveiything supposed to
have been foreseen or pre-ordained.

Down, Dec. 3 [i86i].
My dear Sir.  I thank you for your extremely interesting
letter, and valuable references, though God knows when I
shall come again to this part of my subject. One cannot of
course judge of style when one merely hears a paper,* but
yours seemed to me very clear and good. Believe me that I
estimate its value most highly. Under a general point of view,
I am quite convinced (Hooker and Huxley took the same
view some months ago) that a philosophic view of nature can
solely be driven into naturalists by treating special subjects
as you have done. Under a special point of view, I think you
have solved one of the most perplexing problems which
could be given to solve. I am glad to hear from Hooker

that the Linncan Society will give plates if you can get
drawings. . . .
Do not complain of want of advice during your travels ; I
dare say part of your great originality of views may be due to
the necessity of self-exertion of thought. I can understand
that your reception at the British Museum would damp
you ; they are a very good set of men, but not the sort to
appreciate your work. In fact I have long thought that
too much systematic work [and] description somehow blunts
the faculties. The general public appreciates a good dose of
reasoning, or generalisation, with new and curious remarks
on habits, final causes, &c. &c., far more than do the regular
naturalists.
I am extremely glad to hear that you have begun your
travels ... I am very busy, but I shall be truly glad to
render any aid which I can by reading your first chapter or
two. I do not think I shall be able to correct style, for this
reason, that after repeated trials I find I cannot correct my
own style till I see the MS. in type. Some are born with a
power of good writing, like Wallace ; others like myself and
Lyell have to labour very hard and slowly at every sentence.
I find it a very good plan, when I cannot get a difficult
discussion to please me, to fancy that some one comes into
the room and asks me what I am doing ; and then try at
once and explain to the imaginary person what it is all
about. I have done this for one paragraph to myself several
times, and sometimes to Mrs. Danvin, till I see how the
subject ought to go. It is, I think, good to read ones MS.
aloud. But style to me is a great difficulty ; yet some good
Judges think I have succeeded, and I say this to encourage

trouble write better.
You shall have my candid opinion on your MS., but
remember it is hard to judge from MS., one reads slowly, and
heavy parts seem much heavier. A first-rate judge thought
my Journal very poor ; now that it is in print, I happen to
know, he likes it I am sure you will understand why I am

admirably good man in every sense.

same subject is interesting as giving an idea of the plan
followed by my father in writing his  Naturalists Voyage :
 As an old hackneyed author, let me give you a bit of
advice, viz. to strike out every word which is not quite

too much pains cannot be taken in making the style trans-

[Owing to the illness from scarlet fever of one of his boys,
he took a house at Bournemouth in the autumn. He wrote-
to Dr. Gray from Southampton (Aug. 21, 1862) :
We are a wretched family, and ought to be exterminated.
We slept here to rest our poor boy on his journey to Bourne-
mouth, and my poor dear wife sickened with scarlet fever,
and has had it pretty sharply, but is recovering well. There
is no end of trouble in this weary world. I shall not feel safe
till we are all at home together, and when that will be I know
not. But it is foolish complaining.
Dr. Gray used to send postage stamps to the scarlet fever
patient ; with regard to this good-natured deed my father
wrote
 I must just recur to stamps ; my little man has calculated
that he will now have 6 stamps which no other boy in the

The greater number of the letters of 1862 deal with the
Orchid work, but the wave of conversion to Evolution was
still spreading, and reviews and letters bearing on the subject
still came in numbers. As an example of the odd letters
he received may be mentioned one which arrived in January
of this year  from a German homoeopathic doctor, an ardent
admirer of the Origin. Had himself published nearly
the same sort of book, but goes much deeper. Explains

excellent evidence of varieties of Verbascum and Nicotiana
being partially sterile together. It is curious to me to read
(as I have to-day) the greatest crossing Gardener utterly
pooh-poohing the distinction which Botanists make on this
head, and insisting how frequently crossed varieties produce
sterile offspring. Do oblige me by reading the latter half of
my Primula paper in the  Linn. Journal, for it leads me to
suspect that sterility will hereafter have to be largely viewed
as an acquired or selected character  a view which I wish I

he will say Your notion of the Aristocrat being ken-
speckle, and the best men of a good lot being thus easily
selected is new to me, and striking. The  Origin  having made
you in fact a jolly old Tory, made us all laugh heartily. I
have sometimes speculated on this subject ; primogeniture* is
dreadfully opposed to selection ; suppo.se the first-born bull
was necessarily made by each farmer the begetter of his
stock ! On the other hand, as you say, ablest men arc con-

Lord-breeds, and the Lords continually select the most
beautiful and charming women out of the lower ranks ; so
that a good deal of indirect selection improves the Lords.

I believe that your pamphlet has done my book great good ;

magpies stole spoons, &c., from a remnant of some instinct
like that of the Bower-Bird, which ornaments its playing-

hinted plainly that all birds are descended from one ....
Your P.S. touches on, as it seems to me, very difficult
points. I am glad to see [that] in the  Origin, I only say
that the naturalists generally consider that low organisms
vary more than high ; and this I think certainly is the
general opinion. I put the statement this way to show that
I considered it only an opinion probably true. I must own
that I do not at all trust even Hookers contrary opinion, as
I feel pretty sure that he has not tabulated any result I
have some materials at home, I think I attempted to make
this point out, but cannot remember the result
Mere variability, though the necessary foundation of all
modifications, I believe to be almost always present, enough
to allow of any amount of selected change ; so that it docs
not seem to me at all incompatible that a group which at any
one period (or during all successive periods) varies less, should
in the long course of time have undergone more modification
than a group which is generally more variable.
Placental animals, c.g. might be at each period less variable
than Marsupials, and nevertheless have undergone more
differentiation and development than marsupials, owing to
some advantage, probably brain development.
I am surprised, but do not pretend to form an opinion at
Hookers statement that higher species, genera, &c., are best
limited. It seems to me a bold statement.
Looking to the  Origin, I see that I state that the pro-
ductions of the land seem to change quicker than those of
the sea (Chapter X., p. 339, 3rd edition), and 1 add there is
some reason to believe that organisms considered high in the
scale change quicker than those that are low. I remember
writing these sentences after much deliberation I

pointing out a loophole, and adds,f "with him I have no faith

to be that they are the modified descendants of earlier pro-

good palaeontologist who believes in immutability. Falconer
does not allow for the Proboscidean group being a failing one,
and therefore not likely to be giving off new races.
He adds that he does not think Natural Selection suffices.
I do not quite see the force of his argument, and he appa-

Selection can do nothing without variability, and that varia-
bility is subject to the most comple.x fixed laws

" I hardly know why I am a little sorry, but my present
work is leading me to believe rather more direct in the action

lessens the glory of Natural Selection, and is so confoundedly

will be.

admirable papers I ever read in my life. The mimetic cases
are truly marvellous, and you connect excellently a host of
analogous facts. The illustrations are beautiful, and seem
very well chosen ; but it would have saved the reader not a
little trouble, if the name of each had been engraved below
each separate figure. No doubt this would have put the
engraver into fits, as it would have destroyed the beauty of the
plate. I am not at all surprised at such a paper having con-
sumed much time. I am rejoiced that I passed over the
whole subject in the  Origin, for I should have made a pre-
cious mess of it. You have most clearly stated and solved
a wonderful problem. No doubt with most jjeople this will
be the cream of the paper ; but I am not sure that all your
facts and reasonings on variation, and on the segregation of
complete and semi-complete species, is not really more, or
at least as valuable, a part. I never conceived the process
nearly so clearly before ; one feels present at the creation of
new forms. I wish, however, you had enlarged a little more
on the pairing of similar varieties; a rather more numerous
body of facts seems here wanted. Then, again, what a host
of curious miscellaneous observations there arc  as on related
varieties of one species ; other mi-
mickers are undoubtedly distinct
species, or even distinct genera.
So again, some of the mimicked
forms can be shown to be merely
varieties ; but the greater number
must be ranked as distinct species.
Hence the creationist will have to
admit that some of these forms
have become imitators, by means
of the laws of variation, whilst
others he must look at as separately
created under their present guise ;
he will further have to admit that
some have been created in imita-
tion of forms not themselves created
as we now see them, but due to the
laws of variation! Prof. Agassiz,
indeed, would think nothing of this
difficulty ; for he believes that not
only each species and each variety,
but that groups of individuals,
though identically the same, when
inhabiting distinct countries, have
been all separately created in due
proportional numbers to the wants
of each land. Not many natur-

sexual and individual variability : these will some day, if I
live, be a treasure to me.
With respect to mimetic resemblance being so common
with insects, do you not think it may be connected with their
small size ; they cannot defend themselves ; they cannot
escape by flight, at least, from birds, therefore they escape
by trickery and deception ?
I have one serious criticism to make, and that is about the
title of the paper ; I cannot but think that you ought to have
called prominent attention in it to the mimetic resemblances.
Your paper is too good to be largely appreciated by the mob
of naturalists without souls ; but, rely on it, that it will have
lasting value, and I cordially congratulate you on your first
great work. You will find, I should think, that Wallace will
fully appreciate it How gets on your book ? Keep your
spirits up. A book is no light labour. I have been better

VARIATION OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS.
1863-1866.
His book on animals and plants under domestication was my
fathers chief employment in the year 1863. His diary
records the length of time spent over the composition of its
chapters, and shows the rate at which he arranged and wrote
out for printing the observations and deductions of several
years.
The three chapters in vol. ii. on inheritance, which occupy
84 pages of print, were begun in January and finished on
April 1st ; the five on crossing, making 106 pages, were written
in eight weeks, while the two chapters on selection, covering
57 pages, were begun on June 16th and finished on July 20th.
The work was more than once interrupted by ill-health,
and, in September, what proved to be tl>e beginning of a six
months illness forced him to leave home for the water-cure
at Malvern. He returned in October, and remained ill and
depressed, in spite of the hopeful opinion of one of the most
cheery and skilful physicians of the day. Thus he wrote to
Sir J. D. Hooker in November :
 Dr. Brinton has been here (recommended by Busk) ; he

does not believe my brain or heart are primarily affected, but I
have been so steadily going downhill, I cannot help doubting
whether I can ever crawl a little uphill again. Unless I can,
enough to work a little, I hope my life may be very short,
for to lie on a sofa all day and do nothing but give trouble to
the best and kindest of wives and good dear children is
dreadful.
The minor works in this year were a short paper in the
 Natural History Review  (N.S. vol. iii. p. 1 1 5), entitled  On
the so-called Auditory-Sac of Cirripedes, and one in the
 Geological Societys Journal  (vol. xix.), on the  Thickness of
the Pampjean Formation near Buenos Ayres. The paper
on Cirripedes was called forth by the criticisms of a German
naturalist Krohn,* and is of some interest in illustration of my
father's readiness to admit an error.
With regard to the spread of a belief in Evolution, it could
not yet be said that the battle was won, but the growth of
belief was undoubtedly rapid. So that, for instance, Charles
CTTXTHR Kingsley could write to F. D. Maurice :  f

Mr. Huxley was as usual active in guiding and stimulating
the growing tendency to tolerate or accept the views set forth
in the  Origin of Species. He gave a series of lectures to
working men at the School of Mines in November, 1862.
These were printed in 1863 from the shorthand notes of Mr.
May, as six little blue books, price 4 d. each, under the title,
 Our Knowledge of the Causes of Organic Nature. When
published they were read with interest by my father, who thus
refers to them in a letter to Sir J. D. Hooker :

MR. HUXLEYS LECTURES.
 I am very glad you like Huxleys lectures. I have been
very much struck with them, especially with the  Philosophy
of Induction. I have quarrelled with him for overdoing
sterility and ignoring cases from Gartner and Kolreuter about
sterile varieties. His geology is obscure ; and I rather doubt
about mans mind and language. But it seems to me ad-
mirably done, and, as you say,  Oh my !  about the praise of
the 1 Origin. I cant help liking it, which makes me rather
ashamed of myself.
My father admired the clearness of exposition shown in the
lectures, and in the following letter urges their author to
make use of his powers for the advantage of students :]

answered,  he has just written a great book on the skull.  I
dont call that a book, she replied, and added,  I want
something that people can read ; he does write so well.
Now, with your ease in writing, and with knowledge at your
fingers ends, do you not think you could write a popular
Treatise on Zoology ? Of course it would be some waste of
time, but I have been asked more than a dozen times to
recommend something for a beginner and could only think of
Carpenters Zoology. I am sure that a striking Treatise
would do real service to science by educating naturalists. If
you were to keep a portfolio open for a couple of years, and
throw in slips of paper as subjects crossed your mind, you
would soon have a skeleton (and that seems to me the diffi-
culty) on which to put the flesh and colours in your inimitable
manner. I believe such a book might have a brilliant success,
but I did not intend to scribble so much about it.

[In another letter (Jan. 1865) he returns to the above
suggestion, though he was in general strongly opposed to
men of science giving up to the writing of text-books, or to
teaching, the time that might otherwise have been given to
original research.
 I knew there was very little chance of your having time
to write a popular treatise on Zoology, but you are about the
one man who could do it At the time I felt it would be
almost a sin for you to do it, as it would of course destroy
some original work. On the other hand I sometimes think
that general and popular treatises are almost as important for
the progress of science as original work.

[CTTXTHR The following letter to Sir Julius von Haast,* is an
example of the sympathy which he felt with the spread and
growth of science in the colonies. It was a feeling not
expressed once only, but was frequently present in his
mind, and often found utterance. When we, at Cambridge,
had the satisfaction of receiving Sir J. von Haast into our
body as a Doctor of Science (July 1886), I had the oppor-

and other letters from my father, gave him. It was pleasant
to see how strong had been the impression made by my

Down, Jan. 22 [1863].
Dear Sir,  I thank you most sincerely for sending me
your Address and the Geological Report* I have seldom in
my life read anything more spirited and interesting than your
address. The progress of your colony makes one proud, and
it is really admirable to see a scientific institution founded in
so young a nation. I thank you for the very honourable
notice of my Origin of Species. You will easily believe
how much I have been interested by your striking facts on
the old glacial period, and I suppose the world might be
searched in vain for so grand a display of terraces. You
have, indeed, a noble field for scientific research and dis-
covery. I have been extremely much interested by what you
say about the tracks of supposed [living] mammalia. Might
I ask, if you succeed in discovering what the creatures are,
you would have the great kindness to inform me ? Perhaps
they may turn out something like the Solenhofen bird
creature, with its long tail and fingers, with claws to its
wings! I may mention that in South America, in com-
pletely uninhabited regions, I found spring rat-traps, baited
with cheese , were very successful in catching the smaller
mammals. I would venture to suggest to you to urge on
some of the capable members of your institution to observe
annually the rate and manner of spreading of European
weeds and insects, and especially to observe what native
plants most fail; this latter point has never been attended to.
Do the introduced hive-bees replace any other insect? &c.
All such points are, in my opinion, great desiderata in

anxious to read it, but did not know where to find it You

when I do if I wish to ask any questions I will venture to
trouble you. Your approbation of my book on Species has
gratified me extremely. Several naturalists in England,
North America, and Germany, have declared that their
opinions on the subject have in some degree been modified,
but as far as I know, my book has produced no effect what-

very kind expression of approbation. Pray believe me, dear

not seen the Athenaum* but I have sent for it, and may get
it to-morrow ; and will then say what I think.
I have read Lyells book. [ The Antiquity of Man.] The
whole certainly struck me as a compilation, but of the highest
class, for when possible the facts have been verified on the
spot, making it almost an original work. The Glacial chapters
seem to me best, and in parts magnificent. I could hardly
judge about Man, as all the gloss of novelty was completely
worn off. But certainly the aggregation of the evidence
produced a very striking effect on my mind. The chapter
comparing language and changes of species, seems most
ingenious and interesting. He has shown great skill in
picking out salient points in the argument for change of
species ; but I am deeply disappointed (I do not mean
personally) to find that his timidity prevents him giving
any judgment . . . From all my communications with him
I must ever think that he has really entirely lost faith in
the immutability of species ; and yet one of his strongest
sentences is nearly as follows :  If it should ever f be
rendered highly probable that species change by variation
and natural selection, &c. &c. I had hoped he would have
guided the public as far as his own belief went. . . . One
thing does please me on this subject, that he seems to
appreciate your work. No doubt the public or a part may be
induced to think that, as he gives to us a larger space than
to Lamarck, he must think there is something in our views.
When reading the brain chapter, it struck me forcibly that if
 In the Antiquity of Man,

somewhat severely Owens account
of the difference between the Hu-
man and Simian brains. The num-
ber of the Athenaum here referred
to (1863, p. 262) contains a reply
by Professor Owen to Lyells stric-
tures. The surprise expressed by
my father was at the revival of a
controversy which every one be-
lieved to be closed. Prof. Huxley
( Medical Times , Oct. 25, 1862,
quoted in * Mans Place in Nature,
p. 1 17) spoke of the two years
during which this preposterous con-
troversy has dragged its weary
length. And this no doubt ex-
pressed a very general feeling,

he had said openly that he believed in change of species, and
as a consequence that man was derived from some Quadru-
manous animal, it would have been very proper to have
discussed by compilation the differences in the most important
organ, viz. the brain. As it is, the chapter seems to me to
come in rather by the head and shoulders. I do not think
(but then I am as prejudiced as Falconer and Huxley, or more
so) that it is too severe ; it struck me as given with judicial
force. It might perhaps be said with truth that he had no
business to judge on a subject on which he knows nothing ;
but compilers must do this to a certain extent (You know I
value and rank high compilers, being one myself!) I have
taken you at your word, and scribbled at great length. If I
get the Atheneeum to-morrow, I will add my impression of
Owens letter.
. . . The Lyells are coming here on Sunday evening to
stay till Wednesday. I dread it, but I must say how much
disappointed I am that he has not spoken out on species, still
less on man. And the best of the joke is that he thinks he
has acted with the courage of a martyr of old. I hope I may
have taken an exaggerated view of his timidity, and shall
particularly be glad of your opinion on this head.* When
I got his book I turned over the pages, and saw he had dis-
cussed the subject of species, and said that I thought he would
do more to convert the public than all of us, and now (which
makes the case worse for me) I must, in common honesty,
retract. I wish to Heaven he had said not a word on the
subject
Wednesday morning: I have read the Atheneeum. I do
not think Lyell will be nearly so much annoyed as you
expect. The concluding sentence is no doubt very stinging.

No one but a good anatomist could unravel Owens letter ;
at least it is quite beyond me.

with approbation. I well remember Lyells admiration at this
new classification 1 (Do not repeat this.) I remember it,
because, though I knew nothing whatever about the brain, I
felt a conviction that a classification thus founded on a single
character would break down, and it seemed to me a great
error not to separate more completely the Marsupialia. . . .
What an accursed evil it is that there should be all this quar-
relling within, what ought to be, the peaceful realms of science.
I will go to my own present subject of inheritance and
forget it all for a time. Farewell, my dear old friend,

... If you have time to read you will be interested by
parts of Lyells book on man ; but I fear that the best part,
about the Glacial period, may be too geological for any one
except a regular geologist. He quotes you at the end with
gusto. By the way, he told me the other day how pleased
some had been by hearing that they could purchase your
pamphlet The Parthenon also speaks of it as the ablest
contribution to the literature of the subject It delights me
when I see your work appreciated.
The Lyells come here this day week, and I shall grumble
at his excessive caution. . . . The public may well say, if such
a man dare not or will not speak out his mind, how can we
who are ignorant form even a guess on the subject ? Lyell
was pleased when I told him lately that you thought that
language might be used as an excellent illustration of deriva-

on this. . . .
I read Cairnss excellent Lecture,* which shows so well
how your quarrel arose from Slavery. It made me for a time
wish honestly for the North ; but I could never help, though I
tried, all the time thinking how we should be bullied and
forced into a war by you, when you were triumphant But I
do most truly think it dreadful that the South, with its
accursed slavery, should triumph, and spread the evil. I think
if I had power, which, thank God, I have not, I would let you
conquer the border States, and all west of the Mississippi, and
then force you to acknowledge the cotton States. For do
you not now begin to doubt whether you can conquer and
hold them ? I have inflicted a long tirade on you.
The Times is getting more detestable (but that is too weak
a word) than ever. My good wife wishes to give it up, but I
tell her that is a pitch of heroism to which only a woman is
equal. To give up the Bloody Old Times," as Cobbett
used to call it, would be to give up meat, drink and air.

you like on how far variation and natural selection suffices.
I hope to Heaven I am wrong (and from what you say about
Whewell it seems so), but I cannot see how your chapters can
do more good than an extraordinary able review. I think
the Parthenon is right, that you will leave the public in a fog.
No doubt they may infer that as you give more space to

more of us. But I had always thought that your judgment
would have been an epoch in the subject All that is over

[Mr. Huxley has quoted (Vol. II. p. 193) some passages from
Lyells letters which show his state of mind at this time. The
following passage, from a letter of March nth to my father,
is also of much interest :
* After speculating on the sudden
appearance of individuals far above
the average of the human race,
Lyell asks if such leaps upwards in
the scale of intellect may not  have
cleared at one bound the space
which separated the highest stage
of the unprogressive intelligence of
the inferior animals from the first
and lowest form of improvable
reason manifested by man..

ANTIQUITY OF MAN.
My feelings, however, more than any thought about
policy or expediency, prevent me from dogmatising as to
the descent of man from the brutes, which, though I am
prepared to accept it, takes away much of the charm from
my speculations on the past relating to such matters. . . .
But you ought to be satisfied, as I shall bring hundreds
towards you who, if I treated the matter more dogmatically,
would have rebelled."]
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to C. Lyell.
Down, 12th [March, 1863].
My DEAR Lyell,  I thank you for your very interesting
and kind, I may say, charming letter. I feared you might be
huffed for a little time with me. I know some men would
have been so. I have hardly any more criticisms, anyhow,
worth writing. But I may mention that I felt a little surprise
that old B. de Perthes * was not rather more honourably men-
tioned. I would suggest whether you could not leave out
some references to the  Principles ;  one for the real student
is as good as a hundred, and it is rather irritating, and gives
a feeling of incompleteness to the general reader to be often
referred to other books. As you say that you have gone as far
as you believe on the species question, I have not a word to
say ; but I must feel convinced that at times, judging from
conversation, expressions, letters, &c., you have as completely
given up belief in immutability of specific forms as I have
done. I must still think a clear expression from you, if you
could have given it, would have been potent with the public,
and all the more so, as you formerly held opposite opinions.
The more I work, the more satisfied I become with variation
and natural selection, but that part of the case I look at as
less important, though more interesting to me personally. As
you ask for criticisms on this head (and believe me that
* Bom 1788, died 1868. Sec footnote, p. 16.
14 SPREAD OF EVOLUTION. [1863
I should not have made them unasked), I may specify
(pp. 412, 413) that such words as  Mr. D. labours to show,
is believed by the author to throw light, would lead a
common reader to think that you yourself do not at all agree,
but merely think it fair to give my opinion. Lastly, you
refer repeatedly to my view as a modification of Lamarcks
doctrine of development and progression. If this is your
deliberate opinion there is nothing to be said, but it does
not seem so to me. Plato, Buffon, my grandfather before
Lamarck, and others, propounded the obvious view that if
species were not created separately they must have descended
from other species, and I can see nothing else in common
between the  Origin  and Lamarck. I believe this way of
putting the case is very injurious to its acceptance, as it
implies necessary progression, and closely connects Wallaces
and my views with what I consider, after two deliberate
readings, as a wretched book, and one from which (I well
remember my surprise) I gained nothing. But I know you
rank it higher, which is curious, as it did not in the least
shake your belief. But enough, and more than enough.
Please remember you have brought it all down on yourself ! !
I am very sorry to hear about Falconers  reclamation. *
I hate the very word, and have a sincere affection for him.
Did you ever read anything so wretched as the Athenceum
reviews of you, and of Huxley t especially. Your object to
make man old, and Huxleys object to degrade him. The
wretched writer has not a glimpse what the discovery of
scientific truth means. How splendid some pages are in
Huxley, but I fear the book will not be popular. . . .

I should have thanked you sooner for the Athenaum and
very pleasant previous note, but I have been busy, and not a
little uncomfortable from frequent uneasy feeling of fullness,
slight pain and tickling about the heart But as I have no
other symptoms of heart complaint I do not suppose it is
affected. ... I have had a most kind and delightfully candid
letter from Lyell, who says he spoke out as far as he believes.
I have no doubt his belief failed him as he wrote, for I feel
sure that at times he no more believed in Creation than you
or I. I have grumbled a bit in my answer to him at his
always classing my work as a modification of Lamarcks,
which it is no more than any author who did not believe in
immutability of species, and did believe in descent. I am
very sorry to hear from Lyell that Falconer is going to
publish a formal reclamation of his own claims. . . .

letters and enclosure, and thank you sincerely for giving me
so much time when you must be so busy. What a curious

years ago, and am ashamed to think that I concluded the

whole was rubbish! Yet he has done for man something
like what Agassiz did for glaciers.*
I cannot say that I agree with Hooker about the public
not liking to be told what to conclude, if coming from one in
your position. But I am heartily sorry that I was led to make
complaints, or something very like complaints, on the manner
in which you have treated the subject, and still more so any-
thing about myself. I steadily endeavour never to forget my
firm belief that no one can at all judge about his own work.
As for Lamarck, as you have such a man as Grove with you,
you are triumphant ; not that I can alter my opinion that to
me it was an absolutely useless book. Perhaps this was
owing to my always searching books for facts, perhaps from
knowing my grandfathers earlier and identically the same
speculation. I will only further say that if I can analyse my
own feelings (a very doubtful process), it is nearly as much
for your sake as for my own, that I so much wish that your
state of belief could have permitted you to say boldly and
distinctly out that species were not separately created. I
have generally told you the progress of opinion, as I have
heard it, on the species question. A first-rate German natur-
alist t (I now forget the name 1), who has lately published a
grand folio, has spoken out to the utmost extent on the
 Origin. De Candolle, in a very good paper on  Oaks,
goes, in Asa Grays opinion, as far as he himself does ; but
De Candolle, in writing to me, says we,  we think this and

 Under the inAuence of his fore-
gone conclusion that I have ac-
cepted Mr. Darwin as my master,
and his hypothesis as my guide,
your reviewer represents me as
blind to the significance of the
general fact stated by me, that
 there has been no advance in the
foraminiferous type from the palae-
ozoic period to the present time.
But for such a foregone conclusion
he would have recognised in this
statement the expression of my
conviction that the present state of
scientific evidence, instead of sanc-
tioning the idea that the descend-
ants of the primitive type or types
of Foraminifera can ever rise to
any higher grade, justifies the anti-
Darwinian inference, that however
widely they diverge from each other
and from their originals, they still
remain Foraminifera .

that all the conditions for the first
production of a living organism are
now present, which could ever have
been present. But if (and oh !

sorts of ammonia and phosphoric
salts, light, heat, electricity, &c.,

attempt to explain specific transmutation are in fact related
to it in this wise, that they have prepared the minds of
naturalists for a better reception of such attempts to explain
the way of the origin of species from species.

Down, May 5 [1863].
I hope that you will grant me space to own that your
reviewer is quite correct when he states that any theory of
descent will connect,  by an intelligible thread of reasoning,
the several generalizations before specified. I ought to have
made this admission expressly; with the reservation, how-
ever, that, as far as I can judge, no theory so well explains or
connects these several generalizations (more especially the
formation of domestic races in comparison with natural
species, the principles of classification, embryonic resemblance,
&c.) as the theory, or hypothesis, or guess, if the reviewer so
likes to call it, of Natural Selection. Nor has any other
satisfactory explanation been ever offered of the almost
perfect adaptation of all organic beings to each other, and to
their physical conditions of life. Whether the naturalist
believes in the views given by Lamarck, by Geoffrey St.
Hilaire, by the author of the 1 Vestiges, by Mr. Wallace and
myself, or in any other such view, signifies extremely little in
comparison with the admission that species have descended
from other species, and have not been created immutable ;
for he who admits this as a great truth has a wide field
opened to him for further inquiry. I believe, however, from
what I see of the progress of opinion on the Continent, and in
this country, that the theory of Natural Selection will
ultimately be adopted, with, no doubt, many subordinate
modifications and improvements.

My dear Hooker,  You give good advice about not
writing in newspapers; I have been gnashing my teeth at
my own folly ; and this not caused by 's sneers, which
were so good that I almost enjoyed them. I have written
once again to own to a certain extent of truth in what he
says, and then if I am ever such a fool again, have no mercy
on me. I have read the squib in Public Opinion;* it is
capital ; if there is more, and you have a copy, do lend it. It
shows well that a scientific man had better be trampled in
dirt than squabble. I have been drawing diagrams, dissecting
shoots, and muddling my brains to a hopeless degree about
the divergence of leaves, and have of course utterly failed.

does not yield to the new theory of Evolution,  cannot
surrender at discretion so long as many important outworks
remain contestable. But he shows that the great body of
scientific opinion is flowing in the direction of belief.
The mention of Pasteur by Mr. Bentham is in reference
to the promulgation as it were ex cathedrA , of a theory
of spontaneous generation by the reviewer of Dr. Carpenter

out that in ignoring Pasteurs refutation of the supposed

that impartiality which every reviewer is supposed to
possess.]
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to G. Bentham.
Down, May 22 [1863].
My dear Bentham.  I am much obliged for your kind
and interesting letter. I have no fear of anything that a
man like you will say annoying me in the very least degree.
On the other hand, any approval from one whose judgment
and knowledge I have for many years so sincerely respected,
will gratify me much. The objection which you well put, of
certain forms remaining unaltered through long time and
space, is no doubt formidable in appearance, and to a certain
extent in reality according to my judgment. But does not
the difficulty rest much on our silently assuming that we know
more than we do ? I have literally found nothing so difficult
as to try and always remember our ignorance. I am never
weary, when walking in any new adjoining district or country,
of reflecting how absolutely ignorant we are why certain old
plants are not there present, and other new ones are, and
others in different proportions. If we once fully feel this, then
in judging the theory of Natural Selection, which implies that
a form will remain unaltered unless some alteration be to its

benefit, is it so very wonderful that some forms should change
much slower and much less, and some few should have
changed not at all under conditions which to us (who really
know nothing what are the important conditions) seem very
different. Certainly a priori we might have anticipated that
all the plants anciently introduced into Australia would have
undergone some modification ; but the fact that they have
not been modified does not seem to me a difficulty of weight
enough to shake a belief grounded on other arguments. I
have expressed myself miserably, but I am far from well
to-day.
I am very glad that you are going to allude to Pasteur ; I
was struck with infinite admiration at his work. With cordial
thanks, believe me, dear Bentham,
Yours very sincerely,
C. Darwin.
P.S.  In fact the belief in Natural Selection must at present
be grounded entirely on general considerations. (1) On its
being a vera causa, from the struggle for existence ; and the
certain geological fact that species do somehow change. (2)
From the analogy of change under domestication by mans
selection. (3) And chiefly from this view connecting under
an intelligible point of view a host of facts. When we descend
to details, we can prove that no one species has changed
[��>. we cannot prove that a single species has changed] ;
nor can we prove that the supposed changes are beneficial,
which is the groundwork of the theory. Nor can we
explain why some species have changed and others have
not. The latter case seems to me hardly more difficult to
understand precisely and in detail than the former case of
supposed change. Bronn may ask in vain, the old creationist
school and the new school, why one mouse has longer ears
than another mouse, and one plant more pointed leaves than
another plant.

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to G. Bentham.
Down, June 19 [1863].
My DEAR Bentham,  I have been extremely much pleased
and interested by your address, which you kindly sent me.
It seems to be excellently done, with as much judicial calm-
ness and impartiality as the Lord Chancellor could have
shown. But whether the immutable gentlemen would
agree with the impartiality may be doubted, there is too
much kindness shown towards me, Hooker, and others, they
might say. Moreover I verily believe that your address,
written as it is, will do more to shake the unshaken and bring
on those leaning to our side, than anything written directly in
favour of transmutation. I can hardly tell why it is, but your
address has pleased me as much as Lyells book disappointed
me, that is, the part on species, though so cleverly written. I
agree with all your remarks on the reviewers. By the way,
Lecoq* is a believer in the change of species. I, for one, can
conscientiously declare that I never feel surprised at any one
sticking to the belief of immutability ; though I am often not
a little surprised at the arguments advanced on this side. I
remember too well my endless oscillations of doubt and diffi-
culty. It is to me really laughable, when I think of the years
which elapsed before I saw what I believe to be the explana-
tion of some parts of the case ; I believe it was fifteen years
after I began before I saw the meaning and cause of the
divergence of the descendants of any one pair. You pay me
some most elegant and pleasing compliments. There is much
in your address which has pleased me much, especially your
remarks on various naturalists. I am so glad that you have
alluded so honourably to Pasteur. I have just read over this
note ; it does not express strongly enough the interest which
I have felt in reading your address. You have done, I

1864.
[In my fathers diary for 1864 is the entry,  111 all January,
February, March. About the middle of April (seven months
after the beginning of the illness in the previous autumn) his
health took a turn for the better. As soon as he was able
to do any work, he began to write his papers on Lythrum,
and on Climbing Plants, so that the work which now con-
cerns us did not begin until September, when he again set to
work on  CTTXTHR Animals and Plants. A letter to Sir J. D. Hooker
gives some account of the re-commencement of the work :
 I have begun looking over my old MS., and it is as fresh
as if I had never written it ; parts are astonishingly dull, but
yet worth printing, I think ; and other parts strike me as very
good. I am a complete millionaire in odd and curious little
facts, and I have been really astounded at my own industry
whilst reading my chapters on Inheritance and Selection.
God knows when the book will ever be completed, for I find
that I am very weak and on my best days cannot do more
than one or one and a half hours work. It is a good deal
harder than writing about my dear climbing plants.
In this year he received the greatest honour which a scientific
man can receive in this country  the Copley Medal of the
Royal Society. It is presented at the Anniversary Meeting
on St Andrews Day (Nov. 30), the medallist being usually
present to receive it, but this the state of my fathers health
prevented. CTTXTHR He wrote to Mr. Fox on this subject:
"I was glad to see your hand-writing. The Copley,
being open to all sciences and all the world, is reckoned a
great honour ; but excepting from several kind letters, such
things make little difference to me. It shows, however, that

Natural Selection is making some progress in this country, and
that pleases me. The subject, however, is safe in foreign lands.
To Sir J. D. Hooker, also, he wrote :
 How kind you have been about this medal ; indeed, I am
blessed with many good friends, and I have received four or
five notes which have warmed my heart I often wonder that
so old a worn-out dog as I am is not quite forgotten. Talking
of medals, has Falconer had the Royal ? he surely ought to
have it, as ought John Lubbock. By the way, the latter tells
me that some old members of the Royal are quite shocked at
my having the Copley. Do you know who ?
CTTXTHR He wrote to Mr. Huxley :
 I must and will answer you, for it is a real pleasure for me
to thank you cordially for your note. Such notes as this of
yours, and a few others, are the real medal to me, and not the
round bit of gold. These have given me a pleasure which
will long endure ; so believe in my cordial thanks for your note."
Sir Charles Lyell, writing to my father in November 1864
( Life, vol. ii. p. 384), speaks of the supposed malcontents as
being afraid to crown anything so unorthodox as the  Origin.
But he adds that if such were their feelings  they had the
good sense to draw in their horns. It appears, however, from
the same letter, that the proposal to give the Copley Medal
to my father in the previous year failed owing to a similar
want of courage to Lyells great indignation.
In the Reader , December 3, 1864, General Sabines presi-
dential address at the Anniversary Meeting is reported at
some length. Special weight was laid on my fathers work in
Geology, Zoology, and Botany, but the  Origin of Species  is
praised chiefly as containing  a mass of observations, &c.
It is curious that as in the case of his election to the French
Institute, so in this case, he was honoured not for the great
work of his life, but for his less important work in special
lines. The paragraph in General Sabines address which
refers to the ' Origin of Species, is as follows :
1 864-] COPLEY MEDAL  PROF. KOLLIKER. 29
 In his most recent work * On the Origin of Species, although
opinions may be divided or undecided with respect to its
merits in some respects, all will allow that it contains a mass
of observations bearing upon the habits, structure, affinities,
and distribution of animals, perhaps unrivalled for interest,
minuteness, and patience of observation. Some amongst us
may perhaps incline to accept the theory indicated by the
title of this work, while others may perhaps incline to refuse,
or at least to remit it to a future time, when increased know-
ledge shall afford stronger grounds for its ultimate acceptance
or rejection. Speaking generally and collectively, we have
expressly omitted it from the grounds of our award.
I believe I am right in saying that no little dissatisfaction
at the Presidents manner of allusion to the  Origin  was
felt by some Fellows of the Society.
The presentation of the Copley Medal is of interest in
another way, inasmuch as it led to Sir C. Lyell making, in
his after-dinner speech, a confession of faith as to the
 Origin.  He wrote to my father ( Life, vol ii. p. 384), " I
said I had been forced to give up my old faith without
thoroughly seeing my way to a new one. But I think you

and indeed thought of doing so myself, so that I considered
several points. You have hit on all, and on some in addition,
and oh ! by Jove, how well you have done it As I read on
and came to point after point on which I had thought, I could
not help jeering and scoffing at myself, to see how infinitely
better you had done it than I could have done. Well, if any

he will be a blockhead if it is not as clear as daylight Old

It is a marvel to me how you can resist becoming a regular
reviewer. Well, I have exploded now, and it has done me a
deal of good. . . .
[In the same article in the * Natural History Review, Mr.
Huxley speaks of the book above alluded to by Flourens, the
Secretaire Perpdtuel of the French Academy, as one of the
two  most elaborate criticisms  of the  Origin of Species
of the year. He quotes the following passage :
 M. Darwin continue : 1 Aucune distinction absolue na etc
et ne peut fitre 6tablie entre les espfeces et les varietes ! Je
vous ai deji dit que vous vous trompiez ; une distinction
absolue s��pare les vari��t��s davec les especes. Mr. Huxley
remarks on this,  Being devoid of the blessings of an Aca-
demy in England, we are unaccustomed to see our ablest men
treated in this way even by a Perpetual Secretary. After
demonstrating M. Flourens misapprehension of Natural
Selection, Mr. Huxley says,  How one knows it all by heart,
and with what relief one reads at p. 65, Je laisse M.
Darwin.
CTTXTHR On the same subject my father wrote to Mr. Wallace :

against me, which pleases me much, for it is plain that our
good work is spreading in France. He speaks of the
* engouement  about this book  so full of empty and
presumptuous thoughts. The passage here alluded to is
as follows :

[This was again a time of much ill-health, but towards the
close of the year he began to recover under the care of the
late Dr. Bence-Jones, who dieted him severely, and as he
expressed it, half-starved him to death. He was able to
work at  Animals and Plants  until nearly the end of April,
and from that time until December he did practically no work,
with the exception of looking over the  Origin of Species
for a second CTTXTHR French edition. He wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker :
  I am, as it were, reading the * Origin  for the first time,
for I am correcting for a second French edition : and upon
my life, my dear fellow, it is a very good book, but oh 1 my
gracious, it is tough reading, and I wish it were done. *
The following letter refers to the Duke of Argylls address
to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, December 5th, 1864, in
which he criticises the  Origin of Species. My father seems
to have read the Dukes address as reported in the Scotsman
of December 6th, 1865. In a letter to my father (Jan. 16,

My dear Lyell,  I thank you for your very interesting
letter. I have the true English instinctive reverence for rank,
and therefore liked to hear about the Princess Royal.* You
ask what I think of the Dukes address, and I shall be glad to
tell you. It seems to me extremely clever, like everything I
have read of his ; but I am not shaken  perhaps you will say
that neither gods nor men could shake me. I demur to the
Duke reiterating his objection that the brilliant plumage of
the male humming-bird could not have been acquired through
selection, at the same time entirely ignoring my discussion
(p. 93. 3 r d edition) on beautiful plumage being acquired
through sexual selection. The Duke may think this insuf-
ficient, but that is another question. All analogy makes me
quite disagree with the Duke that the difference in the beak,
wing, and tail, are not of importance to the several species.
In the only two species which I have watched, the difference
in flight and in the use of the tail was conspicuously great.

of differences for mere variety or beauty. It may be con-
fidently said that no tribe of plants presents such grotesque
and beautiful differences, which no one until lately, conjectured
were of any use ; but now in almost every case I have been
able to show their important service. It should be re-
membered that with humming-birds or orchids, a modification
in one part will cause correlated changes in other parts. I
agree with what you say about beauty. I formerly thought
a good deal on the subject, and was led quite to repudiate the
doctrine of beauty being created for beautys sake. I demur
also to the Dukes expression of  new births. That may be
a very good theory, but it is not mine, unless indeed he calls
a bird bom with a beak j^gth of an inch longer than usual
 a new birth ;  but this is not the sense in which the term
would usually be understood. The more I work, the more I
feel convinced that it is by the accumulation of such extremely
slight variations that new species arise. I do not plead guilty
to the Dukes charge, that I forget that natural selection means
only the preservation of variations which independently arise.*
I have expressed this in as strong language as I could use,
but it would have been infinitely tedious had I on every
occasion thus guarded myself. I will cry  peccavi  when I
hear of the Duke or you attacking breeders for saying that
man has made his improved shorthorns, or pouter pigeons, or
bantams. And I could quote still stronger expressions used
by agriculturists. Man does make his artificial breeds, for his
selective power is of such importance relatively to that of the
slight spontaneous variations. But no one will attack breeders
for using such expressions, and the rising generation will not
blame me.
Many thanks for your offer of sending me the  Elements. t

not, for I think it would have made some impression on me ;

Down, Feb. 21 [1865].
My dear Lyell,  I have taken a long time to thank you
very much for your present of the  Elements.
I am going through it all, reading what is new, and what I
have forgotten, and this is a good deal.
I am simply astonished at the amount of labour, knowledge,
and clear thought condensed in this work. The whole strikes
me as something quite grand. I have been particularly
interested by your account of Heers work and your discussion
on the Atlantic Continent. I am particularly delighted at
the view which you take on this subject; for I have long
thought Forbes did an ill service in so freely making
continents.
I have also been very glad to read your argument on the
denudation of the Weald, and your excellent rtsumi on the
Purbeck Beds ; and this is the point at which I have at present
arrived in your book. I cannot say that I am quite convinced
that there is no connection beyond that pointed out by you,
between glacial action and the formation of lake basins ; but
you will not much value my opinion on this head, as I have
already changed my mind some half-dozen times.
I want to make a suggestion to you. I found the weight
of your volume intolerable, especially when lying down, so
with great boldness cut it into two pieces, and took it out of
its cover ; now could not Murray without any other change
add to his advertisement a line saying,  if bound in two
volumes, one shilling or one shilling and sixpence extra. You
thus might originate a change which would be a blessing to
all weak-handed readers.
Believe me, my dear Lyell,
Yours most sincerely,
Charles Darwin.

(we both think it perfection) that I am now beginning at the
beginning. I cannot resist telling you how excellently well,
in my opinion, you have done the very interesting chapter on
savage life. Though you have necessarily only compiled the
materials the general result is most original. But I ought to
keep the term original for your last chapter, which has struck
me as an admirable and profound discussion. It has quite
delighted me, for now the public will see what kind of man
you are, which I am proud to think I discovered a dozen
years ago.
I do sincerely wish you all success in your election and in

My dear Sir, I have been for a long time so ill that I
have only just finished hearing read aloud your work on
species. And now you must permit me to thank you
cordially for the great interest with which I have read it
You have done admirable service in the cause in which we
both believe. Many of your arguments seem to me excellent,
and many of your facts wonderful. Of the latter, nothing has
surprised me so much as the two forms of males. I have
lately investigated the cases of dimorphic plants, and I should
much like to send you one or two of my papers if I knew
how. I did send lately by post a paper on climbing plants,
as an experiment to see whether it would reach you. One of
the points which has struck me most in your paper is that on
the differences in the air-breathing apparatus of the several
forms. This subject appeared to me very important when I
formerly considered the electric apparatus of fishes. Your

observations on Classification and Embryology seem to me
very good and original. They show what a wonderful field
there is for enquiry on the development of Crustacea, and
nothing has convinced me so plainly what admirable results
we shall arrive at in Natural History in the course of a few
years. What a marvellous range of structure the Crustacea
present, and how well adapted they are for your enquiry !
Until reading your book I knew nothing of the Rhizocephala ;
pray look at my account and figures of Anelasma, for it seems
to me that this latter cirripede is a beautiful connecting link
with the Rhizocephala.
If ever you have any opportunity, as you are so skilful a
dissector, I much wish that you would look to the orifice at
the base of the first pair of cirrhi in cirripedes, and at the
curious organ in it, and discover what its nature is ; I sup-
pose I was quite in error, yet I cannot feel fully satisfied at
Krohns * observations. Also if you ever find any species of
Scalpellum, pray look for complemental males ; a German
author has recently doubted my observations, for no reason
except that the facts appeared to him so strange.
Permit me again to thank you cordially for the pleasure
which I have derived from your work, and to express my
sincere admiration for your valuable researches.
Believe me, dear Sir, with sincere respect,
Yours very faithfully,
C. Darwin.
P.S.  I do not know whether you care at all about plants,
but if so, I should much like to send you my little work on
the  Fertilization of Orchids, and I think I have a German
copy.
Could you spare me a photograph of yourself? I should
much like to possess one.

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to J. D. Hooker.
Down, Thursday, 27th [Sept. 186;].
My DEAR HOOKER,  I had intended writing this morning
to thank Mrs. Hooker most sincerely for her last and several
notes about you, and now your own note in your hand has
rejoiced me. To walk between five and six miles is splendid,
with a little patience you must soon be well. I knew you had
been very ill, but I hardly knew how ill, until yesterday, when
Bentham (from the Cranworths *) called here, and I was able
to see him for ten minutes. He told me also a little about
the last days of your father ; t I wish I had known your father
better, my impression is confined to his remarkably cordial,
courteous and frank bearing. I fully concur and understand
what you say about the difference of feeling in the loss of a
father and child. I do not think any one could love a father
much more than I did mine, and I do not believe three or four
days ever pass without my still thinking of him, but his death
at eighty-four caused me nothing of that insufferable grief {
which the loss of poor dear Annie caused. And this seems to
me perfectly natural, for one knows that for years previously
* Robert Rolfc, Lord Cranworth,
and Lord Chancellor of England,
lived at Holwood, near Down.
t Sir Wm. Hooker; b. 1785,
d. 1865. He took charge of the
Royal Gardens at Kew, in 1840,
when they ceased to be the private
gardens of the Royal Family. In
doing so, he gave up his professor-
ship at Glasgow  and with it half
of his income. He founded the
herbarium and library, and within
ten years he succeeded in making
the gardens the first in the world.
It is, thus, not too much to say that
the creation of the establishment
at Kew is due to the abilities and
self-devotion of Sir William Hooker.
While, for the subsequent develop-
ment of the gardens up to their
present magnificent condition, the
nation must thank Sir Joseph
Hooker, in whom the same qualities
are so conspicuous.
t I may quote here a passage
from a letter of November 1863.
It was written to a friend who had
lost his child :  How well I re-
member your feeling, when we lost
Annie. It was my greatest comfort
that I had never spoken a harsh
word to her. Your grief has made
me shed a few tears over our poor
darling ; but believe me that these
tears have lost that unutterable
bitterness of former days.

that ones fathers death is drawing slowly nearer and nearer,
while the death of ones child is a sudden and dreadful
wrench. What a wonderful deal you read ; it is a horrid evil
for me that I can read hardly anything, for it makes my head
almost immediately begin to sing violently. My good
womenkind read to me a great deal, but I dare not ask for
much science, and am not sure that I could stand it I
enjoyed Tylor * extremely , and the first part of Lecky ; t but
I think the latter is often vague, and gives a false appearance
of throwing light on his subject by such phrases as  spirit of

to a quarter or half hour per day in skimming through the
back volumes of the Annals and Magazines of Natural Hist-
ory, and find much that interests me. I miss my climbing
plants very much, as I could observe them when very
poorly.

Remember what Trollope says, in Can you Forgive her?
about getting into Parliament, as the highest earthly ambition.
Jeffrey, in one of his letters, I remember, says that making an
effective speech in Parliament is a far grander thing than

short-sighted view. I cannot tell you how it has rejoiced
me once again seeing your handwriting  my best of old
friends.

Dear Sir,  As I have never studied the science of lan-

resist the pleasure of telling you what interest and pleasure I
have derived from hearing read aloud your volume.f
I formerly read Max Muller, and thought his theory (if it
deserves to be called so) both obscure and weak ; and now,
after hearing what you say, I feel sure that this is the case,
and that your cause will ultimately triumph. My indirect
interest in your book has been increased from Mr. Hensleigh

No one could dissent from my views on the modification of
species with more courtesy than you da But from the tenor
of your mind I feel an entire and comfortable conviction
(and which cannot possibly be disturbed) that if your studies
led you to attend much to general questions in natural
history you would come to the same conclusion that I have
done.

There seems to have been a gradual amendment in his
health ; thus he wrote to Mr. Wallace (January 1866) :   My
health is so far improved that I am able to work one or two
hours a day.
With respect to the 4th edition he wrote to Sir J. D.
Hooker :
The new edition of the Origin has caused me two
great vexations. I forgot Batess paper on variation* but I
remembered in time his mimetic work, and now, strange to
say, I find I have forgotten your Arctic paper 1 I know how
it arose ; I indexed for my bigger work, and never expected
that a new edition of the  Origin  would be wanted.
I cannot say how all this has vexed me. Everything
which I have read during the last four years I find is quite
washy in my mind. As far as I know, Mr. Batess paper
was not mentioned in the later editions of the Origin,
for what reason I cannot say.
In connection with his work on The Variation of
Animals and Plants, I give here extracts from three letters
addressed to Mr. Huxley, which are of interest as giving
some idea of the development of the theory of  Pangenesis,
ultimately published in 1868 in the book in question :]
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to T. H. Huxley.
Down, May 27, [1865 ?]
... I write now to ask a favour of you, a veiy great favour
from one so hard worked as you are. It is to read thirty
pages of MS., excellently copied out, and give me, not length-
ened criticism, but your opinion whether I may venture to
publish it You may keep the MS. for a month or two.
I would not ask this favour, but I really know no one else
whose judgment on the subject would be final with me.
44
SPREAD OF EVOLUTION.
[1866.
The case stands thus : in my next book I shall publish
long chapters on bud- and seminal-variation, on inheritance,
reversion, effects of use and disuse, &c. I have also for many
years speculated on the different forms of reproduction.
Hence it has come to be a passion with me to try to connect
all such facts by some sort of hypothesis. The MS. which I
wish to send you gives such a hypothesis ; it is a very rash
and crude hypothesis, yet it has been a considerable relief to
my mind, and I can hang on it a good many groups of facts.
I well know that a mere hypothesis, and this is nothing more,
is of little value ; but it is very useful to me as serving as a
kind of summary for certain chapters. Now I earnestly wish
for your verdict given briefly as,  Bum it   or, which is the
most favourable verdict I can hope for, It does rudely
connect together certain facts, and I do not think it will
immediately pass out of my mind. If you can say this
much, and you do not think it absolutely ridiculous, I shall
publish it in my concluding chapter. Now will you grant
me this favour? You must refuse if you are too much over-
worked.
I must say for myself that I am a hero to expose my
hypothesis to the fiery ordeal of your criticism.
July ii, [1865?]
My DEAR Huxley,  I thank you most sincerely for having
so carefully considered my MS. It has been a real act of
kindness. It would have annoyed me extremely to have
re-published Buffons views, which I did not know of, but I
will get the book; and if I have strength I will also read
Bonnet. I do not doubt your judgment is perfectly just,
and I will try to persuade myself not to publish. The whole
affair is much too speculative ; yet I think some such view
will have to be adopted, when I call to mind such facts as
the inherited effects of use and disuse, &c. But I will try to
be cautious. ...
PANGENESIS.
45
1866.]
[1865?]
My DEAR HUXLEY,  Forgive my writing in pencil, as I
can do so lying down. I have read Buffon : whole pages
are laughably like mine. It is surprising how candid it
makes one to see ones views in another man's words. I
am rather ashamed of the whole affair, but not converted
to a no-belief. What a kindness you have done me with
your vulpine sharpness." Nevertheless, there is a funda-
mental distinction between Buffons views and mine. He
does not suppose that each cell or atom of tissue throws
off a little bud ; but he supposes that the sap or blood
includes his  organic molecules, which are ready formed, fit
to nourish each organ, and when this is fully formed, they
collect to form buds and the sexual elements. It is all
rubbish to speculate as I have done; yet, if I ever have
strength to publish my next book, I fear I shall not resist
 Pangenesis, but I assure you I will put it humbly enough.
The ordinary course of development of beings, such as the
Echinodermata, in which new organs are formed at quite
remote spots from the analogous previous parts, seems to me
extremely difficult to reconcile on any view except the free
diffusion in the parent of the germs or gemmules of each
separate new organ : and so in cases of alternate generation.
But I will not scribble any more. Hearty thanks to you, you

all that you say on the advantages of H. Spencers excellent

expression of the survival of the fittest.* This, however,
had not occurred to me till reading your letter. It is, however,
a great objection to this term that it cannot be used as a
substantive governing a verb ; and that this is a real objection
I infer from H. Spencer continually using the words, natural
selection. I formerly thought, probably in an exaggerated
degree, that it was a great advantage to bring into connection
natural and artificial selection ; this indeed led me to use a
term in common, and I still think it some advantage. I wish
I had received your letter two months ago, for I would have
worked in  the survival, &c., often in the new edition of the
 Origin, which is now almost printed off, and of which I will
of course send you a copy. I will use the term in my next
book on Domestic Animals, &c., from which, by the way, I
plainly see that you expect much too much. The term
Natural Selection has now been so largely used abroad and
at home, that I doubt whether it could be given up, and with
all its faults I should be sorry to see the attempt made.
Whether it will be rejected must now depend  on the survival
of the fittest. As in time the term must grow intelligible
the objections to its use will grow weaker and weaker. I
doubt whether the use of any term would have made the
subject intelligible to some minds, clear as it is to others;
for do we not see even to the present day Malthus on Popu-
lation absurdly misunderstood ? This reflection about Malthus
has often comforted me when I have been vexed at the mis-
statement of my views. As for M. Janet, t he is a meta-
physician, and such gentlemen are so acute that I think they
often misunderstand common folk. Your criticism on the

to me and unanswerable ; but my blunder has done no harm,
for I do not believe that any one, excepting you, has ever
observed it. Again, I agree that I have said too much about
 favourable variations but I am inclined to think that you
put the opposite side too strongly; if every part of every
being varied, I do not think we should see the same end, or
object, gained by such wonderfully diversified means.
I hope you are enjoying the country, and are in good
health, and are working hard at your Malay Archipelago book,

work some hours daily. With many thanks for your

I am rejoiced that you will publish your lecture, and felt sure
that sooner or later it would come to this, indeed it would
have been a sin if you had not done so. I am especially
rejoiced as you give the arguments for occasional transport
with such perfect fairness ; these will now receive a fair share
of attention, as coming from you, a professed botanist. Thanks
also for Groves address ; as a whole it strikes me as very
good and original, but I was disappointed in the part about

MY DEAR SIR,  I thank you for your extremely kind
letter. I cannot express too strongly my satisfaction that you
have undertaken the revision of the new edition, and I feel the
honour which you have conferred on me. I fear that you will
find the labour considerable, not only on account of the
additions, but I suspect that Bronns translation is very
defective, at least I have heard complaints on this head from
quite a large number of persons. It would be a great gratifi-
cation to me to know that the translation was a really good
one, such as I have no doubt you will produce. According
to our English practice* you will be fully justified in entirely
omitting Bronns Appendix, and I shall be very glad of its
omission. A new edition may be looked at as a new work.
.... You could add anything of your own that you liked,
and I should be much pleased. Should you make any
additions or append notes, it appears to me that Nageli,

one of the most able pamphlets on the subject. I am, how-
ever, far from agreeing with him that the acquisition of certain
characters which appear to be of no service to plants, offers
any great difficulty, or affords a proof of some innate tendency
in plants towards perfection. If you intend to notice this
pamphlet, I should like to write hereafter a little more in
detail on the subject.

Dear Sir,  I hope you will excuse the liberty which I
take in writing to you. I have just read, though imperfectly,
your * Entstehung und Begriff, and .have been so greatly
interested by it, that I have sent it to be translated, as I am
a poor German scholar. I have just finished a new [4th]
edition of my  Origin, which will be translated into German,
and my object in writing to you is to say that if you should
see this edition you would think that I had borrowed from
you, without acknowledgment, two discussions on the beauty
of flowers and fruit ; but I assure you every word was printed
off" before I had opened your pamphlet. Should you like to
possess a copy of either the German or English new edition, I
should be proud to send one. I may add, with respect to the
beauty of flowers, that I have already hinted the same views
as you hold in my paper on Lythrum.
Many of your criticisms on my views are the best which I
have met with, but I could answer some, at least to my own
satisfaction ; and I regret extremely that I had not read your

pamphlet before printing my new edition.* On one or two
points, I think, you have a little misunderstood me, though I
dare say I have not been cautious in expressing myself. The
remark which has struck me most, is that on the position of
the leaves not having been acquired through natural selection,
from not being of any special importance to the plant. I
well remember being formerly troubled by an analogous
difficulty, namely, the position of the ovules, their anatropous
condition, &c. It was owing to forgetfulness that I did not
notice this difficulty in the Origin. Although I can offer
no explanation of such facts, and only hope to see that they
may be explained, yet I hardly see how they support the
doctrine of some law of necessary development, for it is not
clear to me that a plant, with its leaves placed at some
particular angle, or with its ovules in some particular position,
thus stands higher than another plant. But I must apologise
for troubling you with these remarks.
As I much wish to possess your photograph, I take the
liberty of enclosing my own, and with sincere respect I remain,
Yours faithfully,
C. Darwin.

subject ? Hooker says you did ; where is it ?
To Dr. Asa Gray.
[May 31, 1863?]
 I have been looking at Nagelis work on this subject, and
am astonished to see that the angle is not always the same in
young shoots when the leaf-buds are first distinguishable, as
in full-grown branches. This shows, I think, that there must be
some potent cause for those angles which do occur : I dare
say there is some explanation as simple as that for the
angles of the Bees-cells."
My father also corresponded with Dr. Hubert Airy and
was interested in his views on the subject, published in the
Royal Soc. Proceedings, 1873, p. 176.
We now return to the year 1866. In November, when the

"You will shriek at me when you hear that I have just
subscribed to the Jamaica Committee. *
On this subject I quote from a letter of my brothers :
CTTXTHR With respect to Governor Eyres conduct in Jamaica, he
felt strongly that J. S. Mill was right in prosecuting him. I
remember one evening, at my Uncles, we were talking on the
subject, and as I happened to think it was too strong a
measure to prosecute Governor Eyre for murder, I made
some foolish remark about the prosecutors spending the
surplus of the fund in a dinner. My father turned on me
almost with fury, and told me, if those were my feelings, I
had better go back to Southampton ; the inhabitants having
given a dinner to Governor Eyre on his landing, but with
which I had had nothing to do." The end of the incident,
as told by my brother, is so characteristic of my father that I
cannot resist giving it, though it has no bearing on the point
at issue.  Next morning at 7 oclock, or so, he came into
my bedroom and sat on my bed, and said that he had not
been able to sleep, from the thought that he had been so
angry with me, and after a few more kind words he left me.
The same restless desire to correct a disagreeable or in-
correct impression is well illustrated in a passage which I
quote from some notes by Rev. J. Brodie Innes :
 Allied to the extreme carefulness of observation was his
most remarkable truthfulness in all matters. On one occa-
sion, when a parish meeting had been held on some disputed
point of no great importance, I was surprised by a visit from
Mr. Darwin at night. He came to say that, thinking over
the debate, though what he had said was quite accurate, he
thought I might have drawn an erroneous conclusion, and he
would not sleep till he had explained it I believe that if on
any day some certain fact had come to his knowle dge wh ich
contradicted his most cherished theories, he

This tallies with my fathers habits, as described by him-
self. When a difficulty or an objection occurred to him,
he thought it of paramount importance to make a note of
it instantly, because he found hostile facts to be especially
evanescent.
The same point is illustrated by the following incident, for
which I am indebted to Mr. Romanes :
 I have always remembered the following little incident as
a good example of Mr. Darwins extreme solicitude on the
score of accuracy. One evening at Down there was a
general conversation upon the difficulty of explaining the
evolution of some of the distinctively human emotions, espe-
cially those appertaining to the recognition of beauty in
natural scenery. I suggested a view of my own upon the
subject, which, depending upon the principle of association,
required the supposition that a long line of ancestors should
have inhabited regions, the scenery of which is now re-
garded as beautiful. Just as I was about to observe that the
chief difficulty attaching to my hypothesis arose from
feelings of the sublime (seeing that these are associated with
awe, and might therefore be expected not to be agreeable),
Mr. Darwin anticipated the remark, by asking how the
hypothesis was to meet the case of these feelings. In the
conversation which followed, he said the occasion in his own
life, when he was most affected by the emotions of the sublime
was when he stood upon one of the summits of the Cordillera,
and surveyed the magnificent prospect all around. It seemed,
as he quaintly observed, as if his nerves had become fiddle-
strings, and had all taken to rapidly vibrating. This remark
was only made incidentally, and the conversation passed into
some other branch. About an hour afterwards Mr. Darwin
retired to rest, while I sat up in the smoking-room with one
of his sons. We continued smoking and talking for several
hours, when at about one oclock in the morning the door
gently opened and Mr. Darwin appeared, in his slippers and

dressing-gown. As nearly as I can remember, the following
are the words he used :
 ' Since I went to bed I have been thinking over our con-
versation in the drawing-room, and it has just occurred to me
that I was wrong in telling you I felt most of the sublime
when on the top of the Cordillera ; I am quite sure that I
felt it even more when in the forests of Brazil. I thought it
best to come and tell you this at once in case I should be
putting you wrong. I am sure now that I felt most sublime
in the forests.
 This was all he had come' to say, and it was evident
that he had come to do so, because he thought that the fact
of his feeling  most sublime in forests  was more in accord-
ance with the hypothesis which we had been discussing, than
the fact which he had previously stated. Now, as no one knew
better than Mr. Darwin the difference between a speculation
and a fact, I thought this little exhibition of scientific con-
scientiousness very noteworthy, where the only question
concerned was of so highly speculative a character. I should
not have been so much impressed if he had thought that by
his temporary failure of memory he had put me on a wrong
scent in any matter of fact, although even in such a case he
is the only man I ever knew who would care to get out of
bed at such a time of night in order to make the correction
immediately, instead of waiting till next morning. But as
the correction only had reference to a flimsy hypothesis,
I certainly was very much impressed by this display of
character.]

feeling that he was twice as ingenious and clever as myself,
but when I feel that he is about a dozen times my superior,
even in the master art of wriggling, I feel aggrieved. If he
had trained himself to observe more, even if at the expense,
by the law of balancement, of some loss of thinking power, he
would have been a wonderful man.
.... I am heartily glad you are taking up the Distribution
of Plants in New Zealand, and suppose it will make part of
your new book. Your view, as I understand it, that New
Zealand subsided and formed two or more small islands, and
then rose again, seems to me extremely probable
When I puzzled my brains about New Zealand, I remember
I came to the conclusion, as indeed I state in the  Origin,
that its flora, as well as that of other southern lands, had
been tinctured by an Antarctic flora, which must have existed
before the Glacial period. I concluded that New Zealand
never could have been closely connected with Australia,
though I supposed it had received some few Australian
forms by occasional means of transport Is there any
reason to suppose that New Zealand could have been more
closely connected with South Australia during the Glacial
period, when the Eucalypti, &c., might have been driven further
North? Apparently there remains only the line, which I
think you suggested, of sunken islands from New Caledonia.
Please remember that the Edwardsia was certainly drifted
there by the sea.
I remember in old days speculating on the amount of life,
*>. of organic chemical change, at different periods. There
seems to me one very difficult element in the problem,
namely, the state of development of the organic beings at
each period, for I presume that a Flora and Fauna of cellular
cryptogamic plants, of Protozoa and Radiata would lead to
much less chemical change than is now going on. But I have
scribbled enough.

C. Darwin.

fruit in the  Variation of Animals and Plants. Mr. Dyer has
some excellent remarks on the unexpected value thus placed
on the apparently trivial facts disinterred from weekly journals,

scrap which you have written in periodicals, and abstracted in
MS. your book on Roses, and several times I thought I would
write to you, but did not know whether you would think me too
intrusive. I shall, indeed, be truly obliged for any informa-
tion you can supply me on bud-variation or sports. When
any extra difficult points occur to me in my present subject
(which is a mass of difficulties), I will apply to you, but I will
not be unreasonable. It is most true what you say that any
one to study well the physiology of the life of plants, ought to
have under his eye a multitude of plants. I have endeavoured
to do what I can by comparing statements by many writers
and observing what I could myself. Unfortunately few have

observed like you have done. As you are so kind, I will
mention one other point on which I am collecting facts;
namely, the effect produced on the stock by the graft ; thus,
it is said, that the purple-leaved filbert affects the leaves of
the common hazel on which it is grafted (I have just procured
a plant to try), so variegated jessamine is said to affect
its stock. I want these facts partly to throw light on the
marvellous laburnums, Adami-trifacial oranges, &c. That
laburnum case seems one of the strangest in physiology.
I have now growing splendid, fertile, yellow laburnums (with
a long raceme like the so-called Waterers laburnum) from
seed of yellow flowers on the C. Adarni. To a man like
myself, who is compelled to live a solitary life, and sees
few persons, it is no slight satisfaction to hear that I have
been able at all [to] interest by my books observers like
yourself.
As I shall publish on my present subject, I presume,
within a year, it will be of no use your sending me the shoots
of peaches and nectarines which you so kindly offer ; I have
recorded your facts.
Permit me again to thank you cordially ; I have not often
in my life received a kinder letter.
My dear Sir, yours sincerely,
C. Darwin.
CHAPTER II.
THE PUBLICATION OF THE VARIATION OF ANIMALS
AND PLANTS UNDER DOMESTICATION.
JANUARY 1867, TO JUNE 1868.
At the beginning of the year 1867 he was at work on the
final chapter  Concluding Remarks of the Variation of
Animals and Plants under Domestication, which was begun
after the rest of the MS. had been sent to the printers in the
preceding December. With regard to the publication of the
book he wrote to Mr. Murray, on January 3 :
 I cannot tell you how sorry I am to hear of the enormous
size of my book.* I fear it can never pay. But I cannot
shorten it now ; nor, indeed, if I had foreseen its length, do
I see which parts ought to have been omitted.
 If you are afraid to publish it, say so at once, I beg you,
and I will consider your note as cancelled. If you think fit,
get any one whose judgment you rely on, to look over some
of the more legible chapters, namely, the Introduction, and
on dogs and plants, the latter chapters being, in my opinion,
the dullest in the book. . . . The list of chapters, and the
inspection of a few here and there, would give a good judge
 On January 9 he wrote to Sir
J. D. Hooker :  I have been these
last few days vexed and annoyed
to a foolish degree by hearing that
my MS. on Dorn. An. and Cult.
Plants will make 2 vols., both
bigger than the Origin. The
volumes will have to be full-sized

to suggest details to be printed in
small type. But I feel that the
size is quite ludicrous in relation to
the subject. I am ready to swear

writes a book.

a fair idea of the whole book. Pray do not publish blindly,
as it would vex me all my life if I led you to heavy loss."
Mr. Murray referred the MS. to a literary friend, and, in
spite of a somewhat adverse opinion, willingly agreed to
publish the book. My father wrote :
Your note has been a great relief to me. I am rather
alarmed about the verdict of your friend, as he is not a man
of science. I think if you had sent the  Origin  to an un-
scientific man, he would have utterly condemned it. I am,
however, very glad that you have consulted any one on whom
you can rely.
I must add, that my Journal of Researches  was seen in
MS. by an eminent semi-scientific man, and was pronounced
unfit for publication.
The proofs were begun in March, and the last revise was
finished on November 15th, and during this period the only
intervals of rest were two visits of a week each at his brother
Erasmuss house in Queen Anne Street. He notes in his
Diary :
I began this book [in the] beginning of i860 (and then
had some MS.), but owing to interruptions from my illness,
and illness of children ; from various editions of the  Origin,
and Papers, especially Orchis book and Tendrils, I have
spent four years and two months over it
The edition of Animals and Plants was of 1500 copies,
and of these 1260 were sold at Mr. Murrays autumnal sale,
but it was not published until January 30, 1868. A new
edition of 1250 copies was printed in February of the same year.
In 1867 he received the distinction of being made a
knight of the Prussian Order  Pour le Mdrite. * He seems

not to have known how great the distinction was, for in June
1868 he wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker :

Down, February 8 [1867].
My dear Hooker,  I am heartily glad that you have
been offered the Presidentship of the British Association, for
it is a great honour, and as you have so much work to do,
I am equally glad that you have declined it I feel, however,
convinced that you would have succeeded very well ; but if
I fancy myself in such a position, it actually makes my blood
run cold. I look back with amazement at the skill and taste
with which the Duke of Argyll made a multitude of little
speeches at Glasgow. By the way, I have not seen the
Dukes book,* but I formerly thought that some of the
articles which appeared in periodicals were very clever, but
not very profound. One of these was reviewed in the Satur-
day Review t some years ago, and the fallacy of some main
argument was admirably exposed, and I sent the article to
you, and you agreed strongly with it. . , . There was the
other day a rather good review of the Dukes book in the
ship. Faraday, Herschel, and
Thomas Moore have belonged to
it in this way. From the thirty
members a chancellor is elected by
the king (the first officer of this
kind was Alexander v. Humboldt) ;
and it is the duty of the chancellor
to notify a vacancy in the Order to
the remainder of the thirty, who
then elect by vote the new member
 but the king has technically the
appointment in his own hands.

Spectator, and with a new explanation, either by the Duke or
the reviewer (I could not make out which), of rudimentary
organs, namely, that economy of labour and material was
a great guiding principle with God (ignoring waste of seed
and of young monsters, &c.), and that making a new plan for
the structure of animals was thought, and thought was labour,
and therefore God kept to a uniform plan, and left rudiments.
This is no exaggeration. In short, God is a man, rather
cleverer than us. . . . Iam very much obliged for the Nation
(returned by this post) ; it is admirably good. You say I
always guess wrong, but I do not believe any one, except Asa
Gray, could have done the thing so well. I would bet even,
or three to two, that it is Asa Gray, though one or two
passages staggered me.
I finish my book on  Domestic Animals, &c., by a single
paragraph, answering, or rather throwing doubt, in so far as
so little space permits, on Asa Grays doctrine that each
variation has been specially ordered or led along a beneficial
line. It is foolish to touch such subjects, but there have been
so many allusions to what I think about the part which God
has played in the formation of organic beings,* that I thought
it shabby to evade the question. ... I have even received
several letters on the subject. ... I overlooked your sen-
tence about Providence, and suppose I treated it as Buckland
did his own theology, when his Bridgewater Treatise was
read aloud to him for correction. . . ,
* Prof. Judd allows me to quote
from some notes which he has
kindly given me :   Lyell once
told me that he had frequently been
asked if Darwin was not one of the
most unhappy of men, it being
suggested that his outrage upon
public opinion should have filled
him with remorse. Sir Charles
must have been able, I think, to
give a conclusive answer on this
point. Professor J udd continues
 I made a note of this and other
conversations of Lyells at the time.
At the present time such statements
must appear strange to any one who
does not recollect the revolution in
opinion which has taken place
during the last 23 years [1882].
1867.] EVOLUTION AND RELIGION. 63
[The following letter, from Mrs. Boole, is one of those
referred to in the last letter to Sir J. D. Hooker :]
Dear Sir,  Will you excuse my venturing to ask you a
question, to which no ones answer but your own would be
quite satisfactory ?
Do you consider the holding of your theory of Natural
Selection, in its fullest and most unreserved sense, to be
inconsistent  I do not say with any particular scheme of
theological doctrine  but with the following belief, namely :
That knowledge is given to man by the direct inspiration
of the Spirit of God.
That God is a personal and Infinitely good Being.
That the effect of the action of the Spirit of God on the
brain of man is especially a moral effect.
And that each individual man has within certain limits
a power of choice as to how far he will yield to his hereditary
animal impulses, and how far he will rather follow the
guidance of the Spirit, who is educating him into a power of
resisting those impulses in obedience to moral motives ?
The reason why I ask you is this : my own impression has
always been, not only that your theory was perfectly com-
patible with the faith to which I have just tried to give
expression, but that your books afforded me a clue which
would guide me in applying that faith to the solution of
certain complicated psychological problems which it was
of practical importance to me as a mother to solve. I felt
that you had supplied one of the missing links  not to say
the missing link  between the facts of science and the pro-
mises of religion. Every year's experience tends to deepen
in me that impression.
But I have lately read remarks on the probable bearing of
your theory on religious and moral questions which have
perplexed and pained me sorely. I know that the persons
who make such remarks must be cleverer and wiser than
64  VARIATION UNDER DOMESTICATION. [1867.
myself. I cannot feel sure that they are mistaken, unless
you will tell me so. And I think  T cannot know for certain
 but I think  that if I were an author, I would rather that
the humblest student of my works should apply to me
directly in a difficulty, than that she should puzzle too long
over adverse and probably mistaken or thoughtless criticisms.
At the same time I feel that you have a perfect right to
refuse to answer such questions as I have asked you. Science
must take her path, and Theology hers, and they will meet
when and where and how God pleases, and you are in no
sense responsible for it if the meeting-point should still be
very far off. If I receive no answer to this letter I shall infer
nothing from your silence, except that you felt I had no right
to make such inquiries of a stranger.
[My father replied as follows :]
Down, December 14, 1866.
Dear Madam,  It Would have gratified me much if I
could have sent satisfactory answers to your questions, or,
indeed, answers of any kind. But I cannot see how the
belief that all organic beings, including man, have been genet-
ically derived from some simple being, instead of having been
separately created, bears on your difficulties. These, as it
seems to me, can be answered only by widely different evi-
dence from science, or by the so-called  inner consciousness.
My opinion is not worth more than that of any other man
who has thought on such subjects, and it would be folly in
me to give it. I may, however, remark that it has always ap-
peared to me more satisfactory to look at the immense amount
of pain and suffering in this world as the inevitable result of the
natural sequence of events, i.e. general laws, rather than from
the direct intervention of God, though I am aware this is not
logical with reference to an omniscient Deity. Your last
question seems to resolve itself into the problem of free will
and necessity, which has been found by most persons insoluble

I sincerely wish that this note had not been as utterly
valueless as it is. I would have sent full answers, though
I have little time or strength to spare, had it been in my
power.
I have the honour to remain, dear Madam,
Yours very faithfully,
Charles Darwin.
P.S.  I am grieved that my views should incidentally have
caused trouble to your mind, but I thank you for your judg-
ment, and honour you for it, that theology and science
should each run its own course, and that in the present case
I am not responsible if their meeting-point should still be
far off.

... I am at present reading the Duke, and am very much
interested by him ; yet I cannot but think, clever as the whole
is, that parts arc weak, as when he doubts whether each curva-
ture of the beak of humming-birds is of service to each species.
He admits, perhaps too fully, that I have shown the use of
each little ridge and shape of each petal in orchids, and
how strange he does not extend the view to humming-birds.
Still odder, it seems to me, all that he says on beauty, which
I should have thought a nonentity, except in the mind of
some sentient being. He might have as well said that love
existed during the secondary or Palaeozoic periods. I hope
you are getting on with your book better than I am with
mine, which kills me with the labour of correcting, and is
intolerably dull, though I did not think so when I was writing

Down, February 17 [1867].
My DEAR Sir,  I have read your preface with care. It
seems to me that you have treated Bronn with complete
respect and great delicacy, and that you have alluded to your
own labour with much modesty. I do not think that any of
Bronns friends can complain of what you say and what you
have done. For my own sake, I grieve that you have not
added notes, as I am sure that I should have profited much
by them ; but as you have omitted Bronns objections, I
believe that you have acted with excellent judgment and
fairness in leaving the text without comment to the inde-
pendent verdict of the reader. I heartily congratulate you
that the main part of your labour is over ; it would have been
to most men a very troublesome task, but you seem to have
indomitable powers of work, judging from those two wonder-
ful and most useful volumes on zoological literature* edited
by you, and which I never open without surprise at their ac-
curacy, and gratitude for their usefulness. I cannot sufficiently
tell you how much I rejoice that you were persuaded to super-
intend the translation of the present edition of my book, for I
have now the great satisfaction of knowing that the German
public can judge fairly of its merits and demerits. ....
With my cordial and sincere thanks, believe me,

PROFESSOR HAECKEL.
6 7
[The earliest letter which I have seen from my father to
Professor Haeckel, was written in 1865, and from that time
forward they corresponded (though not, I think, with any
regularity) up to the end of my father's life. His friendship
with Haeckel was not merely growth of correspondence, as
was the case with some others, for instance, Fritz Muller.
Haeckel paid more than one visit to Down, and these were
thoroughly enjoyed by my father. The following letter will
serve to show the strong feeling of regard which he enter-
tained for his correspondent  a feeling which I have often
heard him emphatically express, and which was warmly
returned. The book referred to is Haeckels Generelle
Morphologie, published in 1866, a copy of which my father
received from the author in January 1867.
Dr. E. Krause * has given a good account of Professor
Haeckels services to the cause of Evolution. After speak-
ing of the lukewarm reception which the  Origin  met with in
Germany on its first publication, he goes on to describe the
first adherents of the new faith as more or less popular
writers, not especially likely to advance its acceptance with
the professorial or purely scientific world. And he claims for
Haeckel that it was his advocacy of Evolution in his * Radio-
laria (1862), and at the  Versammlung of Naturalists at
Stettin in 1863, that placed the Darwinian question for the
first time publicly before the forum of German science, and
his enthusiastic propagandism that chiefly contributed to its
success.
Mr. Huxley, writing in 1869, paid a high tribute to
Professor Haeckel as the Coryphaeus of the Darwinian move-
ment in Germany. Of his * Generelle Morphologie,  an
attempt to work out the practical applications  of the doctrine
of Evolution to their final results, he says that it has the
force and suggestiveness, and . . . systematising power
of Oken without his extravagance." Professor Huxley also
  Charles Darwin und sein Verhaltniss zu Deutschland, 1885.
VARIATION UNDER DOMESTICATION. [1867.
testifies to the value of Haeckels  Schopfungs-Geschichte  as
an exposition of the  Generelle Morphologie   for an educated
public.
Again, in his  Evolution in Biology,  Mr. Huxley wrote :
 Whatever hesitation may, not unfrequently, be felt by less
daring minds, in following Haeckel in many of his specula-
tions, his attempt to systematise the doctrine of Evolution,
and to exhibit its influence as the central thought of modem
biology, cannot fail to have a far-reaching influence on the
progress of science.
In the following letter my father alludes to the somewhat
fierce manner in which Professor Haeckel fought the battle of
 Darwinismus, and on this subject Dr. Krause has some good
remarks (p. 162). He asks whether much that happened in
the heat of the conflict might not well have been otherwise,
and adds that Haeckel himself is the last man to deny this.
Nevertheless he thinks that even these things may have worked
well for the cause of Evolution, inasmuch as Haeckel con-
centrated on himself by his  Ursprung des Menschen-
Geschlechts, his  Generelle Morphologie, and * Schopfungs-
Geschichte, all the hatred and bitterness which Evolution
excited in certain quarters, so that,  in a surprisingly short
time it became the fashion in Germany that Haeckel alone
should be abused, while Darwin was held up as the ideal of
forethought and moderation."]

Down, May 21, 1867.
Dear Haeckel.  -Your letter of the 18th has given me
great pleasure, for you have received what I said in the most
kind and cordial manner. You have in part taken what I
said much stronger than I had intended. It never occurred

subject so admirably and clearly arranged, as well as fortified
by so many new facts and arguments, would not advance our
common object in the highest degree. All that I think is
that you will excite anger, and that anger so completely
blinds every one, that your arguments would have no chance
of influencing those who are already opposed to our views.
Moreover, I do not at all like that you, towards whom I feel
so much friendship, should unnecessarily make enemies, and
there is pain and vexation enough in the world without more
being caused. But I repeat that I can feel no doubt that
your work will greatly advance our subject, and I heartily
wish it could be translated into English, for my own sake and
that of others. With respect to what you say about my
advancing too strongly objections against my own views, some
of my English friends think that I have erred on this side ;
but truth compelled me to write what I did, and I am inclined
to think it was good policy. The belief in the descent theory
is slowly spreading in England,* even amongst those who can
give no reason for their belief. No body of men were at first
so much opposed to my views as the members of the London
Entomological Society, but now I am assured that, with the
exception of two or three old men, all the members concur
with me to a certain extent. It has been a great disappoint-
ment to me that I have never received your long letter written
to me from the Canary Islands. I am rejoiced to hear that
your tour, which seems to have been a most interesting one,
has done your health much good. I am working away at my
new book, but make very slow progress, and the work tries my
health, which is much the same as when you were here.

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to F. Muller.
Down, July 31 [1867].
My DEAR Sir,  I received a week ago your letter of
June 2, full as usual of valuable matter and specimens. It
arrived at exactly the right time, for I was enabled to give
a pretty full abstract of your observations on the plants
own pollen being poisonous. I have inserted this abstract
in the proof-sheets in my chapter on sterility, and it forms
the most striking part of my whole chapter* I thank
you very sincerely for the most interesting observations,
which, however, I regret that you did not publish inde-
pendently. I have been forced to abbreviate one or two
parts more than I wished . . . Your letters always surprise
me, from the number of points to which you attend. I wish
I could make my letters of any interest to you, for I hardly
ever see a naturalist, and live as retired a life as you in
Brazil. With respect to mimetic plants, I remember Hooker
many years ago saying he believed that there were many, but I
agree with you that it would be most difficult to distinguish
between mimetic resemblance and the effects of peculiar con-
ditions. Who can say to which of these causes to attribute
the several plants with heath-like foliage at the Cape of Good
Hope? Is it not also a difficulty that quadrupeds appear to
recognise plants more by their [scent] than their appearance?

MIMICRY.
What I have just said reminds me to ask you a question.
Sir J. Lubbock brought me the other day what appears to be
a terrestrial Planaria (the first ever found in the northern
hemisphere) and which was coloured exactly like our dark-
coloured slugs. Now slugs are not devoured by birds, like
the shell-bearing species, and this made me remember that I
found the Brazilian Planariae actually together with striped
Vaginuli which I believe were similarly coloured. Can you
throw any light on this? I wish to know, because I was
puzzled some months ago how it would be possible to account
for the bright colours of the Planariae in reference to sexual
selection. By the way, I suppose they are hermaphrodites.
Do not forget to aid me, if in your power, with answers to
any of my questions on expression, for the subject interests
me greatly. With cordial thanks for your never-failing kind-
ness, believe me,
Yours very sincerely,
Charles Darwin.

Down, July x8 [1867].
My DEAR Lyell,  Many thanks for your long letter. I
am sorry to hear that you are in despair about your book ; *
I well know that feeling, but am now getting out of the lower
depths. I shall be very much pleased, if you can make the
least use of my present book, and do not care at all whether
it is published before yours. Mine will appear towards the
end of November of this year ; you speak of yours as not
coming out till November, 1868, which I hope may bean error.
There is nothing about Man in my book which can interfere
with you, so I will order all the completed clean sheets to be
sent (and others as soon as ready) to you, but please observe
you will not care for the first volume, which is a mere record

of the amount of variation ; but I hope the second will be
somewhat more interesting. Though I fear the whole must
be dull.
I rejoice from my heart that you are going to speak out
plainly about species. My book about Man, if published, will
be short, and a large portion will be devoted to sexual selec-
tion, to which subject I alluded in the  Origin  as bearing on
Man. . . .
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to C. Lyell.
Down, August 22 [1867].
My DEAR Lyell,  I thank you cordially for your last two
letters. The former one did me real good, for I had got so
wearied with the subject that I could hardly bear to correct
the proofs,* and you gave me fresh heart. I remember
thinking that when you came to the Pigeon chapter you
would pass it over as quite unreadable. Your last letter has
interested me in very many ways, and I have been glad to
hear about those horrid unbelieving Frenchmen. I have been
particularly pleased that you have noticed Pangenesis. I do
not know whether you ever had the feeling of having thought
so much over a subject that you had lost all power of judging
it This is my case with Pangenesis (which is 26 or 27 years
old), but I am inclined to think that if it be admitted as a
probable hypothesis it will be a somewhat important step in
Biology.
I cannot help still regretting that you have ever looked at
the slips, for I hope to improve the whole a good deal. It is
surprising to me, and delightful, that you should care in the
least about the plants. Altogether you have given me one of
the best cordials I ever had in my life, and I heartily thank
you. I despatched this morning the French edition.f The

Down, October 16 [1867].
My dear Gray,  I send by this post clean sheets of
Vol. I. up to p. 336, and there are only 41 1 pages in this vol.
I am very glad to hear that you are going to review my book ;
but if the Nation * is a newspaper I wish it were at the
bottom of the sea, for I fear that you will thus be stopped
reviewing me in a scientific journal. The first volume is all
details, and you will not be able to read it ; and you must
remember that the chapters on plants are written for natural-
ists who are not botanists. The last chapter in Vol. I. is,
however, I think, a curious compilation of facts ; it is on bud-
variation. In Vol. II. some of the chapters are more interest-
ing ; and I shall be very curious to hear your verdict on the
chapter on close inter-breeding. The chapter on what I call
Pangenesis will be called a mad dream, and I shall be pretty
well satisfied if you think it a dream worth publishing ; but
at the bottom of my own mind I think it contains a great
truth. I finish my book with a semi-theological paragraph,
in which I quote and differ from you ; what you will think of
it, I know not. . . .
 The book was reviewed by Dr. Gray in the Notion, Mar. 19, 1868.

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to J. D. Hooker.
Down, November 17 [1867].
My DEAR Hooker, Congratulate me, for I have finished
the last revise of the last sheet of my book. It has been an
awful job : seven and a half months correcting the press : the
book, from much small type, does not look big, but is really
very big. I have had hard work to keep up to the mark, but
during the last week only few revises came, so that I have
rested and feel more myself. Hence, after our long mutual
silence, I enjoy myself by writing a note to you, for the sake
of exhaling, and hearing from you. On account of the
index,* I do not suppose that you will receive your copy till
the middle of next month. I shall be intensely anxious to
hear what you think about Pangenesis ; though I can see how
fearfully imperfect, even in mere conjectural conclusions, it is ;
yet it has been an infinite satisfaction to me somehow to
connect the various large groups of facts, which I have long
considered, by an intelligible thread. I shall not be at all
surprised if you attack it and me with unparalleled ferocity.
It will be my endeavour to do as little as possible for some time,
but [I] shall soon prepare a paper or two for the Linnean
Society. In a short time we shall go to London for ten
days, but the time is not yet fixed. Now I have told you a
deal about myself, and do let me hear a good deal about your
own past and future doings. Can you pay us a visit, early in
December ? .... I have seen no one for an age, and heard
no news.
. . . About my book I will give you a bit of advice. Skip
the whole of Vol. I., except the last chapter (and that need
only be skimmed) and skip largely in the 2nd volume ; and
then you will say it is a very good book.

[The Variation of Animals and Plants was, as already
mentioned, published on January 30, 1868, and on that day
he sent a copy to Fritz Muller, and wrote to him :
 I send by this post, by French packet, my new book, the
publication of which has been much delayed. The greater
part, as you will see, is not meant to be read ; but I should
very much like to hear what you think of Pangenesis,
though I fear it will appear to every one far too speculative.]
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to J. D. Hooker.
February 3 [1868].
... I am very much pleased at what you say about my
Introduction ; after it was in type I was as near as possible
cancelling the whole. I have been for some time in despair
about my book, and if I try to read a few pages I feel fairly
nauseated, but do not let this make you praise it ; for I have
made up my mind that it is not worth a fifth part of the
enormous labour it has cost me. I assure you that all that is
worth your doing (if you have time for so much) is glancing
at Chapter VI, and reading parts of the later chapters.
The facts on self-impotent plants seem to me curious, and I
have worked out to my own satisfaction the good from cross-
ing and evil from interbreeding. I did read Pangenesis the
other evening, but even this, my beloved child, as I had
fancied, quite disgusted me. The devil take the whole book ;
and yet now I am at work again as hard as I am able. It is
really a great evil that from habit I have pleasure in hardly
anything except Natural History, for nothing else makes me
forget my ever-recurrent uncomfortable sensations. But I
must not howl any more, and the critics may say what they
like ; I did my best, and man can do no more. What a
splendid pursuit Natural History would be if it was all
observing and no writing ! . . . .

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to J. D. Hooker.
Down, February 10 [1868].
My DEAR Hooker,  What is the good of having a friend,
if one may not boast to him ? I heard yesterday that Murray
has sold in a week the whole edition of 1500 copies of my
book, and the sale so pressing that he has agreed with Clowes
to get another edition in fourteen days ! This has done me a
world of good, for I had got into a sort of dogged hatred of
my book. And now there has appeared a review in the Pall
Mall which has pleased me excessively, more perhaps than is
reasonable. I am quite content, and do not care how much I
may be pitched into. If by any chance you should hear who
wrote the article in the Pall Mall, do please tell me ; it is
some one who writes capitally, and who knows the subject
I went to luncheon on Sunday, to Lubbocks, partly in hopes
of seeing you, and, be hanged to you, you were not there.
Your cock-a-hoop friend,
C. Darwin.
[Independently of the favourable tone of the able series of
notices in the Pall Mall Gazette (Feb. 10, 15, 17, 1868), my
father may well have been gratified by the following passages:
 We must call attention to the rare and noble calmness with
which he expounds his own views, undisturbed by the heats
of polemical agitation which those views have excited, and
persistently refusing to retort on his antagonists by ridicule,
by indignation, or by contempt. Considering the amount of
vituperation and insinuation which has come from the other
side, this forbearance is supremely dignified.
And again in the third notice, Feb. 17 :

sensitive self-love of an antagonist ; nowhere does he, in text
or note, expose the fallacies and mistakes of brother investi-
gators . . . but while abstaining from impertinent censure,

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to J. D. Hooker.
Down, February 23 [1868].
My DEAR HOOKER,  I have had almost as many letters
to write of late as you can have, viz. from 8 to 10 per diem,
chiefly getting up facts on sexual selection, therefore I have
felt no inclination to write to you, and now I mean to write
solely about my book for my own satisfaction, and not at all for
yours. The first edition was 1 500 copies, and now the second
is printed off ; sharp work. Did you look at the review in the
Athenanm* showing profound contempt of me ? ... It is a
shame that he should have said that I have taken much from
Pouchet, without acknowledgment ; for I took literally nothing,
there being nothing to take. There is a capital review in the
Gardeners' Chronicle, which will sell the book if anything will.
 Athenrum, February 15, 1868.
My father quoted Pouchets asser-
tion that variation under domes-
tication throws no light on the
natural modification of species.
The reviewer quotes the end of
a passage in which my father de-
clares that he can see no force
in Pouchets arguments, or rather
assertions, and then goes on : We
are sadly mistaken if there are not
clear proofs in the pages of the
book before us that, on the contrary,
Mr. Darwin has perceived, felt, and
yielded to the force of the argu-
antagonist. The following may
serve as samples of the rest of the

I dont quite see whether I or the writer is in a muddle about
man causing variability. If a man drops a bit of iron into
sulphuric acid he does not cause the affinities to come into
play, yet he may be said to make sulphate of iron. I do not
know how to avoid ambiguity.
After what the Pall Mall Gazette and the Chronicle have
said, I do not care a d  .
I fear Pangenesis is stillborn ; Bates says he has read it
twice, and is not sure that he understands it. H. Spencer
says the view is quite different from his (and this is a great
relief to me, as I feared to be accused of plagiarism, but
utterly failed to be sure what he meant, so thought it safest
to give my view as almost the same as his), and he says he is
not sure he understands it . . . Am I not a poor devil ? yet I
took such pains, I must think that I expressed myself clearly.
Old Sir H. Holland says he has read it twice, and thinks it
very tough ; but believes that sooner or later  some view
akin to it  will be accepted.
You will think me very self-sufficient, when I declare that I
feel sure if Pangenesis is now stillborn it will, thank God,
at some future time reappear, begotten by some other father,
and christened by some other name.
Have you ever met with any tangible and clear view of
what takes place in generation, whether by seeds or buds, or
how a long-lost character can possibly reappear ; or how the
male element can possibly affect the mother plant, or the
mother animal, so that her future progeny are affected ? Now
all these points and many others are connected together,
whether truly or falsely is another question, by Pangenesis.
You see I die hard, and stick up for my poor child.
This letter is written for my own satisfaction, and not for
yours. So bear it.
Yours affectionately,
C. Darwin.

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to A. Newton *
Down, February 9 [1870].
Dear Newton,  I suppose it would be universally held
extremely wrong for a defendant to write to a Judge to
express his satisfaction at a judgment in his favour ; and yet
I am going thus to act. I have just read what you have said
in the  Record  f about my pigeon chapters, and it has gratified
me beyond measure. I have sometimes felt a little dis-
appointed that the labour of so many years seemed to be
almost thrown away, for you are the first man capable of
forming a judgment (excepting partly Quatrefages), who
seems to have thought anything of this part of my work.
The amount of labour, correspondence, and care, which the
subject cost me, is more than you could well suppose. I
thought the article in the Atheticemn was very unjust; but
now I feel amply repaid, and I cordially thank you for your
sympathy and too warm praise. What labour you have
bestowed on your part of the ' Record  ! I ought to be ashamed
to speak of my amount of work. I thoroughly enjoyed the
Sunday which you and the others spent here, and
I remain, dear Newton, yours very sincerely,

None of my friends will speak out . . . Hooker, as far as I
understand him, which I hardly do at present, seems to
think that the hypothesis is little more than saying that
organisms have such and such potentialities. What you

say exactly and fully expresses my feeling, viz. that it
is a relief to have some feasible explanation of the various
facts, which can be given up as soon as any better hypo-
thesis is found. It has certainly been an immense relief
to my mind ; for I have been stumbling over the subject for
years, dimly seeing that some relation existed between the
various classes of facts. I now hear from H. Spencer that his
views quoted in my foot-note refer to something quite distinct,
as you seem to have perceived.
I shall be very glad to hear at some future day your criti-
cisms on the "causes of variability. Indeed I feel sure that
I am right about sterility and natural selection. . . . I do not
quite understand your case, and we think that a word or two
is misplaced. I wish some time you would consider the case
under the following point of view :  If sterility is caused or
accumulated through natural selection, then as every degree
exists up to absolute barrenness, natural selection must have
the power of increasing it. Now take two species, A and B,
and assume that they are (by any means) half-sterile, i.e.
produce half the full number of offspring. Now try and make
(by natural selection) A and B absolutely sterile when
crossed, and you will find how difficult it is. I grant, indeed
it is certain, that the degree of sterility of the individuals A
and B will vary, but any such extra-sterile individuals of, we
will say A, if they should hereafter breed with other indi-
viduals of A, will bequeath no advantage to their progeny, by
which these families will tend to increase in number over
other families of A, which are not more sterile when crossed
with B. But I do not know that I have made this any
clearer than in the chapter in my book. It is a most difficult
bit of reasoning, which I have gone over and over again on
paper with diagrams.
. . . Hearty thanks for your letter. You have indeed
pleased me, for I had given up the great god Pan as a still-
born deity. I wish you could be induced to make it clear,
with your admirable powers of elucidation, in one of the
scientific journals. . . .
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to J. D. Hooker.
Down, February 28 [1868].
My dear Hooker, I have been deeply interested by
your letter, and we had a good laugh over Huxleys remark,
which was so deuced clever that you could not recollect it. I
cannot quite follow your train of thought, for in the last page
you admit all that I wish, having apparently denied all, or
thought all mere words in the previous pages of your note ;
but it may be my muddle. I see clearly that any satisfaction
which Pan may give will depend on the constitution of each
mans mind. If you have arrived already at any similar
conclusion, the whole will of course appear stale to you. I
heard yesterday from Wallace, who says (excuse horrid
vanity), "I can hardly tell you how much I admire the
chapter on  Pangenesis. It is a positive comfort to me to
have any feasible explanation of a difficulty that has always
been haunting me, and I shall never be able to give it up till
a better one supplies its place, and that I think hardly
possible, 8cc. Now his foregoing [italicised] words express
my sentiments exactly and fully: though perhaps I feel
the relief extra strongly from having during many years
vainly attempted to form some hypothesis. When you or
Huxley say that a single cell of a plant, or the stump of an
amputated limb, has the potentiality of reproducing the
whole  or diffuses an influence, these words give me no
positive idea ;  but, when it is said that the cells of a plant,
or stump, include atoms derived from every other cell of the
whole organism and capable of development, I gain a distinct
idea. But this idea would not be worth a rush, if it applied
to one case alone ; but it seems to me to apply to all the
forms of reproduction  inheritance  metamorphosis  to the

abnormal transposition of organs  to the direct action of the
male element on the mother plant, &c. Therefore I fully
believe that each cell does actually throw off an atom or
gemmule of its contents ;  but whether or not, this hypothesis
serves as a useful connecting link for various grand classes
of physiological facts, which at present stand absolutely
isolated.
I have touched on the doubtful point (alluded to by
Huxley) how far atoms derived from the same cell may
become developed into different structure accordingly as they
are differently nourished ; I advanced as illustrations galls
and polypoid excrescences. . . .
It is a real pleasure to me to write to you on this subject,
and I should be delighted if we can understand each other:
but you must not let your good nature lead you on. Remem-
ber we always fight tooth and nail. We go to London on

... I am very much obliged to you for sending me so
frankly your opinion on Pangenesis, and I am sorry it is

pangenesis, selection, and the struggle for life not being more
methodical. I am not at all surprised at your unfavourable
verdict ; I know many, probably most, will come to the same
conclusion. One English Review says it is much too com-
plicated. . .. . Some of my friends are enthusiastic on the
hypothesis. ... Sir C. Lyell says to every one, You may
not believe in ' Pangenesis, but if you once understand it, you
will never get it out of your mind. And with this criticism
I am perfectly content. All cases of inheritance and reversion

My dear Gray,  I have been a most ungrateful and
ungracious man not to have written to you an immense time
ago to thank you heartily for the Nation, and for all your
most kind aid in regard to the American edition [of  Animals
and Plants J. But I have been of late ovenvhelmed with
letters, which I was forced to answer, and so put off writing
to you. This morning I received the American edition
(which looks capital), with your nice preface, for which hearty
thanks. I hope to heaven that the book will succeed well
enough to prevent you repenting of your aid. This arrival
has put the finishing stroke to my conscience, which will
endure its wrongs no longer.
. . . Your article in the Nation [Mar. 19] seems to me very
good, and you give an excellent idea of Pangenesis  an infant
cherished by few as yet, except his tender parent, but which
will live a long life. There is parental presumption for you!
You give a good slap at my concluding metaphor : * undoubt-
edly I ought to have brought in and contrasted natural and
artificial selection ; but it seemed so obvious to me that
natural selection depended on contingencies even more
* A short abstract of the precipice
metaphor is given at p. 307, vol. i.
Dr. Grays criticism on this point
is as follows :  But in Mr. Dar-

nature according to his own view
of it, not only the fragments of rock
(answering to variation) should fall,
but the edifice (answering to natural
selection) should rise, irrespective
of will or choice !  But my father!

complex than those which must have determined the shape of
each fragment at the base of my precipice. What I wanted
to show was that, in reference to pre-ordainment, whatever
holds good in the formation of a pouter pigeon holds good in
the formation of a natural species of pigeon. I cannot see
that this is false. If the right variations occurred, and no
others, natural selection would be superfluous. A reviewer in
an Edinburgh paper, who treats me with profound contempt,
says on this subject that Professor Asa Gray could with the
greatest ease smash me into little pieces.*

for the pleasure which you have given me. I am delighted at
what you say about my book. I got so tired of it, that for
months together I thought myself a perfect fool for having
given up so much time in collecting and observing little facts,
but now I do not care if a score of common critics speak as
contemptuously of the book as did the Athenaum. I feel
justified in this, for I have so complete a reliance on your
judgment that I feel certain that I should have bowed to your

on to say that the passage in ques-

one to Fritz Muller in the interior of Brazil. By the way, let
me add that I discussed bud-variation chiefly from a belief
which is common to several persons, that all variability is
related to sexual generation ; I wished to show clearly that
this was an error.

influence of the Geological features of the country on the
mind and habits of the Ancient Athenians,* and for your
very obliging letter. I am delighted to hear that you intend
to consider the relations of fossil animals in connection with
their genealogy ; it will afford you a fine field for the exercise
of your extensive knowledge and powers of reasoning. Your
belief will I suppose, at present, lower you in the estimation
of your countrymen ; but judging from the rapid spread in
all parts of Europe, excepting France, of the belief in the
common descent of allied species, I must think that this
belief will before long become universal. How strange it is
that the country which gave birth to Buffon, the elder
Geoffrey, and especially to Lamarck, should now cling
so pertinaciously to the belief that species are immutable
creations.

must forgive me for not having sooner thanked you for your
paper on  Man,t received on the 1 ith. But first let me say
that I have hardly ever in my life been more struck by any
paper than that on  Variation, &c. See., in the Reader. \ I feel
sure that such papers will do more for the spreading of

our views on the modification of species than any separate
Treatises on the simple subject itself. It is really admirable ;
but you ought not in the Man paper to speak of the theory
as mine ; it is just as much yours as mine. One correspondent
has already noticed to me your  high-minded  conduct on
this head. But now for your Man paper, about which I
should like to write more than I can. The great leading
idea is quite new to me, viz. that during late ages, the mind
will have been modified more than the body ; yet I had got
as far as to see with you, that the struggle between the races
of man depended entirely on intellectual and moral qualities.
The latter part of the paper I can designate only as grand
and most eloquently done. I have shown your paper to two
or three persons who have been here, and they have been
equally struck with it I am not sure that I go with you on
all minor points : when reading Sir G. Greys account of the
constant battles of Australian savages, I remember thinking
that natural selection would come in, and likewise with the
Esquimaux, with whom the art of fishing and managing canoes
is said to be hereditary. I rather differ on the rank, under
a classificatory point of view, which you assign to man ; I do
not think any character simply in excess ought ever to be
used for the higher divisions. Ants would not be separated
from other hymenopterous insects, however high the instinct
of the one, and however low the instincts of the other. With
respect to the differences of race, a conjecture has occurred
to me that much may be due to the correlation of complexion
(and consequently hair) with constitution. Assume that a
dusky individual best escaped miasma, and you will readily
see what I mean. I persuaded the Director-General of the
Medical Department of the Army to send printed forms to
the surgeons of all regiments in tropical countries to ascertain
this point, but I dare say I shall never get any returns.
Secondly, I suspect that a sort of sexual selection has been

the most powerful means of changing the races of man. I
can show that the different races have a widely different
standard of beauty. Among savages the most powerful men
will have the pick of the women, and they will generally leave
the most descendants. I have collected a few notes on man,
but I do not suppose that I shall ever use them. Do you
intend to follow out your views, and if so, would you like at
some future time to have my few references and notes ? I
am sure I hardly know whether they are of any value, and
they are at present in a state of chaos.
There is much more that I should like to write, but I have
not strength.
Believe me, dear Wallace, yours very sincerely,
C. Darwin.
P.S.  Our aristocracy is handsomer (more hideous accord-
ing to a Chinese or Negro) than the middle classes, from
[having the] pick of the women ; but oh, what a scheme is
primogeniture for destroying natural selection ! I fear my
letter will be barely intelligible to you.
[In February 1867, when the manuscript of  Animals and
CTTXTHR Plants  had been sent to Messrs. Clowes to be printed, and
before the proofs began to come in, he had an interval of spare
time, and began a  chapter on Man, but he soon found it
growing under his hands, and determined to publish it
separately as a  very small volume.
The work was interrupted by the necessity of correcting
the proofs of  Animals and Plants, and by some botanical
work, but was resumed with unremitting industry on the first
available day in the following year. He could not rest, and
he recognized with regret the gradual change in his mind
that rendered continuous work more and more necessary to
him as he grew older. This is expressed in a letter to Sir
J. D. Hooker, June 17, 1868, which repeats to some extent
what is given in the Autobiography :

WORK ON MAN.

 I am glad you were at the  Messiah, it is the one thing
that I should like to hear again, but I dare say I should find
my soul too dried up to appreciate it as in old days ; and
then I should feel very flat, for it is a horrid bore to feel as I
constantly do, that I am a withered leaf for every subject
except Science. It sometimes makes me hate Science, though
God knows I ought to be thankful for such a perennial
interest, which makes me forget for some hours every day my
accursed stomach.
The work on Man was interrupted by illness in the early
summer of 1868, and he left home on July 16th for Fresh-
water, in the Isle of Wight, where he remained with his
family until August 21st. Here he made the acquaintance
of Mrs. Cameron. She received the whole family with
open-hearted kindness and hospitality, and my father always
retained a warm feeling of friendship for her. She made
an excellent photograph of him, which was published with
the inscription written by him :  I like this photograph
very much better than any other which has been taken
of me. Further interruption occurred in the autumn, so
that continuous work on the  Descent of Man  did not
begin until 1869. The following letters give some idea of
the earlier work in 1867 : ]

points which require investigation, such as the relative
number of the two sexes, and especially on polygamy.

cases? Many gallinaceous birds certainly are polygamous.
I suppose that birds may be known not to be polygamous
if they are seen during the whole breeding season to asso-
ciate in pairs, or if the male incubates or aids in feeding
the young. Will you have the kindness to turn this in your
mind ? But it is a shame to trouble you now that, as I am
heartily glad to hear, you are at work on your Malayan
travels. I am fearfully puzzled how far to extend your
protective views with respect to the females in various
classes. The more I work, the more important sexual
selection apparently comes out

Dear Wallace,  I much regretted that I was unable to
call on you, but after Monday I was unable even to leave the
house. On Monday evening I called on Bates, and put a
difficulty before him, which he could not answer, and, as on
some former similar occasion, his first suggestion was,  You
had better ask Wallace. My difficulty is, why are cater-
pillars sometimes so beautifully and artistically coloured?
Seeing that many are coloured to escape danger, I can hardly
attribute their bright colour in other cases to mere physical
conditions. Bates says the most gaudy caterpillar he ever
saw in Amazonia (of a sphinx) was conspicuous at the
distance of yards, from its black and red colours, whilst
feeding on large green leaves. If any one objected to male
butterflies having been made beautiful by sexual selection,

well as their caterpillars, what would you answer ? I could
not answer, but should maintain my ground. Will you think
over this, and some time, either by letter or when we meet,
tell me what you think ? Also I want to know whether your
female mimetic butterfly is more beautiful and brighter than
the male. When next in London I must get you to show me
your kingfishers. My health is a dreadful evil ; I failed in
half my engagements during this last visit to London.
Believe me, yours very sincerely,
C. Darwin.
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to A. R. Wallace.
Down, February 26 [1867],
My DEAR Wallace,  Bates was quite right ; you are the
man to apply to in a difficulty. I never heard anything
more ingenious than your suggestion* and I hope you may
be able to prove it true. That is a splendid fact about the
white moths ; it warms ones very blood to see a theory thus
almost proved to be true.f With respect to the beauty of
male butterflies, I must as yet think that it is due to sexual
selection. There is some evidence that dragon-flies are
attracted by bright colours ; but what leads me to the above
belief, is so many male Orthoptera and Cicadas having
musical instruments. This being the case, the analogy of
birds makes me believe in sexual selection with respect to
colour in insects. I wish I had strength and time to make
some of the experiments suggested by you, but I thought
butterflies would not pair in confinement I am sure I have
heard of some such difficulty. Many years ago I had a

dragon-fly painted with gorgeous colours, but I never had an
opportunity of fairly trying it.
The reason of my being so much interested just at present
about sexual selection is, that I have almost resolved to
publish a little essay on the origin of Mankind, and I still
strongly think (though I failed to convince you, and this, to
me, is the heaviest blow possible) that sexual selection has
been the main agent in forming the races of man.
By the way, there is another subject which I shall intro-
duce in my essay, namely, expression of countenance. Now,
do you happen to know by any odd chance a very good-
natured and acute observer in the Malay Archipelago, who
you think would make a few easy observations for me on the
expression of the Malays when excited by various emotions?
For in this case I would send to such person a list of queries.
I thank you for your most interesting letter, and remain,
Yours very sincerely,
C. Darwin.

My dear Wallace,  I thank you much for your two
notes. The case of Julia Pastrana* is a splendid addition to
my other cases of correlated teeth and hair, and I will add it
in correcting the press of my present volume. Pray let me
hear in the course of the summer if you get any evidence
about the gaudy caterpillars. I should much like to give
(or quote if published) this idea of yours, if in any way sup-
ported, as suggested by you. It will, however, be a long
time hence, for I can see that sexual selection is growing
into quite a large subject, which I shall introduce into my
essay on Man, supposing that I ever publish it. I had

intended giving a chapter on man, inasmuch as many call
him (not quite truly) an eminently domesticated animal, but
I found the subject too large for a chapter. Nor shall I be
capable of treating the subject well, and my sole reason for
taking it up is, that I am pretty well convinced that sexual
selection has played an important part in the formation of
races, and sexual selection has always been a subject which
has interested me much. I have been very glad to see your
impression from memory on the expression of Malays. I
fully agree with you that the subject is in no way an im-
portant one ; it is simply a  hobby-horse  with me, about
twenty-seven years old ; and After thinking that I would write
an essay on Man, it flashed on me that I could work in some
supplemental remarks on expression. After the horrid,
tedious, dull work of my present huge, and I fear unreadable,
book [The Variation of Animals and Plants], I thought
I would amuse myself with my hobby-horse. The subject is,
I think, more curious and more amenable to scientific treat-
ment than you seem willing to allow. I want, anyhow, to
upset Sir C. Bells view, given in his most interesting work,
 The Anatomy of Expression, that certain muscles have
been given to man solely that he may reveal to other men
his feelings. I want to try and show how expressions have
arisen. That is a good suggestion about newspapers, but my
experience tells me that private applications are generally
most fruitful. I will, however, see if I can get the queries
inserted in some Indian paper. I do not know the names or
addresses of any other papers.

many thanks,

. . . Many thanks for all the curious facts about the unequal
number of the sexes in Crustacea, but the more I investigate
this subject the deeper I sink in doubt and difficulty. Thanks
also for the confirmation of the rivalry of Cicadae. I have
often reflected with surprise on the diversity of the means for
producing music with insects, and still more with birds. We
thus get a high idea of the importance of song in the animal
kingdom. Please to tell me where I can find any account
of the auditory organs in the Orthoptera. Your facts are
quite new to me. Scudder has described an insect in the
Devonian strata, furnished with a stridulating apparatus.
I believe he is to be trusted, and, if so, the apparatus is of
astonishing antiquity. After reading Landoiss paper I have
been working at the stridulating organ in the Lamellicom
beetles, in expectation of finding it sexual ; but I have only
found it as yet in two cases, and in these it was equally de-
veloped in both sexes. I wish you would look at any of
your common Lamellicoms, and take hold of both males
and females, and observe whether they make the squeaking
or grating noise equally. If they do not, you could, perhaps,
send me a male and female in a light little box. How
curious it is that there should be a special organ for an object
apparently so unimportant as squeaking. Here is another
point; have you any toucans? if so, ask any trustworthy
hunter whether the beaks of the males, or of both sexes,
are more brightly coloured during the breeding season than
at other times of the year. . . . Heaven knows whether I

My DEAR Sir,  I return you my sincere thanks for your
long letter, which I consider a great compliment, and which
is quite full of most interesting facts and views. Your
references and remarks will be of great use should a new
edition of my book * be demanded, but this is hardly prob-
able, for the whole edition was sold within the first week,
and another large edition immediately reprinted, which I
should think would supply the demand for ever. You ask
me when I shall publish on the Variation of Species in
a State of Nature. I have had the MS. for another volume
almost ready during several years, but I was so much
fatigued by my last book that I determined to amuse myself
by publishing a short essay on the  Descent of Man. I was
partly led to do this by having been taunted that I concealed
my views, but chiefly from the interest which I had long
taken in the subject Now this essay has branched out into
some collateral subjects, and I suppose will take me more
than a year to complete. I shall then begin on Species,
but my health makes me a very slow workman. I hope that
you will excuse these details, which I have given to show

that you will have plenty of time to publish your views first,
which will be a great advantage to me. Of all the curious
facts which you mention in your letter, I think that of the
strong inheritance of the scalp-muscles has interested me
most. I presume that you would not object to my giving
this very curious case on your authority. As I believe all
anatomists look at the scalp-muscles as a remnant of the
Panniculus carnosus which is common to all the lower
quadrupeds, I should look at the unusual development and
inheritance of these muscles as probably a case of reversion.
Your observation on so many remarkable men in noble
families having been illegitimate is extremely curious ; and
should I ever meet any one capable of writing an essay on
this subject I will mention your remarks as a good sugges-
tion. Dr. Hooker has several times remarked to me that
morals and politics would be very interesting if discussed like
any branch of natural history, and this is nearly to the same
effect with your remarks. . . .

indelicate in me to have asked for information from you, but
it never occurred to me that my letter would have been
shown to you. I have never for a moment doubted your
kindness and generosity, and I hope you will not think it
presumption in me to say, that when we met, many years
ago, at the British Association at Southampton, I felt for you
the warmest admiration.

rejoice at all your bothering labour and anxiety having had
so grand an end. I must say a word about myself ; never
has such a eulogium been passed on me, and it makes me
very proud. I cannot get over my amazement at what you
say about my botanical work. By Jove, as far as my
memory goes, you have strengthened instead of weakened
some of the expressions. What is far more important than
anything personal, is the conviction which I feel, that you
will have immensely advanced the belief in the evolution of
species. This will follow from the publicity of the occasion,
your position, so responsible, as President, and your own high
reputation. It will make a great step in public opinion, I feel
sure, and I had not thought of this before. The A thenceum

the Marquis de Saporta, the eminent palseo- botanist, refers
to the growth of Evolutionary views in France :
As I have formerly read with great interest many of your
papers on fossil plants, you may believe with what high
satisfaction I hear that you are a believer in the gradual
evolution of species. I had supposed that my book on the
 Origin of Species  had made very little impression in France,
and therefore it delights me to hear a different statement
from you. All the great authorities of the Institute seem
firmly resolved to believe in the immutability of species, and
this has always astonished me. . . . Almost the one exception,
as far as I know, is M. Gaudry, and I think he will be soon
one of the chief leaders in Zoological Palaeontology in
Europe ; and now I am delighted to hear that in the sister
department of Botany you take nearly the same view.]

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to E. Haeckel.
Down, Nov. 19 [1868].
My DEAR HAECKEL,  I must write to you again, for two
reasons. Firstly, to thank you for your letter about your
baby, which has quite charmed both me and my wife; I
heartily congratulate you on its birth. I remember being
surprised in my own case how soon the paternal instincts
became developed, and in you they seem to be unusually
strong, ... I hope the large blue eyes and the principles of
inheritance will make your child as good a naturalist as you
are ; but, judging from my own experience, you will be
astonished to find how the whole mental disposition of your
children changes with advancing years. A young child, and
the same when nearly grown, sometimes differ almost as much
as do a caterpillar and butterfly.
The second point is to congratulate you on the projected
translation of your great work* about which I heard from
Huxley last Sunday. I am heartily glad of it, but how it has
been brought about, I know not, for a friend who supported
the proposed translation at Norwich, told me he thought
there would be no chance of it Huxley tells me that you
consent to omit and shorten some parts, and I am confident
that this is very wise. As I know your object is to instruct
the public, you will assuredly thus get many more readers
in England. Indeed, I believe that almost every book
would be improved by condensation. I have been reading a
good deal of your last book,f and the style is beautifully
clear and easy to me; but why it should differ so much
in this respect from your great work I cannot imagine. I
have not yet read the first part, but began with the
chapter on Lyell and myself, which you will easily believe

pleased me very much. I think Lyell, who was apparently
much pleased by your sending him a copy, is also much
gratified by this chapter.* Your chapters on the affinities and
genealogy of the animal kingdom strike me as admirable
and full of original thought. Your boldness, however,
sometimes makes me tremble, but as Huxley remarked,
some one must be bold enough to make a beginning in
drawing up tables of descent. Although you fully admit the
imperfection of the geological record, yet Huxley agreed with
me in thinking that you are sometimes rather rash in venturing
to say at what periods the several groups first appeared. I have
this advantage over you, that I remember how wonderfully
different any statement on this subject made 20 years ago,
would have been to what would now be the case, and I
expect the next 20 years will make quite as great a difference.
Reflect on the monocotyledonous plant just discovered in the
primordial formation in Sweden.
I repeat how glad I am at the prospect of the translation,
for I fully believe that this work and all your works will
have a great influence in the advancement of Science.
Believe me, my dear Hackcl, your sincere friend,
Charles Darwik.

Mr. Woolner, I should say that the point in which the bust
fails somewhat as a portrait, is that it has a certain air, almost
of pomposity, which seems to me foreign to my fathers
expression.]
1869.
[At the beginning of the year he was at work in preparing
the fifth edition of the  Origin. This work was begun on
the day after Christmas, 1868, and was continued for forty-
six days, as he notes in his diary, i.e. until February 10th,
1869. CTTXTHR He then, February nth, returned to Sexual Selection,
and continued at this subject (excepting for ten days given
up to Orchids, and a week in , London), until June 10th,
when he went with his family to North Wales, where he
remained about seven weeks, returning to Down on July 31st
Caerdeon, the house where he stayed, is built on the north
shore of the beautiful Barmouth estuary, and is pleasantly
placed in being close to wild hill country behind, as well as
to the picturesque wooded  hummocks," between the steeper
hills and the river. My father was ill and somewhat depressed
throughout this visit, and I think felt saddened at being
imprisoned by his want of strength, and unable even to reach
the hills over which he had once wandered for days together.
CTTXTHR He wrote from Caerdeon to Sir J. D. Hooker (June 22nd)
We have been here for ten days, how I wish it was
possible for you to pay us a visit here ; we have a beautiful
house with a terraced garden, and a really magnificent view
of Cader, right opposite. Old Cader is a grand fellow, and
shows himself off superbly with every changing light. We
remain here till the end of July, when the H. Wedgwoods
have the house. I have been as yet in a very poor way ; it
seems as soon as the stimulus of mental work stops, my
whole strength gives way. As yet I have hardly crawled half
a mile from the house, and then have been fearfully fatigued.
It is enough to make one wish oneself quiet in a comfortable

FLEEMING JENKIN.
107
With regard to the fifth edition of the * Origin, he wrote to
Mr. Wallace, January 22, 1869) :
" I have been interrupted in my regular work in preparing
a new edition of the  Origin, which has cost me much labour,
and which I hope I have considerably improved in two or
three important points. I always thought individual differ-
ences more important than single variations, but now I have
come to the conclusion that they are of paramount import-
ance, and in this I believe I agree with you. Fleeming
Jenkins arguments have convinced me.
This somewhat obscure sentence was explained, February 2,
in another letter to Mr. Wallace :
 I must have expressed myself atrociously ; I meant to
say exactly the reverse of what you have understood.
F. Jenkin argued in the * North British Review  against single
variations ever being perpetuated, and has convinced me,
though not in quite so broad a manner as here put. I always
thought individual differences more important ; but I was
blind and thought that single variations might be preserved
much oftener than I now see is possible or probable. I men-
tioned this in my former note merely because I believed that
you had come to a similar conclusion, and I like much to be
in accord with you. I believe I was mainly deceived by
single variations offering such simple illustrations, as when
The late Mr. Fleeming Jenkins review, on the Origin of
Species, was published in the  North British Review  for June
1867. It is not a little remarkable that the criticisms, which
my father, as I believe, felt to be the most valuable ever
made on his views should have come, not from a professed
naturalist but from a Professor of Engineering.
It is impossible to give in a short compass an account of
Fleeming Jenkin's argument. My fathers copy of the paper
(ripped out of the volume as usual, and tied with a bit of
string) is annotated in pencil in many places. I may quote
WORK ON MAN.'

one passage opposite which my father has written good
sneers   but it should be remembered that he used the word
sneer" in rather a special sense, not as necessarily implying
a feeling of bitterness in the critic, but rather in the sense
of  banter. Speaking of the * true believer, Fleeming Jenkin
says, p. 293
 He can invent trains of ancestors of whose existence
there is no evidence ; he can marshal hosts of equally imagi-
nary foes ; he can call up continents, floods, and peculiar
atmospheres ; he can dry up oceans, split islands, and parcel
out eternity at will ; surely with these advantages he must be
a dull fellow if he cannot scheme some series of animals and
circumstances explaining our assumed difficulty quite natur-
ally. Feeling the difficulty of dealing with adversaries who
command so huge a domain of fancy, we will abandon these
arguments, and trust to those which at least cannot be assailed
by mere efforts of imagination.
In the fifth edition of the  Origin, my father altered a
passage in the Historical Sketch (fourth edition, p. xviii). He
thus practically gave up the difficult task of understanding
whether or not Sir R. Owen claims to have discovered the
principle of Natural Selection. Adding, As far as the mere
enunciation of the principle of Natural Selection is concerned,
it is quite immaterial whether or not Professor Owen preceded
me, for both of us . . . were long ago preceded by Dr. Wells
and Mr. Matthew."
A somewhat severe critique on the fifth edition, by Mr. John
Robertson, appeared in the A thenceum, August 14, 1869.
The writer comments with some little bitterness on the
success of the ' Origin  Attention is not acceptance. Many
editions do not mean real success. The book has sold ; the
guess has been talked over ; and the circulation and discus-
sion sum up the significance of the editions. Mr. Robertson
makes the true, but misleading statement: Mr. Darwin
prefaces his fifth English edition with an Essay, which he
lS6p.] FIFTH EDITION OF THE ORIGIN. I09
calls An Historical Sketch, &c. As a matter of fact a
Sketch appeared in the third edition in l86r.
Mr. Robertson goes on to say that the Sketch ought to be
called a collection of extracts anticipatory or corroborative of
the hypothesis of Natural Selection. For no account is
given of any hostile opinions. The fact is very significant.
This historical sketch thus resembles the histories of the reign
of Louis XVIII., published after the Restoration, from which
the Republic and the Empire, Robespierre and Buonaparte
were omitted.
CTTXTHR The following letter to Prof. Victor Cams gives an idea of
the character of the new edition of the * Origin : ]
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to Victor Carus.
Down, May 4, 1869.
... I have gone very carefully through the whole, trying to
make some parts clearer, and adding a few discussions and
facts of some importance. The new edition is only two pages
at the end longer than the old ; though in one part nine pages
in advance, for I have condensed several parts and omitted
some passages. The translation I fear will cause you a great
deal of trouble ; the alterations took me six weeks, besides
correcting the press ; you ought to make a special agreement
with M. Koch [the publisher]. Many of the corrections are
only a few words, but they have been made from the evidence
on various points appearing to have become a little stronger
Thus I have been led to place somewhat more value on
the definite and direct action of external conditions ; to think
the lapse of time, as measured by years, not quite so great as
most geologists have thought ; and to infer that single varia-
tions are of even less importance, in comparison with indi-
vidual differences, than I formerly thought I mention these
points because I have been thus led to alter in many places
a few words ; and unless you go through the whole new

edition, one part will not agree with another, which would be
a great blemish. . . .
[The desire that his views might spread in France was
always strong with my father, and he was therefore justly
annoyed to find that in 1869 the publisher of the first French
edition had brought out a third edition without consulting
the author. He was accordingly glad to enter into an
arrangement for a French translation of the fifth edition ; this
was undertaken by M. Reinwald, with whom he continued
to have pleasant relations as the publisher of many of his
books into French.
CTTXTHR He wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker :
 I must enjoy myself and tell you about Mdlle. C. Royer,
who translated the ' Origin  into French, and for whose
second edition I took infinite trouble. She has now just
brought out a third edition without informing me, so that all
the corrections, &c., in the fourth and fifth English editions
are lost. Besides her enormously long preface to the first
edition, she has added a second preface abusing me like a
pickpocket for Pangenesis, which of course has no relation to
the  CTTXTHR Origin. So I wrote to Paris ; and Reinwald agrees to
bring out at once a new translation from the fifth English
edition, in competition with her third edition. . . . This fact
shows that  evolution of species  must at last be spreading

if a layman had delivered the same address, he would have
done good service in spreading what, as I hope and believe, is
to a large extent the truth ; but a clergyman in delivering such

be permitted to say so, an admirable example of liberality.

[The references to the subject of expression in the following

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to F. Muller.
Down, February 22, [1869?]
. . . Although you have aided me to so great an extent in
many ways, I am going to beg for any information on two other
subjects. I am preparing a discussion on  Sexual Selection,
and I want much to know how low down in the animal scale
sexual selection of a particular kind extends. Do you know
of any lowly organised animals, in which the sexes are
separated, and in which the male differs from the female in
arms of offence, like the horns and tusks of male mammals, or
in gaudy plumage and ornaments, as with birds and butter-
flies? I do not refer to secondary sexual characters, by which
the male is able to discover the female, like the plumed
antennae of moths, or by which the male is enabled to seize
the female, like the curious pincers described by you in some
of the lower Crustaceans. But what I want to know is, how
low in the scale sexual differences occur which require some
degree of self-consciousness in the males, as weapons by

which they fight for the female, or ornaments which attract
the opposite sex. Any differences between males and females
which follow different habits of life would have to be ex-
cluded. I think you will easily see what I wish to learn. A
priori , it would never have been anticipated that insects
would have been attracted by the beautiful colouring of the
opposite sex, or by the sounds emitted by the various musical
instruments of the male Orthoptera. I know no one so likely
to answer this question as yourself, and should be grateful for
any information, however small.
My second subject refers to expression of countenance, to
which I have long attended, and on which I feel a keen
interest ; but to which, unfortunately, I did not attend, when
I had the opportunity of observing various races of man. It
has occurred to me that you might, without much trouble,
make a few observations for me, in the course of some
months, on Negroes, or possibly on native South Americans,
though I care most about Negroes ; accordingly I enclose
some questions as a guide, and if you could answer me even
one or two I should feel truly obliged. I am thinking of
writing a little essay on the Origin of Mankind, as I have been
taunted with concealing my opinions, and I should do this
immediately after the completion of my present book. In
this case I should add a chapter on the cause or meaning of
expression. . . .

your risks from illness and sea voyages, especially that most
interesting one to Waigiou and back. Of all the impressions
which I have received from your book, the strongest is that
your perseverance in the cause of science was heroic. Your
descriptions of catching the splendid butterflies have made
me quite envious, and at the same time have made me feel
almost young again, so vividly have they brought before my
mind old days when I collected, though I never made such
captures as yours. Certainly collecting is the best sport in
the world. I shall be astonished if your book has not a great
success ; and your splendid generalizations on Geographical
Distribution, with which I am familiar from your papers, will
be new to most of your readers. I think I enjoyed most the
Timor case, as it is best demonstrated : but perhaps Celebes
is really the most valuable. I should prefer looking at the
whole Asiatic continent as having formerly been more African
in its fauna, than admitting the former existence of a con-
tinent across the Indian Ocean. . . .

a striking passage on Sir Charles Lyell's confession of evolu-

worth quoting :  The history of science hardly presents so

we shall be convinced that so great a change was not decided
on without long and anxious deliberation, and that the views
now adopted must indeed be supported by arguments of over-
whelming force. If for no other reason than that Sir Charles
Lyell in his tenth edition has adopted it, the theory of Mr.
Darwin deserves an attentive and respectful consideration
from every earnest seeker after truth.]
C. CTTXTHR Dartuin to A. R. Wallace.
Down, April 14, 1869.
My dear Wallace,  I have been wonderfully interested
by your article, and I should think Lyell will be much
gratified by it I declare if I had been editor, and had the
power of directing you, I should have selected for discussion
the very points which you have chosen. I have often said to
younger geologists (for I began in the year 1830) that they
did not know what a revolution Lyell had effected ; neverthe-
less, your extracts from Cuvier have quite astonished me.
Though not able really to judge, I am inclined to put more
confidence in Croll than you seem to do; but I have been
much struck by many of your remarks on degradation.
Thomsons views of the recent age of the world have been for
some time one of my sorest troubles, and so I have been glad
to read what you say. Your exposition of Natural Selection
seems to me inimitably good ; there never lived a better
expounder than you. I was also much pleased at your
discussing the difference between our views and Lamarcks.
One sometimes sees the odious expression, "Justice to myself
compels me to say, &c., but you are the only man I ever
heard of who persistently does himself an injustice, and never
demands justice. Indeed, you ought in the review to have
alluded to your paper in the Linnean Journal, and I feel
sure all our friends will agree in this. But you cannot

seen in half the articles which appear. I was asked but the
other day by a German professor for your paper, which I
sent him. Altogether I look at your article as appearing in
the  Quarterly  as an immense triumph for our cause. I pre-
sume that your remarks on Man are those to which you
alluded in your note. If you had not told me I should have
thought that they had been added by some one else. As you
expected, I differ grievously from you, and I am very sorry
for it. I can see no necessity for calling in an additional and
proximate cause in regard to man.* But the subject is too
long for a letter. I have been particularly glad to read your
discussion because I am now writing and thinking much
about man.
I hope that your Malay book sells well ; I was extremely
pleased with the article in the Quarterly Journal of Science,'
inasmuch as it is thoroughly appreciative of your work : alas!
you will probably agree with what the writer says about the
uses of the bamboo.

me. When I had finished the second part, I thought that

ing the subsequent parts I had to change my sanguine view.
In these latter parts many of your strictures are severe
enough, but all are given with perfect courtesy and fairness.
I can truly say I would rather be criticised by you in this
manner than praised by many others. I agree with some of
your criticisms, but differ entirely from the remainder ; but I
will not trouble you with any remarks. I may, however, say,
that you must have been deceived by the French translation, as
you infer that I belie ve that the Parus and the N uthatch (or Sitta)
are related by direct filiation. I wished only to show, by an
imaginary illustration, how either instincts or structures might
first change. If you had seen Catiis Magellauicus alive you
would have perceived how foxlike its appearance is, or if you
had heard its voice, I think that you would never have
hazarded the idea that it was a domestic dog run wild ; but
this does not much concern me. It is curious how nationality
influences opinion ; a week hardly passes without my hearing
of some naturalist in Germany who supports my views, and
often puts an exaggerated value on my works ; whilst in
France I have not heard of a single zoologist, except M.
Gaudry (and he only partially), who supports my views. But
I must have a good many readers as my books are translated,
and I must hope, notwithstanding your strictures, that I may
influence some embryo naturalists in France.
You frequently speak of my good faith, and no compliment
can be more delightful to me, but I may return you the
compliment with interest, for every word which you write
bears the stamp of your cordial love for the truth. Believe
me, dear Sir, with sincere respect,

My DEAR Huxley,  I have been delighted to see your
review of Hackel,* and as usual you pile honours high on my
head. But I write now ( requiring no answer) to groan a little
over what you have said about rudimentary organs, f Many
heretics will take advantage of what you have said. I cannot
but think that the explanation given at p. 541 of the last
edition of the  Origin, of the long retention of rudimentary
organs and of their greater relative size during early life, is
satisfactory. Their final and complete abortion seems to me
a much greater difficulty. Do look in my * Variations under
Domestication, vol. iL p. 397, at what Pangenesis suggests on
this head, though I did not dare to put it in the  Origin.
The passage bears also a little on the struggle between the
molecules or gemmules.J There is likewise a word or two
indirectly bearing on this subject at pp. 394-395- It wont
take you five minutes, so do look at these passages. I am
very glad that you have been bold enough to give your idea
about Natural Selection amongst the molecules, though I
cannot quite follow you.

Down, March 15 [1870].
My DEAR Sir,  I do not know whether you will consider
me a very troublesome man, but I have just finished your
book,* and cannot resist telling you how the whole has much
interested me. No doubt, as you say, there must be much
speculation on such a subject, and certain results cannot be
reached ; but all your views are highly suggestive, and to my
mind that is high praise. I have been all the more interested,
as I am now writing on closely allied though not quite identi-
cal points. I was pleased to see you refer to my much
despised child,  Pangenesis, who I think will some day, under
some better nurse, turn out a fine stripling. It has also
pleased me to see how thoroughly you appreciate (and I do
not think that this is general with the men of science)
H. Spencer ; I suspect that hereafter he will be looked at as
by far the greatest living philosopher in England ; perhaps
equal to any that have lived. But I have no business to
trouble you with my notions. With sincere thanks for the
interest which your work has given me,
I remain, yours very faithfully,
C. Darwin.

My dear Wallace,  I have just received your book,
and read the preface. There never has been passed on me, or
indeed on any one, a higher eulogium than yours. I wish
that I fully deserved it Your modesty and candour are very
far from new to me. I hope it is a satisfaction to you to
reflect  and very few things in my life have been more satis-
factory to me  that we have never felt any jealousy towards
each other, though in one sense rivals. I believe that I can
say this of myself with truth, and I am absolutely sure that
it is true of you.
You have been a good Christian to give a list of your
additions, for I want much to read them, and I should hardly
have had time just at present to have gone through all your
articles. Of course I shall immediately read those that are
new or greatly altered, and I will endeavour to be as honest
as can reasonably be expected. Your book looks remarkably
well got up.
Believe me, my dear Wallace, to remain,

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to A. R. Wallace.
Down, September 23 [undated].
My DEAR WALLACE,  I am very much obliged for all your
trouble in writing me your long letter, which I will keep by
me and ponder over. To answer it would require at least
200 folio pages 1 If you could see how often I have re-written
some pages you would know how anxious I am to arrive as
near as I can to the truth. I lay great stress on what I know
takes place under domestication; I think we start with
different fundamental notions on inheritance. I find it is
most difficult, but not I think impossible, to see how, for
instance, a few red feathers appearing on the head of a
male bird, and which are at first tratismitted to both sexes,
could come to be transmitted to males alone. It is not
enough that females should be produced from the males
with red feathers, which should be destitute of red feathers ;
but these females must have a latent tendency to produce
such feathers, otherwise they would cause deterioration
in the red head-feathers of their male offspring. Such
124 WORK ON MAN. [187a
latent tendency would be shown by their producing the
red feathers when old, or diseased in their ovaria. But
I have no difficulty in making the whole head red if the
few red feathers in the male from the first tended to be
sexually transmitted. I am quite willing to admit that the
female may have been modified, either at the same time
or subsequently, for protection by the accumulation of varia-
tions limited in their transmission to the female sex. I owe to
your writings the consideration of this latter point But I
cannot yet persuade myself that females alone have often
been modified for protection. Should you grudge the trouble
briefly to tell me, whether you believe that the plainer head
and less bright colours of ? chaffinch* the less red on the head
and less clean colours of ? goldfinch, the much less red on
the breast of ? bullfinch, the paler crest of golden-crested
wren, &c., have been acquired by them for protection. I
cannot think so, any more than I can that the considerable
differences between $ and $ house sparrow, or much greater
brightness of $ Parus cceruleus (both of which build under
cover) than of ? Parus , are related to protection. I even
misdoubt much whether the less blackness of 9 blackbird is
for protection.
Again, can you give me reasons for believing that the
moderate differences between the female pheasant, the female
Gallus bankiva, the female of black grouse, the pea-hen, the
female partridge, have all special references to protection under
slightly different conditions ? I, of course, admit that they are
all protected by dull colours, derived, as I think, from some
dull-ground progenitor ; and I account partly for their
difference by partial transference of colour from the male,
and by other means too long to specify ; but I earnestly wish
to see reason to believe that each is specially adapted for
concealment to its environment.
I grieve to differ from you, and it actually terrifies me and

makes me constantly distrust myself. I fear we shall never
quite understand each other. I value the cases of bright-
coloured, incubating male fishes, and brilliant female butter-
flies, solely as showing that one sex may be made brilliant
without any necessary transference of beauty to the other
sex ; for in these cases I cannot suppose that beauty in the
other sex was checked by selection.
I fear this letter will trouble you to read it A very short
answer about your belief in regard to the ? finches and
gallinaceae would suffice.

.... Last Friday we all went to the Bull Hotel at
Cambridge to see the boys, and for a little rest and enjoyment.
The backs of the Colleges are simply paradisaical. On
Monday I saw Sedgwick, who was most cordial and kind ; in
the morning I thought his brain was enfeebled ; in the evening
he was brilliant and quite himself. His affection and kind-
ness charmed us all. My visit to him was in one way un-
fortunate ; for after a long sit he proposed to take me to the
museum, and I could not refuse, and in consequence he utterly
prostrated me ; so that we left Cambridge next morning, and
I have not recovered the exhaustion yet. Is it not humiliating
to be thus killed by a man of eighty-six, who evidently never
dreamed that he was killing me ? As he said to me,  Oh, I
consider you as a mere baby to me !  I saw Newton several
times, and several nice friends of F.s. But Cambridge with-

My dear Sulivan,  It was very good of you to write to
me so long a letter, telling me much about yourself and your
children, which I was extremely glad to hear. Think what a
benighted wretch I am, seeing no one and reading but little
in the newspapers, for I did not know (until seeing the paper
of your Natural History Society) that you were a K.C.B.
Most heartily glad I am that the Government have at last
appreciated your most just claim for this high distinction. On
the other hand, I am sorry to hear so poor an account of your
health ; but you were surely very rash to do all that you did
and then pass through so exciting a scene as a ball at the
Palace. It was enough to have tired a man in robust health.
Complete rest will, however, I hope, quite set you up again.
As for myself, I have been rather better of late, and if nothing
disturbs me I can do some hours work every day. I shall
this autumn publish another book partly on man, which I
dare say many will decry as very wicked. I could have
travelled to Oxford, but could no more have withstood the
excitement of a commemoration f than I could a ball at
Buckingham Palace. Many thanks for your kind remarks
about my boys. Thank God, all give me complete satisfac-

[My fathers connection with the South American Mission,

public comment, and has been to some extent misunder-

annual meeting of the South American Missionary Society,
April 21st, 1885,* said that the Society drew the attention
of Charles Darwin, and made him, in his pursuit of the
wonders of the kingdom of nature, realise that there was
another kingdom just as wonderful and more lasting.
Some discussion on the subject appeared in the Daily News
of April 23rd, 24th, 29th, 1885, and finally Admiral Sir

proved to him that he had been wrong and I right in our
estimates of the native character, and the possibility of doing
them good through Missionaries ; and he requested me to
forward to the Society an enclosed cheque for ��5, as a
testimony of the interest he took in their good work. On
June 6th, 1874, he wrote :  I am very glad to hear so good
an account of the Fuegians, and it is wonderful On June

129
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to John Lubbock.
Down, July 17, 1870.
My dear Lubbock As I hear that the Census will be
brought before the House to-morrow, I write to say how
much I hope that you will express your opinion on the
desirability of queries in relation to consanguineous marriages
being inserted. As you are aware, I have made experiments
on the subject during several years ; and it is my clear con-
viction that there is now ample evidence of the existence of a
great physiological law, rendering an enquiry with reference to
mankind of much importance. In England and many parts of
Europe the marriages of cousins are objected to from their
supposed injurious consequences ; but this belief rests on no
direct evidence. It is therefore manifestly desirable that the
belief should either be proved false, or should be confirmed, so
that in this latter case the marriages of cousins might be
discouraged. If the proper queries are inserted, the returns
would show whether married cousins have in their households
on the night of the census as many children as have parents
who are not related ; and should the number prove fewer, we
might safely infer either lessened fertility in the parents, or
which is more probable, lessened vitality in the offspring.
It is, moreover, much to be wished that the truth of the
often repeated assertion that consanguineous marriages lead
to deafness, and dumbness, blindness, &c., should be ascer-
tained ; and all such assertions could be easily tested by the
returns from a single census.
Believe me,
Yours very sincerely,
Charles Darwin.
[When the Census Act was passing through the House of
Commons, Sir John Lubbock and Dr. Playfair attempted to
carry out this suggestion. The question came to a division,
which was lost, but not by many votes.

THE EXPRESSION OF THE EMOTIONS.
I87I-1873.
[The last revise of the  Descent of Man  was corrected on
January 15th, 1871, so that the book occupied him for about
three years. CTTXTHR He wrote to Sir J. Hooker: "I finished the
last proofs of my book a few days ago ; the work half-killed
me, and I have not the most remote idea whether the book
is worth publishing.
CTTXTHR He also wrote to Dr. Gray :

lished, I will send you a copy, but I do not know that you

letters of kindred subject-matter, but gives perhaps a truer
picture of the mingled interests and labours of my fathers life.
Nothing can give a better idea (in a small compass) of the
growth of Evolutionism, and its position at this time, than a
quotation from Mr. Huxley*:
 The gradual lapse of time has now separated us by more
than a decade from the date of the publication of the  Origin
of Species ;  and whatever may be thought or said about
Mr. Darwins doctrines, or the manner in which he has pro-
pounded them, this much is certain, that in a dozen years the
* Origin of Species  has worked as complete a revolution in
Biological Science as the  Principia  did in Astronomy ;  and
it has done so, because, in the words of Helmholtz, it
contains  an essentially new creative thought. And, as time
has slipped by, a happy change has come over Mr. Darwin's
critics. The mixture of ignorance and insolence which at
first characterised a large proportion of the attacks with which
he was assailed, is no longer the sad distinction of anti-
Darwinian criticism.
A passage in the Introduction to the  Descent of Man '
shows that the author recognised clearly this improvement in
the position of Evolutionism. When a naturalist like Carl
Vogt ventures to say in his address, as President of the
National Institution of Geneva (1869),  personne, en Europe
au moins, nose plus soutenir la creation indepcndantc et
de toutes pieces, des espfeces, it is manifest that at least
a large number of naturalists must admit that species are
the modified descendants of other species; and this especi-
ally holds good with the younger and rising naturalists.
... Of the older and honoured chiefs in natural science,
many, unfortunately, are still opposed to Evolution in every

he describes a visit to my father  early in 1871,* shortly
after the publication of the  Descent of Man. Mr. Hague
represents my father as  much impressed by the general
assent with which his views had been received, and as
remarking that  everybody is talking about it without being
shocked.
Later in the year the reception of the book is described in
different language in the ' Edinburgh Review  : f  On every
side it is raising a storm of mingled wrath, wonder and
admiration.
With regard to the subsequent reception of the  Descent of
CTTXTHR Man, my father wrote to Dr. Dohm, February 3, 1872 :
"I did not know until reading your article,^ that my
 Descent of Man  had excited so much furore in Germany.
It has had an immense circulation in this country and in
America, but has met the approval of hardly any naturalists
as far as I know. Therefore I suppose it was a mistake on
my part to publish it ; but, anyhow, it will pave the way for
some better work.
The book on the  Expression of the Emotions  was begun
on January 17th, 1871, the last proof of the * Descent of Man
having been finished on January 15th. The rough copy was
finished by April 27th, and shortly after this (in June) the
work was interrupted by the preparation of a sixth edition of
the * Origin. In November and December the proofs of the
Expression book were taken in hand, and occupied him
until the following year, when the book was published.

began to write it. CTTXTHR Thus he wrote to Dr. Asa Gray, April 15,
1867 :
 I have been lately getting up and looking over my old
notes on Expression, and fear that I shall not make so much
of my hobby-horse as I thought I could ; nevertheless, it
seems to me a curious subject which has been strangely
neglected.
It should, however, be remembered that the subject had
been before his mind, more or less, from 1837 or 1838, as
I judge from entries in his early note-books. It was in
December 1839, that he began to make observations on
children.
The work required much correspondence, not only with
missionaries and others living among savages, to whom he
sent his printed queries, but among physiologists and phy-
sicians. He obtained much information from Professor
Donders, Sir W. Bowman, Sir James Paget, Dr. W. Ogle,
Dr. Crichton Browne, as well as from other observers.

January 27, Mr. Wallace wrote :
 Many thanks for your first volume

thank you for the great tenderness

The heresy is the limitation of
natural selection as applied to man.
My father wrote ( Descent of
Man, i. p. 137) :   I cannot there-
fore understand how it is that Mr.
Wallace maintains that natural
selection could only have endowed
the savage with a brain a little
superior to that of an ape. In
the above quoted letter Mr. Wallace
wrote :   Your chapters on  Man '

with the least disrespect, and it is so difficult to speak fairly
when differing from any one. If I had offended you, it
would have grieved me more than you will readily believe.
Secondly, I am greatly pleased to hear that Vol. I. interests
you ; I have got so sick of the whole subject that I felt in
utter doubt about the value of any part. I intended, when
speaking of females not having been specially modified for
protection, to include the prevention of characters acquired
by the $ being transmitted to 9 ; but I now see it would have
been better to have said  specially acted on, or some such term.
Possibly my intention may be clearer in Vol. II. Let me say
that my conclusions are chiefly founded on the consideration
of all animals taken in a body, bearing in mind how common
the rules of sexual differences appear to be in all classes.
The first copy of the chapter on Lepidoptera agreed pretty
closely with you. I then worked on, came back to Lepi-
doptera, and thought myself compelled to alter it  finished
Sexual Selection and for the last time went over Lepidoptera,
and again I felt forced to alter it. I hope to God there will
be nothing disagreeable to you in Vol. II., and that I have
spoken fairly of your views ; I am fearful on this head, because
I have just read (but not with sufficient care) Mivarts book,*
and I feel absolutely certain that he meant to be fair (but he
was stimulated by theological fervour) ; yet I do not think he
has been quite fair. . . . The part which, I think, will have
most influence is where he^gives the whole series of cases like
that of the whalebone, in which we cannot explain the grada-
tional steps ; but such cases have no weight on my mind  if a
few fish were extinct, who on earth would have ventured even
to conjecture that lungs had originated in a swim-bladder?
In such a case as the Thylacine, I think he was bound to say
that the resemblance of the jaw to that of the dog is super-
ficial ; the number and correspondence and development of
teeth being widely different. I think again when speaking

of the necessity of altering a number of characters together,
he ought to have thought of man having power by selection
to modify simultaneously or almost simultaneously many
points, as in making a greyhound or racehorse  as enlarged
upon in my  Domestic Animals. Mivart is savage or con-
temptuous about my  moral sense, and so probably will yon
be. I am extremely pleased that he agrees with my position,
as far as animal nature is concerned, of man in the series ; or
if anything, thinks I have erred in making him too distinct.
Forgive me for scribbling at such length. You have put me
quite in good spirits ; I did so dread having been uninten-
tionally unfair towards your views. I hope earnestly the
second volume will escape as well. I care now very little what
others say. As for our not quite agreeing, really in such
complex subjects, it is almost impossible for two men who
arrive independently at their conclusions to agree fully, it
would be unnatural for them to do so.

My DEAR Wallace,  I have just read your grand review.*
It is in every way as kindly expressed towards myself as it is
excellent in matter. The Lyells have been here, and Sir C.
remarked that no one wrote such good scientific reviews as
you, and as Miss Buckley added, you delight in picking out
all that is good, though very far from blind to the bad. In
all this I most entirely agree. I shall always consider your
review as a great honour ; and however much my book may
hereafter be abused, as no doubt it will be, your review will
console me, notwithstanding that we differ so greatly. I will
keep your objections to my views in my mind, but I fear that
the latter are almost stereotyped in my mind. I thought for
long weeks about the inheritance and selection difficulty, and
covered quires of paper with notes in trying to get out of it,
but could not, though clearly seeing that it would be a great
relief if I could. I will confine myself to two or three
remarks. I have been much impressed with what you urge
against colour, t in the case of insects, having been acquired
tiirlichc Schdpfungs - gcschichte,
in which he fully discusses the
genealogy of man. If this work
had appeared before my essay
had been written, I should pro-
bably never have completed it.
Almost all the conclusions at
which I have arrived, I find con-
firmed by this naturalist, whose
knowledge on many points is much
fuller than mine.
* Academy , March 15, 1871.
f Mr. Wallace says that the pair-
ing of butterflies is probably deter-
mined by the fact that one male is
stronger-winged, or more pertina-
cious than the rest, rather than by
the choice of the females. He
quotes the case of caterpillars which
arc brightly coloured and yet sex-
less. Mr. Wallace also makes the
good criticism, that the  Descent of
Man consists of two books mixed
together.

through sexual selection. I always saw that the evidence
was very weak ; but I still think, if it be admitted that the
musical instruments of insects have been gained through
sexual selection, that there is not the least improbability in
colour having been thus gained. Your argument with respect
to the denudation of mankind and also to insects, that taste
on the part of one sex would have to remain nearly the same
during many generations, in order that sexual selection should
produce any effect, I agree to; and I think this argument
would be sound if used by one who denied that, for instance,
the plumes of birds of Paradise had been so gained. I believe
you admit this, and if so I do not see how your argument
applies in other cases. I have recognised for some short time
that I have made a great omission in not having discussed, as
far as I could, the acquisition of taste, its inherited nature,
and its permanence within pretty close limits for long periods.
[With regard to the success of the  Descent of Man, I
quote from a letter to Professor Ray Lankester (March 22,
1871)2
 I think you will be glad to hear, as a proof of the in-
creasing liberality of England, that my book has sold wonder-
fully .... and as yet no abuse (though some, no doubt, will
come, strong enough), and only contempt even in the poor
old Athen<Bum."
CTTXTHR As to reviews that struck him he wrote to Mr. Wallace
(March 24, 1871) :
 There is a very striking second article on my book in the
Pall Mall. The articles in the Spectator * have also interested
me much."

CTTXTHR On March 20 he wrote to Mr. Murray :
 Many thanks for the Nonconformist [March 8, 1871]. I
like to see all that is written, and it is of some real use. If
you hear of reviewers in out-of-the-way papers, especially the
religious, as Record, Guardian, Tablet, kindly inform me. It
is wonderful that there has been no abuse * as yet, but I
suppose I shall not escape. On the whole, the reviews have
been highly favourable.
CTTXTHR The following extract from a letter to Mr. Murray (April
13, 1871) refers to a review in the Times .f
I have no idea who wrote the Times review. He has
no knowledge of science, and seems to me a wind-bag full
of metaphysics and classics, so that I do not much regard
his adverse judgment, though I suppose it will injure the
sale."
A review of the  Descent of Man, which my father spoke
of as  capital, appeared in the Saturday Review (Mar. 4
and 11, 1871). A passage from the first notice (Mar. 4) may
be quoted in illustration of the broad basis, as regards general
acceptance, on which the doctrine of Evolution now stood :
He claims to have brought man himself, his origin and
constitution, within that unity which he had previously
sought to trace through all lower animal forms. The growth
of opinion in the interval, due in chief measure to his own
intermediate works, has placed the discussion of this problem
  I feel a full conviction that
my chapter on man will excite
attention and plenty of abuse, and
1 suppose abuse is as good as
praise for selling a book. (From
a letter to Mr. Murray, Jan. 31,
1867.)
t Times, April 7 and 8, 1871.
The review is not only unfavourable
as regards the book under dis-
cussion, but also as regards Evolu-
tion in general, as the following
citation will show :  Even had it
been rendered highly probable,
which we doubt, that the animal
creation has been developed into
its numerous and widely different
varieties by mere evolution, it would
still require an independent investi-
gation of overwhelming force and
completeness to justify the pre-
sumption that man isbut a term in

in a position very much in advance of that held by it fifteen
years ago. The problem of Evolution is hardly any longer to
be treated as one of first principles ; nor has Mr. Darwin to
do battle for a first hearing of his central hypothesis, upborne
as it is by a phalanx of names full of distinction and promise,
in either hemisphere.
The infolded point of the human ear, discovered by
Mr. Woolner, and described in the  Descent of Man, seems
especially to have struck the popular imagination ; my father
wrote to Mr. Woolner :
 The tips to the ears have become quite celebrated. One
reviewer ( Nature ) says they ought to be called, as I sug-
gested in joke, Angulus Woolneriatius .* A German is very
proud to find that he has the tips well developed, and I
believe will send me a photograph of his ears.]
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to John Brodie Innes.\
Down, May 29 [1871].
My DEAR Innes,  I have been very glad to receive your
pleasant letter, for, to tell you the truth, I have sometimes
wondered whether you would not think me an outcast and
a reprobate after the publication of my last book [ Descent ]4
I do not wonder at all at your not agreeing with me, for a
good many professed naturalists do not. Yet when I see in
how extraordinary a manner the judgment of naturalists has
changed since I published the  Origin, I feel convinced that
there will be in ten years quite as much unanimity about man,
as far as his corporeal frame is concerned. . . .

Mr. Innes, he says  We often
differed, but you are one of those rare

and yet feel no shade of animosity,
and that is a thing which I should
feel very proud of, if any one could
say it of me.

[CTTXTHR The following letters, addressed to Dr. Ogle, deal with
the progress of the work on Expression.]
Down, March 12 [1871].
Mv DEAR Dr. Ogle,  I have received both your letters,
and they tell me all that I wanted to know in the clearest
possible way, as, indeed, all your letters have ever done.
I thank you cordially. I will give the case of the murderer *
in my hobby-horse essay on Expression. I fear that the
Eustachian tube question must have cost you a deal of
labour; it is quite a complete little essay. It is pretty
clear that the mouth is not opened under surprise merely to
improve the hearing. Yet why do deaf men generally keep
their mouths open ? The other day a man here was mimick-
ing a deaf friend, leaning his head forward and sideways to
the speaker, with his mouth well open ; it was a lifelike
representation of a deaf man. Shakespeare somewhere says :
' Hold your breath, listen  or  hark, I forget which. Sur-
prise hurries the breath, and it seems to me one can breathe,
at least hurriedly, much quieter through the open mouth
than through the nose. I saw the other day you doubted
this. As objection is your province at present, I think
breathing through the nose ought to come within it likewise,
so do pray consider this point, and let me hear your judg-
ment. Consider the nose to be a flower to be fertilised, and
then you will make out all about itf I have had to allude
to your paper on  Sense of Smell; J is the paging right,
namely, 1, 2, 3 ? If not, I protest by all the gods against the
plan followed by some, of having presentation copies falsely
paged ; and so does Rolleston, as he wrote to me the other
day. In haste.
Yours very sincerely,
C. Darwin.

Down, March 25 [1871].
My DEAR Dr. Ogle,  You will think me a horrid bore,
but I beg you, in relation to a new point for observation, to
imagine as well as you can that you suddenly come across
some dreadful object, and act with a sudden little start, a
shudder of horror ; please do this once or twice, and observe
yourself as well as you can, and afterwards read the rest of
this note, which I have consequently pinned down. I find, to
my surprise, whenever I act thus my platysma contracts. Does
yours ? (N.B.  See what a man will do for science ; I began
this note with a horrid fib, namely, that I want you to attend
to a new point.*) I will try and get some persons thus to act
who are so lucky as not to know that they even possess this
muscle, so troublesome for any one making out about expres-
sion. Is a shudder akin to the rigor or shivering before
fever? If so, perhaps the platysma could be observed in
such cases. Paget told me that he had attended much to
shivering, and had written in MS. on the subject, and been
much perplexed about it He mentioned that passing a
catheter often causes shivering. Perhaps I will write to him
about the platysma. He is always most kind in aiding me in
all ways, but he is so overworked that it hurts my conscience
to trouble him, for I have a conscience, little as you have
reason to think so. Help me if you can, and forgive me.
Your murderer case has come in splendidly as the acme
of prostration from fear.
Yours very sincerely,
C. Darwin.
* The point was doubtless de- being directed to the platysma, a
scribed as a new one, to avoid the muscle which had been the subject
possibility of Dr. Ogles attention of discussion in other letters.

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to Dr. Ogle.
Down, April 29 [1871].
My dear Dr. Ogle,  I am truly obliged for all the
great trouble which you have so kindly taken. I am sure
you have no cause to say that you are sorry you can give me
no definite information, for you have given me far more than
I ever expected to get. The action of the platysma is not
very important for me, but 1 believe that you will fully
understand (for I have always fancied that our minds were
very similar) the intolerable desire I had not to be utterly
baffled. Now I know that it sometimes contracts from fear
and from shuddering, but not apparently from a prolonged
state of fear such as the insane suffer. . . .
[Mr. Mivarts Genesis of Species,  a contribution to the
literature of Evolution, which excited much attention,  was

eventful life, supported by the small
stipend of his office, and by what
he earned from his occasional

He thought and read much on
metaphysical subjects, but on the
whole with an outcome (as far as
the world was concerned) not com-

theory by placing it in its proper relations to philosophical
inquiries in general. *
With regard to the proofs received from Mr. Wright, my
father wrote to Mr. Wallace :]
Down, July 9 [1871].
My dear Wallace,  I send by this post a review by
Chauncey Wright, as I much want your opinion of it as soon
as you can send it I consider you an incomparably better
critic than I am. The article, though not very clearly
written, and poor in parts from want of knowledge, seems
to me admirable. Mivarts book is producing a great effect
against Natural Selection, and more especially against me
Therefore if you think the article even somewhat good I will
write and get permission to publish it as a shilling pamphlet,
together with the MS. additions (enclosed), for which there
was not room at the end of the review. . . .
I am now at work at a new and cheap edition of the
Origin, and shall answer several points in Mivarts book,
and introduce a new chapter for this purpose ; but I treat the
subject so much more concretely, and I dare say less philo-
sophically, than Wright, that we shall not interfere with each
other. You will think me a bigot when I say, after studying
Mivart, I was never before in my life so convinced of the
general (t.e. not in detail) truth of the views in the ' Origin.'
I grieve to see the omission of the words by Mivart, detected
by Wright, t I complained to Mivart that in two cases he
quotes only the commencement of sentences by me, and thus

Down, July 14, 1871.
My DEAR Sir,  I have hardly ever in my life read an
article which has given me so much satisfaction as the
review which you have been so kind as to send me. I agree
to almost everything which you say. Your memory must be
wonderfully accurate, for you know my works as well as I do
myself, and your power of grasping other mens thoughts is
something quite surprising ; and this, as far as my experience
goes, is a very rare quality. As I read on I perceived how
you have acquired this power, viz. by thoroughly analyzing
each word.
. . . Now I am going to beg a favour. Will you pro-
visionally give me permission to reprint your article as a
shilling pamphlet ? I ask only provisionally, as I have not
yet had time to reflect on the subject. It would cost me,
I fancy, with advertisements, some �� 20 or ��30; but the
worst is that, as I hear, pamphlets never will sell. And this
makes me doubtful. Should you think it too much trouble
to send me a title for the chance t The title ought, I think,
to have Mr. Mivarts name on it.
... If you grant permission and send a title, you will
kindly understand that I will first make further enquiries
whether there is any chance of a pamphlet being read.
Pray believe me yours very sincerely obliged,

.... I feel very doubtful how far I shall succeed in
answering Mivart, it is so difficult to answer objections to
doubtful points, and make the discussion readable. I shall
make only a selection. The worst of it is, that I cannot
possibly hunt through all my references for isolated points, it
would take me three weeks of intolerably hard work. I wish
I had your power of arguing clearly. At present I feel sick
of everything, and if I could occupy my time and forget my
daily discomforts, or rather miseries, I would never publish
another word. But I shall cheer up, I dare say, soon, having
only just got over a bad attack. Farewell ; God knows why
I bother you about myself. I can say nothing more about
missing-links than what I have said. I should rely much on
pre-silurian times ; but then comes Sir W. Thomson like an
odious spectre. Farewell.
. . . There is a most cutting review of me in the Quarterly
I have only read a few pages. The skill and style make me
think of Mivart. I shall soon be viewed as the most despic-
able of men. This * Quarterly Review  tempts me to republish
Ch. Wright, even if not read by any one, just to show
some one will say a word against Mivart, and that his ( u
Mivarts) remarks ought not to be swallowed without some
reflection. . . . God knows whether my strength and spirit
will last out to write a chapter versus Mivart and others ; I
do so hate controversy and feel I shall do it so badly.

'QUARTERLY REVIEW.'
147
1871.]
[The above-mentioned  Quarterly  review was the subject of
an article by Mr. Huxley in the November number of the
'Contemporary Review. Here, also, are discussed Mr.Wallaces
Contribution to the Theory of Natural Selection, and the
second edition of Mr. Mivarts * Genesis of Species. What
follows is taken from Mr. Huxleys article. The  Quarterly
reviewer, though being to some extent an evolutionist, believes
that Man  differs more from an elephant or a gorilla, than do
these from the dust of the earth on which they tread. The
reviewer also declares that my father has  with needless op-
position, set at naught the first principles of both philosophy
and religion. Mr. Huxley passes from the * Quarterly  re-
viewers further statement, that there is no necessary opposi-
tion between evolution and religion, to the more definite
position taken by Mr. Mivart, that the orthodox authorities
of the Roman Catholic Church agree in distinctly asserting
derivative creation, so that  their teachings harmonize with
all that modern science can possibly require. Here Mr.
Huxley felt the want of that  study of Christian philo-
sophy (at any rate, in its Jesuitic garb), which Mr. Mivart
speaks of, and it was a want he at once set to work to fill up.
He was then staying at St. Andrews, whence he wrote to
my father :
By great good luck there is an excellent library here, with
a good copy of Suarez,* in a dozen big folios. Among these I
dived, to the great astonishment of the librarian, and looking
into them  as the careful robin eyes the delvers toil  ( vide
Idylls), I carried off the two venerable clasped volumes
which were most promising. Even those who know Mr.
Huxleys unrivalled power of tearing the heart out of a book
must marvel at the skill with which he has made Suarez
speak on his side.  So I have come out, he wrote,  in the
new character of a defender of Catholic orthodoxy, and upset
Mivart out of the mouth of his own prophet.
* The learned Jesuit on whom Mr. Mivart mainly relies.
H 8  DESCENT OF MAN EXPRESSION. [1871.
The remainder of Mr. Huxleys critique is largely occupied
with a dissection of the  Quarterly  reviewers psychology, and
his ethical views. He deals, too, with Mr. Wallaces objections
to the doctrine of Evolution by natural causes when applied
to the mental faculties of Man. Finally, he devotes a couple
of pages to justifying his description of the Quarterly
reviewers  treatment of Mr. Darwin as alike unjust and un-
becoming.
It will be seen that the two following letters were written
before the publication of Mr. Huxleys article.]
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to T. H. Huxley.
Down, September 31 [1871],
My DEAR Huxley, Your letter has pleased me in many
ways, to a wonderful degree. . . . What a wonderful man
you are to grapple with those old metaphysico-divinity books.
It quite delights me that you are going to some extent to
answer and attack Mivart. His book, as you say, has pro-
duced a great effect ; yesterday I perceived the reverberations
from it, even from Italy. It was this that made me ask
Chauncey Wright to publish at my expense his article, which
seems to me very clever, though ill-written. He has not
knowledge enough to grapple with Mivart in detail. I think
there can be no shadow of doubt that he is the author of the
article in the  Quarterly Review  . . . Iam preparing a new
edition of the ' Origin, and shall introduce a new chapter in
answer to miscellaneous objections, and shall give up the
greater part to answer Mivarts cases of difficulty of incipient
structures being of no use : and I find it can be done easily.
He never states his case fairly, and makes wonderful blunders.
. . . The pendulum is now swinging against our side, but I
feel positive it will soon swing the other way ; and no mortal
man will do half as much as you in giving it a start in the
right direction, as you did at the first commencement. God
forgive me for writing so long and egotistical a letter; but it

is your fault, for you have so delighted me ; I never dreamed
that you would have time to say a word in defence of the
cause which you have so often defended. It will be a long
battle, after we are dead and gone. . . . Great is the power
of misrepresentation. . . .
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to T. H. Huxley.
Down, September 30 [1871].
MY dear Huxley,  It was very good of you to send the
proof-sheets, for I was very anxious to read your article. I
have been delighted with it. How you do smash Mivarts
theology : it is almost equal to your article versus Comte,  *
that never can be transcended. . . . But I have been pre-
eminently glad to read your discussion on [the  Quarterly 1
reviewers] metaphysics, especially about reason and his de-
finition of it. I felt sure he was wrong, but having only
common observation and sense to trust to, I did not know
what to say in my second edition of my  Descent Now a
footnote and reference to you will do the work. . . . For me,
this is one of the most important parts of the review. But for
pleasure, I have been particularly glad that my few words t on
the distinction, if it can be so called, between Mivarts two
forms of morality, caught your attention. I am so pleased
that you take the same view, and give authorities for it ; but I
searched Mill in vain on this head. How well you argue the
whole case. I am mounting climax on climax ; for after all
there is nothing, I think, better in your whole review than your
 'Fortnightly Review, 1869.
With regard to the relations of
Positivism to Science, my father
wrote to Mr. Spencer in 1875 :

see to what an extent the Positivists
hate all men of science : 1 fancy
laughable and gigantic blunders
their prophet made in predicting
the course of science."

you what Hooker said to me a few years ago.  When I read
Huxley, I feel quite infantile in intellect. By Jove I have
felt the truth of this throughout your review. What a man
you are. There are scores of splendid passages, and vivid
flashes of wit. I have been a good deal more than merely
pleased by the concluding part of your review ; and all the
more, as I own I felt mortified by the accusation of bigotry,
arrogance, &c., in the * Quarterly Review. But I assure you,
he may write his worst, and he will never mortify me again.

Haredene, Albury, August 2 [1871].
My dear Sir,  Y our last letter has interested me greatly;
it is wonderfully rich in facts and original thoughts. First, let
me say that I have been much pleased by what you say
about my book. It has had a very large sale ; but I have
been much abused for it, especially for the chapter on the
moral sense ; and most of my reviewers consider the book as
a poor affair. God knows what its merits may really be ; all
that I know is that I did my best With familiarity I think
naturalists will accept sexual selection to a greater extent
than they now seem inclined to do. I should very much like
to publish your letter, but I do not see how it could be made
intelligible, without numerous coloured illustrations, but I will
consult Mr. Wallace on this head. I earnestly hope that you
keep notes of all your letters and that some day you will
publish a book :  Notes of a Naturalist in S. Brazil, or some
such title. Wallace will hardly admit the possibility of
sexual selection with Lepidoptera, and no doubt it is very
improbable. Therefore, I am very glad to hear of your cases

Hesperiadai, which display their wings differently, according to
which surface is coloured. I cannot believe that such display
is accidental and purposeless. . . .
No fact of your letter has interested me more than that
about mimicry. It is a capital fact about the males pursuing
the wrong females. You put the difficulty of the first steps in
imitation in a most striking and convincing manner. Your
idea of sexual selection having aided protective imitation
interests me greatly, for the same idea had occurred to me in
quite different cases, viz. the dulness of all animals in the
Galapagos Islands, Patagonia, &c., and in some other cases ;
but I was afraid even to hint at such an idea. Would you
object to my giving some such sentence as follows :  F
Muller suspects that sexual selection may have come into
play, in aid of protective imitation, in a very peculiar manner,
which will appear extremely improbable to those who do not
fully believe in sexual selection. It is that the appreciation
of certain colour is developed in those species which frequently
behold other species thus ornamented. Again let me thank
you cordially for your most interesting letter. . . .

pleasure of telling you how greatly I have been interested by
your  Primitive Culture, now that I have finished it It seems
to me a most profound work, which will be certain to have
permanent value, and to be referred to for years to come. It
is wonderful how you trace animism from the lower races up

a new point of view. How curious, also, are the survivals or

at my writing at so late a period, but I have had the book
read aloud to me, and from much ill-health of late, could only
stand occasional short reads. The undertaking must have
cost you gigantic labour. Nevertheless, I earnestly hope that
you may be induced to treat morals in the same enlarged yet
careful manner, as you have animism. I fancy from the last
chapter that you have thought of this. No man could do the
work so well as you, and the subject assuredly is a most
important and interesting one. You must now possess refer-

[At the beginning of the year the sixth edition of the
Origin, which had been begun in June 1871, was nearly
completed. The last sheet was revised on January 10, 1872,
and the book was published in the course of the month.
This volume differs from the previous ones in appearance
and size  it consists of 458 pp. instead of 596 pp., and is a
few ounces lighter ; it is printed on bad paper, in small type,
and with the lines unpleasantly close together. It had, how-
ever, one advantage over the previous editions, namely that
it was issued at a lower price. It is to be regretted that this
the final edition of the  Origin  should have appeared in
so unattractive a form ; a form which has doubtless kept many
readers from the book.
The discussion suggested by the  Genesis of Species  was
perhaps the most important addition to the book. The ob-
jection that incipient structures cannot be of use, was dealt
with in some detail, because it seemed to the author that this

was the point in Mr. Mivarts book which had struck most
readers in England.
It is a striking proof of how wide and general had become
the acceptance of his views, that my father found it necessary
to insert (sixth edition, p. 424), the sentence :  As a record
of a former state of things, I have retained in the foregoing
paragraphs and also elsewhere, several sentences which imply
that naturalists believe in the separate creation of each
species ; and I have been much censured for having thus
expressed myself. But undoubtedly this was the general
belief when the first edition of the present work appeared. . .
Now things are wholly changed, and almost every naturalist
admits the great principle of evolution."
A small correction introduced into this sixth edition is
connected with one of his minor papers :  Note on the habits
of the Pampas Woodpecker."  The paper in question was a
reply to Mr. Hudsons remarks on the woodpecker in a
previous number of the same journal. The last sentence of
my fathers paper is worth quoting for its temperate tone :
 Finally, I trust that Mr. Hudson is mistaken when he says
that any one acquainted with the habits of this bird might
be induced to believe that I had purposely wrested the
truth in order to prove my theory. He exonerates me
from this charge ; but I should be loath to think that there
are many naturalists who, without any evidence, would
accuse a fellow-worker of telling a deliberate falsehood to
prove his theory. In the fifth edition of the  Origin, p. 220,
he wrote :
 Yet as I can assert not only from my own observation, but
from that of the accurate Azara, it [the ground woodpecker]
never climbs a tree. In the sixth edition, p. 142, the passage
runs  in certain large districts it does not climb trees. And
he goes on to give Mr. Hudsons statement, that in other
regions it does frequent trees.

One of the additions in the sixth edition (p. 149), was a
reference to Mr. A. Hyatts and Professor Copes theory of
 acceleration. With regard to this he wrote (October 10,
1872) in characteristic words to Mr. Hyatt :
 Permit me to take this opportunity to express my sincere
regret at having committed two grave errors in the last
edition of my 1 Origin of Species, in my allusion to yours and
Professor Copes views on acceleration and retardation of de-
velopment I had thought that Professor Cope had preceded
you ; but I now well remember having formerly read with
lively interest, and marked, a paper by you somewhere in my
library, on fossil Cephalopods with remarks on the subject.
It seems also that I have quite misrepresented your joint
view. This has vexed me much. I confess that I have
never been able to grasp fully what you wish to show, and I
presume that this must be owing to some dulness on my
part.
The sixth edition of the Origin being intended as a
popular one, was made to include a glossary of technical
terms,  given because several readers have complained . . .
that some of the terms used were unintelligible to them.
The glossary was compiled by Mr. Dallas, and being an
excellent collection of clear and sufficient definitions, must
have proved useful to many readers.]

My DEAR Sir,  I have now read your essay t with very
great interest. Your view of the origin of local races
through Amixie, is altogether new to me, and seems to
throw an important light on an obscure problem. There is,
however, something strange about the periods or endurance
of variability. I formerly endeavoured to investigate the
subject, not by looking to past time, but to species of the
same genus widely distributed ; and I found in many cases
that all the species, with perhaps one or two exceptions, were
variable. It would be a very interesting subject for a con-

chologist to investigate, viz. : whether the species of the same
genus were variable during many successive geological forma-
tions. I began to make enquiries on this head, but failed in
this, as in so many other things, from the want of time and
strength. In your remarks on crossing, you do not, as it
seems to me, lay nearly stress enough on the increased vigour
of the offspring derived from parents which have been exposed
to different conditions. I have during the last five years
been making experiments on this subject with plants, and
have been astonished at the results, which have not yet been
published.
In the first part of your essay, I thought that you wasted
(to use an English expression) too much powder and shot on
M. Wagner;* but I changed my opinion when I saw how
admirably you treated the whole case, and how well you
used the facts about the Planorbis. I wish I had studied
this latter case more carefully. The manner in which, as
you show, the different varieties blend together and make
a constant whole, agrees perfectly with my hypothetical
illustrations.
Many years ago the late E. Forbes described three closely
consecutive beds in a secondary formation, each with repre-
sentative forms of the same fresh-water shells : the case is
evidently analogous with that of Hilgendorf.t but the interest-
ing connecting varieties or links were here absent I rejoice
to think that I formerly said as emphatically as I could, that
neither isolation nor time by themselves do anything for the
modification of species. Hardly anything in your essay has
pleased me so much personally, as to find that you believe to
a certain extent in sexual selection. As far as I can judge,

very few naturalists believe in this. I may have erred on
many points, and extended the doctrine too far, but I feel a
strong conviction that sexual selection will hereafter be
admitted to be a powerful agency. I cannot agree with what
you say about the taste for beauty in animals not easily vary-
ing. It may be suspected that even the habit of viewing
differently coloured surrounding objects would influence their
taste, and Fritz Miiller even goes so far as to believe that the
sight of gaudy butterflies might influence the taste of distinct
species. There are many remarks and statements in your
essay which have interested me greatly, and I thank you for
the pleasure which I have received from reading it.
With sincere respect, I remain,
My dear Sir, yours very faithfully,
Charles Darwin.
P.S.  If you should ever be induced to consider the whole
doctrine of sexual selection, I think that you will be led to
the conclusion, that characters thus gained by one sex are
very commonly transferred in a greater or less degree to the
other sex.
[CTTXTHR With regard to Moritz Wagners first Essay, my father
wrote to that naturalist, apparently in 1868 :]
Dear and respected Sir, I thank you sincerely for
sending me your  Migrationsgesetz, 8tc., and for the very
kind and most honourable notice which you have taken of my
works. That a naturalist who has travelled into so many and
such distant regions, and who has studied animals of so many
classes, should, to a considerable extent, agree with me, is, I
can assure you, the highest gratification of which I am
capable. . . . Although I saw the effects of isolation in the
case of islands and mountain-ranges, and knew of a few
instances of rivers, yet the greater number of your facts were
quite unknown to me. I now see that from the want of

knowledge I did not make nearly sufficient use of the views
which you advocate ; and I almost wish I could believe in its
importance to the same extent with you ; for you well show,
in a manner which never occurred to me, that it removes
many difficulties and objections. But I must still believe that
in many large areas all the individuals of the same species
have been slowly modified, in the same manner, for instance,
as the English race-horse has been improved, that is by the
continued selection of the fleetest individuals, without any
separation. But I admit that by this process two or more
new species could hardly be found within the same limited
area ; some degree of separation, if not indispensable, would
be highly advantageous ; and here your facts and views will
be of great value. . . .

Down, October 13, 1876.
Dear Sir,  I have now finished reading your essays,
which have interested me in a very high degree, notwith-
standing that I differ much from you on various points. For
instance, several considerations make me doubt whether
species are much more variable at one period than at another,
except through the agency of changed conditions. I wish,
however, that I could believe in this doctrine, as it removes
many difficulties. But my strongest objection to your theory
is that it does not explain the manifold adaptations in struc-
ture in every organic being  for instance in a Picus for
climbing trees and catching insects  or in a Strix for catching
animals at night, and so on ad infinitum. No theory is in
the least satisfactory to me unless it clearly explains such

adaptations. I think that you misunderstand my views on
isolation. I believe that all the individuals of a species can
be slowly modified within the same district, in nearly the
same manner as man effects by what I have called the
process of unconscious selection. ... I do not believe that
one species will give birth to two or more new species, as
long as they are mingled together within the same district
Nevertheless I cannot doubt that many new species have
been simultaneously developed within the same large conti-
nental area ; and in my * Origin of Species  I endeavoured
to explain how two new species might be developed,
although they met and intermingled on the borders of their
range. It would have been a strange fact if I had over-
looked the importance of isolation, seeing that it was such
cases as that of the Galapagos Archipelago, which chiefly
led me to study the origin of species. In my opinion the
greatest error which I have committed, has been not allowing
sufficient weight to the direct action of the environment,
U. food, climate, &c., independently of natural selection.
Modifications thus caused, which are neither of advantage nor
disadvantage to the modified organism, would be especially
favoured, as I can now see chiefly through your observations,
by isolation in a small area, where only a few individuals
lived under nearly uniform conditions.
When I wrote the * Origin, and for some years afterwards,
I could find little good evidence of the direct action of the
environment ; now there is a large body of evidence, and your
case of the Satumia is one of the most remarkable of which I
have heard. Although we differ so greatly, I hope that you
will permit me to express my respect for your long-continued
and successful labours in the good cause of natural science.

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to K. Semper.
Down, November 26, 1878.
My dear Professor Semper,  When I published the
sixth edition of the  Origin, I thought a good deal on the
subject to which you refer, and the opinion therein expressed
was my deliberate conviction. I went as far as I could,
perhaps too far, in agreement with Wagner ; since that time I
have seen no reason to change my mind, but then I must add
that my attention has been absorbed on other subjects.
There are two different classes of cases, as it appears to me,
viz. those in which a species becomes slowly modified in the
same country (of which I cannot doubt there are innumerable
instances) and those cases in which a species splits into two
or three or more new species ; and in the latter case, I should
think nearly perfect separation would greatly aid in their
 specification, to coin a new word.
I am very glad that you are taking up this subject, for you
will be sure to throw much light on it 1 remember well,
long ago, oscillating much ; when I thought of the Fauna and
Flora of the Galapagos Islands I was all for isolation, when I
thought of S. America I doubted much. Pray believe me,

Dear Professor Semper,  Since writing I have recalled
some of the thoughts and conclusions which have passed

through ray mind of late years. In North America, in going
from north to south or from east to west, it is clear that the
changed conditions of life have modified the organisms in the
different regions, so that they now form distinct races or even
species. It is further clear that in isolated districts, however
small, the inhabitants almost always get slightly modified, and
how far this is due to the nature of the slightly different
conditions to which they are exposed, and how far to mere
interbreeding, in the manner explained by Weismann, I can
form no opinion. The same difficulty occurred to me (as
shown in my Variation of Animals and Plants under Domesti-
cation ') with respect to the aboriginal breeds of cattle, sheep,
&c., in the separated districts of Great Britain, and indeed
throughout Europe. As our knowledge advances, very slight
differences, considered by systematists as of no importance
in structure, are continually found to be functionally im-
portant ; and I have been especially struck with this fact in
the case of plants to which my observations have of late years
been confined. Therefore it seems to me rather rash to
consider the slight differences between representative species,
for instance those inhabiting the different islands of the same
archipelago, as of no functional importance, and as not in any
way due to natural selection. With respect to all adopted
structures, and these are innumerable, I cannot see how M.
Wagner's view throws any light, nor indeed do I see at all
more clearly than I did before, from the numerous cases
which he has brought forward, how and why it is that a long
isolated form should almost always become slightly modified.
I do not know whether you will care about hearing my
further opinion on the point in question, for as before
remarked I have not attended much of late years to such
questions, thinking it prudent, now that I am growing old, to
work at easier subjects.
Believe me, yours very sincerely,
C. Darwin.

I hope and trust that you will throw light on these points.
P.S.  I will add another remark which I remember
occurred to me when I first read M. Wagner. When a
species first arrives on a small island, it will probably increase
rapidly, and unless all the individuals change instantaneously
(which is improbable in the highest degree), the slowly, more
or less, modifying offspring must intercross one with another,
and with their unmodified parents, and any offspring not as
yet modified. The case will then be like that of domesticated
animals which have slowly become modified, either by the
action of the external conditions or by the process which I
have called the unconscious selection by man  i.e., in contrast
with methodical selection.

Dear Sir,  I thank you very sincerely and feel much
honoured by the trouble which you have taken in giving
me your reflections on the origin of Man. It gratifies me
extremely that some parts of my work have interested you,
and that we agree on the main conclusion of the derivation of
man from some lower form.
I will reflect on what you have said, but I cannot at present
give up my belief in the close relationship of Man to the
higher Simise. I do not put much trust in any single cha-
racter, even that of dentition ; but I put the greatest faith in
resemblances in many parts of the whole organisation, for I
cannot believe that such resemblances can be due to any
cause except close blood relationship. That man is closely
allied to the higher Simiae is shown by the classification of

Linnaeus, who was so good a judge of affinity. The man
who in England knows most about the structure of the
Simiae, namely, Mr. Mivart, and who is bitterly opposed
to my doctrines about the derivation of the mental powers,
yet has publicly admitted that I have not put man too
close to the higher Simiae, as far as bodily structure is
concerned. I do not think the absence of reversions of
structure in man is of much weight ; C. Vogt, indeed, argues
that [the existence of] Micro-cephalous idiots is a case of
reversion. No one who believes in Evolution will doubt that
the Phocae are descended from some terrestrial Carnivore.
Yet no one would expect to meet with any such reversion
in them. The lesser divergence of character in the races of
man in comparison with the species of Simiadae may perhaps
be accounted for by man having spread over the world at a
much later period than did the Simiadae. I am fully
prepared to admit the high antiquity of man ; but then we
have evidence, in the Dryopithecus, of the high antiquity of
the Anthropomorphous Simiae.
I am glad to hear that you are at work on your fossil
plants, which of late years have afforded so rich a field for
discovery. With my best thanks for your great kindness,

North American Review, which I have read with great
interest Nothing can be clearer than the way in which you
discuss the permanence or fixity of species. It never occurred
to me to suppose that any one looked at the case as it seems
Mr. Mivart does. Had I read his answer to you, perhaps I
should have perceived this ; but I have resolved to waste no
more time in reading reviews of my works or on Evolution,
excepting when I hear that they are good and contain new
matter. ... It is pretty clear that Mr. Mivart has come to
the end of his tether on this subject
As your mind is so clear, and as you consider so carefully
the meaning of words, I wish you would take some incidental
occasion to consider when a thing may properly be said to be
effected by the will of man. I have been led to the wish by
reading an article by your Professor Whitney versus Schleicher.
He argues, because each step of change in language is made
by the will of man, the whole language so changes ; but I do
not think that this is so, as man has no intention or wish to
change the language. It is a parallel case with what I haw
called  unconscious selection, which depends on men con-
sciously preserving the best individuals, and thus uncon-
sciously altering the breed.

Down, August 28, 1871
My DEAR WALLACE,  I have at last finished the gigantic
job of reading Dr. Bastians book,* and have been deeply
interested by it You wished to hear my impression, but it
is not worth sending.
He seems to me an extremely able man, as, indeed, I
thought when I read his first essay. His general argument
in favour of Archebiosis f is wonderfully strong, though I
cannot think much of some few of his arguments. The result
is that I am bewildered and astonished by his statements, but
am not convinced, though, on the whole, it seems to me pro-
bable that Archebiosis is true. I am not convinced, partly
I think owing to the deductive cast of much of his reasoning ;
and I know not why, but I never feel convinced by deduction,
even in the case of H. Spencers writings. If Dr. Bastians
book had been turned upside down, and he had begun with
the various cases of Heterogenesis, and then gone on to
organic, and afterwards to saline solutions, and had then given
his general arguments, I should have been, I believe, much
more influenced. I suspect, however, that my chief difficulty
is the effect of old convictions being stereotyped on my brain.
I must have more evidence that germs, or the minutest frag-
ments of the lowest forms, are always killed by 212 of Fahr.
Perhaps the mere reiteration of the statements given by
Dr. Bastian [of] other men, whose judgment I respect, and who
have worked long on the lower organisms, would suffice to
convince me. Here is a fine confession of intellectual weak-
ness ; but what an inexplicable frame of mind is that of
belief 1

ated, my mind can no more digest such statements, whether
true or false, than my stomach can digest a lump of lead.
Dr. Bastian is always comparing Archebiosis, as well as
growth, to crystallisation ; but, on this view, a Rotifer or Tardi-
grade is adapted to its humble conditions of life by a happy
accident, and this I cannot believe. . . . He must have
worked with very impure materials in some cases, as plenty
of organisms appeared in a saline solution not containing an
atom of nitrogen.
I wholly disagree with Dr. Bastian about many points in
his latter chapters. Thus the frequency of generalised forms
in the older strata seems to me clearly to indicate the common
descent with divergence of more recent forms. Notwith-
standing all his sneers, I do not strike my colours as yet about
Fangenesis. I should like to live to see Archebiosis proved
true, for it would be a discovery of transcendent importance ;
or, if false, I should like to see it disproved, and the facts
otherwise explained ; but I shall not live to see all this. If
ever proved, Dr. Bastian will have taken a prominent part in
the work. How grand is the onward rush of science; it is
enough to console us for the many errors which we have com-
mitted, and for our efforts being overlaid and forgotten in the
mass of new facts and new views which are daily turning up.
This is all I have to say about Dr. Bastians book, and it
certainly has not been worth saying. . . .

My DEAR Sir  I began reading your new book * sooner
than I intended, and when I once began, I could not stop ;
and now you must allow me to thank you for the very great
pleasure which it has given me. I have hardly ever read

anything more original and interesting than your treatment
of the causes which favour the development of scientific men.
The whole was quite new to me, and most curious. When
I began your essay I was afraid that you were going to attack
the principle of inheritance in relation to mind, but I soon
found myself fully content to follow you and accept your
limitations. I have felt, of course, special interest in the
latter part of your work, but there was here less novelty to
me. In many parts you do me much honour, and every-
where more than justice. Authors generally like to hear what
points most strike different readers, so I will mention that of
your shorter essays, that on the future prevalence of lan-
guages, and on vaccination interested me the most, as, indeed,
did that on statistics, and free will. Great liability to certain
diseases, being probably liable to atavism, is quite a new idea
to me. At p. 322 you suggest that a young swallow ought to
be separated, and then let loose in order to test the power
of instinct ; but nature annually performs this experiment,
as old cuckoos migrate in England some weeks before the
young birds of the same year. By the way, I have just used
the forbidden word nature," which, after reading your
essay, I almost determined never to use again. There
are very few remarks in your book to which I demur, but
when you back up Asa Gray in saying that all instincts are
congenital habits, I must protest.
Finally, will you permit me to ask you a question : have
you yourself, or [has] some one who can be quite trusted,
observed (p. 322) that the butterflies on the Alps are tamer
than those on the lowlands ? Do they belong to the same
species? Has this fact been observed with more than one
species ? Are they brightly coloured kinds ? I am especially
curious about their alighting on the brightly coloured parts
of ladies dresses, more especially because I have been more
than once assured that butterflies like bright colours, for
instance, in India the scarlet leaves of Fointsettia.

have received in reading it

[The last revise of the  Expression of the Emotions  was
finished on August 22nd, 1872, and he wrote in his Diary :
* Has taken me about twelve months. As usual he had no
belief in the possibility of the book being generally successful.
The following passage in a letter to Haeckel serves to show
that he had felt the writing of this book as a somewhat
severe strain :
" I have finished my little book on  Expression, and when
it is published in November I will of course send you a copy,
in case you would like to read it for amusement. I have
resumed some old botanical work, and perhaps I shall never
again attempt to discuss theoretical views.
 I am growing old and weak, and no man can tell when
his intellectual powers begin to fail Long life and happiness
to you for your own sake and for that of science.
It was published in the autumn. The edition consisted of
7000, and of these 5267 copies were sold at Mr. Murrays sale
in November. Two thousand were printed at the end of the
year, and this proved a misfortune, as they did not afterwards
sell so rapidly, and thus a mass of notes collected by the
author was never employed for a second edition during his
lifetime.
Among the reviews of the * Expression of the Emotions
may be mentioned the not unfavourable notices in the At/ie-
lueum, Nov. 9, 1872, and the Times, Dec. 13, 1872. A good
review by Mr. Wallace appeared in the  Quarterly Journal
of Science, Jan. 1873. Mr. Wallace truly remarks that the
book exhibits certain  characteristics of the author's mind in

an eminent degree, namely,  the insatiable longing to dis-
cover the causes of the varied and complex phenomena pre-
sented by living things. He adds that in the case of the
author the restless curiosity of the child to know the what
for? the why? and the how? of everything seems
never to have abated its force.
A writer in one of the theological reviews describes the
book as  the most powerful and insidious  of all the authors
works.
Professor Alexander Bain criticised the book in a post-
script to the  Senses and the Intellect ;  to this essay the
following letter refers :]

My DEAR SIR,  I am particularly obliged to you for having
sent me your essay. Your criticisms are all written in a
quite fair spirit, and indeed no one who knows you or your
works would expect anything else. What you say about the
vagueness of what I have called the direct action of the
nervous system, is perfectly just I felt it so at the time, and
even more of late. I confess that I have never been able
fully to grasp your principle of spontaneity,* as well as some
other of your points, so as to apply them to special cases,
* Professor Bain expounded his
theory of Spontaneity in the essay
here alluded to. It would be im-
possible to do justice to it within
the limits of a foot-note. The
following quotations may give some
notion of it :
 By Spontaneity I understand the
readiness to pass into movement,
in the absence of all stimulation
whatever; the essential requisite
being that the nerve-centres and
muscles shall be fresh and vigorous

But as we look at everything from different points of view, it
is not likely that we should agree closely.
I have been greatly pleased by what you say about the
crying expression and about blushing. Did you read a review
in a late  Edinburgh  ? * It was magnificently contemptuous
towards myself and many others.

* The review on the  Expression
of the Emotions  appeared in the
April number of the  Edinburgh
Review, 1873. The opening sen-
tence is'a fair sample of the general
tone of the article :  Mr. Darwin has
added another volume of amusing
stories and grotesque illustrations
already devoted to the exposition
and defence of the evolutionary
hypothesis. A few other quota-
tions may be worth giving.  His
one-sided devotion to an i priori
scheme of interpretation seems thus
steadily tending to impair the
authors hitherto unrivalled powers
as an observer. However this may
be, most impartial critics will, we
think, admit that there is a marked
falling off, both in philosophical
tone and scientific interest, in the
works produced since Mr. Darwin
committed himself to the crude
metaphysical conception so largely
associated with his name. The
article is directed against Evolution
as a whole, almost as much as
against the doctrines of the book
under discussion. We find through-
out plenty of that effective style of
criticism which consists in the use
of such expressions as dogma-
tism,  intolerance,  presump-
tuous,  arrogant ;  together with
accusations of such various faults
as virtual abandonment of the
inductive method, and the use of
slang and vulgarisms.
The part of the article which
seems to have interested my father
is the discussion on the use which
he ought to have made of painting

the Emotions in Man and Animals and it has occurred to
me that you might possibly like to read some parts of it ; and
I can hardly think that this would have been the case with
any of the books which I have already published. So I send
by this post my present book. Although I have had no
communication with you or the other members of your family
for so long a time, no scenes in my whole life pass so
frequently or so vividly before my mind as those which relate
to happy old days spent at Woodhouse. I should very much
like to hear a little news about yourself and the other
members of your family, if you will take the trouble to write
to me. Formerly I used to glean some news about you from
my sisters.
I have had many years of bad health and have not been
able to visit anywhere ; and now I feel very old. As long as
I pass a perfectly uniform life, I am able to do some daily
work in Natural History, which is still my passion, as it was
in old days, when you used to laugh at me for collecting
beetles with such zeal at Woodhouse. Excepting from my
continued ill-health, which has excluded me from society, my
life has been a very happy one ; the greatest drawback being
that several of my children have inherited from me feeble
health. I hope with all my heart that you retain, at least to
a large extent, the famous  Owen constitution. With
sincere feelings of gratitude and affection for all bearing the

of me for so many years. Yet I ought to have felt assured
that you would remain as warm-hearted and as true-hearted
as you have ever been from my earliest recollection. I know
well how many grievous sorrows you have gone through ; but
I am very sorry to hear that your health is not good In the
spring or summer, when the weather is better, if you can
summon up courage to pay us a visit here, both my wife, as

dull here. It would be a real pleasure to me to see you.
Thank you much for telling about your family,  much of

preparation of a second edition of the  Descent of Man, the
publication of which is referred to in the following chapter.

My DEAR Sir,  M y wife has just finished reading aloud
your  Life with a Black Regiment, and you must allow me to
thank you heartily for the very great pleasure which it has in
many ways given us. I always thought well of the negroes,
from the little which I have seen of them ; and I have been
delighted to have my vague impressions confirmed, and their
character and mental powers so ably discussed. When you
were here I did not know of the noble position which you had
filled. I had formerly read about the black regiments, but
failed to connect your name with your admirable undertaking.
Although we enjoyed greatly your visit to Down, my wife
and myself have over and over again regretted that we did
not know about the black regiment, as we should have greatly
liked to have heard a little about the South from your own lips.
Your descriptions have vividly recalled walks taken forty
years ago in Brazil. We have your collected Essays, which
were kindly sent us by Mr. [Moncure] Conway, but have not
yet had time to read them. I occasionally glean a little news
of you in the  Index  ; and within the last hour have read an
interesting article of yours on the progress of Free Thought.

My DEAR HACKEL,  I thank you for the present of your
book , and I am heartily glad to see its great success. You
will do a wonderful amount of good in spreading the doctrine
of Evolution, supporting it as you do by so many original
observations. I have read the new preface with very great
interest. The delay in the appearance of the English trans-
lation vexes and surprises me, for I have never been able to
read it thoroughly in [German, and I shall assuredly do so
when it appears in English. Has the problem of the later
stages of reduction of useless structures ever perplexed you ?
This problem has of late caused me much perplexity. I have
just written a letter to  Nature  with a hypothetical explana-
tion of this difficulty, and I will send you the paper with the
passage marked. I will at the same time send a paper which
has interested me ; it need not be returned. It contains a
singular statement bearing on so-called Spontaneous Gener-
ation. I much wish that this latter question could be settled,
but I see no prospect of it. If it could be proved true this
would be most important to us. . . .
Wishing you every success in your admirable labours,
I remain, my dear Hackel, yours very sincerely,

1874 AND 1875.
[The year 1874 was given up to  Insectivorous Plants, with
the exception of the months devoted to the second edition of
the Descent of Man, (see Vol. III. p. 175) and with the further
exception of the time given to a second edition of his  Coral
Reefs  (1874). The Preface to the latter states that new facts
have been added, the whole book revised, and the latter
chapters almost rewritten." In the Appendix some account
is given of Professor SempePs objections, and this was the
occasion of correspondence between that naturalist and my
father. In Professor Sempeds volume,  Animal Life  (one of
the International Series), the author calls attention to the
subject in the following passage which I give in German, the
published English translation being, as it seems to me,
incorrect :  Es scheint mir als ob er in der zweiten Ausgabe
seines allgemein bekannten Werks iiber Korallenriffe einem
Irrthume liber meine Beobachtungen zum Opfer gefallen ist,
indem er die Angaben, die ich allerdings bisher immer nur
sehr kurz gehalten hatte, vollstandig falsch wiedergegeben
hat.
The proof-sheets containing this passage were sent by Pro-
fessor Semper to my father before  Animal Life  was published,
and this was the occasion for the following letter, which was
afterwards published in Professor Sempers book.]

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to K. Semper.
Down, October 2, 1875.
My dear Professor Semper, I thank you for your
extremely kind letter of the 19th, and for the proof-sheets. I
believe that I understand all, excepting one or two sentences,
where my imperfect knowledge of German has interfered.
This is my sole and poor excuse for the mistake which 1
made in the second edition of my Coral book. Your
account of the Pellew Islands is a fine addition to our know-
ledge on coral reefs. I have very little to say on the subject,
even if I had formerly read your account and seen your maps,
but had known nothing of the proofs of recent elevation,
and of your belief that the islands have not since subsided. I
have no doubt that I should have considered them as formed
during subsidence. But I should have been much troubled
in my mind by the sea not being so deep as it usually is
round atolls, and by the reef on one side sloping so gradually
beneath the sea ; for this latter fact, as far as my memory
serves me, is a very unusual and almost unparalleled case. I
always foresaw that a bank at the proper depth beneath the
surface would give rise to a reef which could not be distin-
guished from an atoll, formed during subsidence. I must
still adhere to my opinion, that the atolls and barrier reefs in
the middle of the Pacific and Indian Oceans indicate subsi-
dence ; but I fully agree with you that such cases as that of
the Pellew Islands, if of at all frequent occurrence, would
make my general conclusions of very little value. Future
observers must decide between us. It will be a strange fact
if there has not been subsidence of the beds of the great
oceans, and if this has not affected the forms of the coral
reefs.
In the last three pages of the last sheet sent I am extremely
glad to see that you are going to treat of the dispersion of
animals. Your preliminary remarks seem to me quite ex-

cellent. There is nothing about M. Wagner, as I expected
to find. I suppose that you have seen Moseleys last book,
which contains some good observations on dispersion.
I am glad that your book will appear in English, for then I
can read it with ease. Pray believe me,
Yours very sincerely,
Charles Darwin.
[The most recent criticism on the Coral-reef theory is by
Mr. Murray, one of the staff of the Challenger , who read a
paper before the Royal Society of Edinburgh, April 5, 1880.*
The chief point brought forward is the possibility of the
building up of submarine mountains, which may serve as
foundations for coral reefs. Mr. Murray also seeks to prove
that the chief features of coral reefs and islands can be
accounted for without calling in the aid of great and general
subsidence. The following letter refers to this subject :]
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to A. Agassis.
Down, May 5, 1881.
. . . You will have seen Mr. Murrays views on the forma-
tion of atolls and barrier reefs. Before publishing my book, I
thought long over the same view, but only as far as ordinary
marine organisms are concerned, for at that time little was
known of the multitude of minute oceanic organisms. I
rejected this view, as from the few dredgings made in the
Beagle, in the south temperate regions, I concluded that shells,
the smaller corals, &c., decayed, and were dissolved, when not
protected by the deposition of sediment, and sediment could
not accumulate in the open ocean. Certainly, shells, &c.,
were in several cases completely rotten, and crumbled into
mud between my fingers ; but you will know well whether

[I87+
this is in any degree common. I have expressly said that a
bank at the proper depth would give rise to an atoll, which
could not be distinguished from one formed during subsidence.
I can, however, hardly believe in the former presence of as
many banks (there having been no subsidence) as there are
atolls in the great oceans, within a reasonable depth, on which
minute oceanic organisms could have accumulated to the thick-
ness of many hundred feet. . . . Pray forgive me for troubling
you at such length, but it has occurred [to me] that you
might be disposed to give, after your wide experience, your
judgment. If I am wrong, the sooner I am knocked on the
head and annihilated so much the better. It still seems to
me a marvellous thing that there should not have been much,
and long continued, subsidence in the beds of the great
oceans. I wish that some doubly rich millionaire would take
it into his head to have borings made in some of the Pacific
and Indian atolls, and bring home cores for slicing from a
depth of 500 or 600 feet. . . .
[The second edition of the  Descent of Man  was published
in the autumn of 1874 Some severe remarks on the
monistic hypothesis" appeared in the July* number of
the  Quarterly Review 1 (p. 45). The reviewer expresses his
astonishment at the ignorance of certain elementary dis-
tinctions and principles (eg. with regard to the verbum
mentale) exhibited, among others, by Mr. Darwin, who docs
not exhibit the faintest indication of having grasped them,
yet a clear perception of them, and a direct and detailed
examination of his facts with regard to them, was a sine qui
non for attempting, with a chance of success, the solution of
the mystery as to the descent of man.
Some further criticisms of a later date may be here alluded
to. In the Academy, 1876 (pp. 562, 587), appeared a review
of Mr. Mivarts Lessons from Nature, by Mr. Wallace.
* The review necessarily deals with the first edition of the  Descent
of Man.
MR. MIVART.
1*74-]
185
When considering the part of Mr. Mivarts book relating to
Natural and Sexual Selection, Mr. Wallace says: In his
violent attack on Mr. Darwins theories our author uses
unusually strong language. Not content with mere argu-
ment, he expresses  reprobation of Mr. Darwins views  ; and
asserts that though he (Mr. Darwin) has been obliged,
virtually, to give up his theory, it is still maintained by
Darwinians with  unscrupulous audacity, and the actual
repudiation of it concealed by the  conspiracy of silence.
Mr. Wallace goes on to show that these charges are without
foundation, and points out that,  If there is one thing more
than another for which Mr. Darwin is pre-eminent among
modern literary and scientific men, it is for his perfect literary
honesty, his self-abnegation in confessing himself wrong, and
the eager haste with which he proclaims and even magnifies
small errors in his works, for the most part discovered by
himself.
CTTXTHR The following extract from a letter to Mr. Wallace (June
17th) refers to Mr. Mivarts statement (Lessons from Nature,
p. 144) that Mr. Darwin at first studiously disguised his views
as to the  bestiality of man  :
" I have only just heard of and procured your two articles
in the Academy. I thank you most cordially for your
generous defence of me against Mr. Mivart. In the  Origin
I did not discuss the derivation of any one species ; but that
I might not be accused of concealing my opinion, I went out
of my way, and inserted a sentence which seemed to me (and
still so seems) to disclose plainly my belief. This was quoted
in my  Descent of Man. Therefore it is very unjust ... of
Mr. Mivart to accuse me of base fraudulent concealment

My dear Mr. Gurney,  I have read your article t with
much interest, except the latter part, which soared above my
ken. I am greatly pleased that you uphold my views to a
certain extent Your criticism of the rasping noise made by
insects being necessarily rhythmical is very good ; but though
not made intentionally, it may be pleasing to the females,
from the nerve cells being nearly similar in function through-
out the animal kingdom. With respect to your letter, I
believe that I understand your meaning, and agree with you.
I never supposed that the different degrees and kinds of
pleasure derived from different music could be explained by
the musical powers of our semi-human progenitors. Docs
not the fact that different people belonging to the same
civilized nation are very differently affected by the same
music, almost show that these diversities of taste and pleasure
have been acquired during their individual lives? Your
simile of architecture seems to me particularly good ; for in
this case the appreciation almost must be individual, though
possibly the sense of sublimity excited by a grand cathedral
may have some connection with the vague feelings of terror
and superstition in our savage ancestors, when they entered
a great cavern or gloomy forest. I wish some one could
analyse the feeling of sublimity. It amuses me to think how
horrified some high-flying aesthetic men will be, at your
encouraging such low degraded views as mine.
Believe me, yours very sincerely,

manner that astounded every one, and took away all their

[In the spring of this year (1874) he read a book which
gave him great pleasure and of which he often spoke with
admiration :  The  Naturalist in Nicaragua, by the late
Thomas Belt Mr. Belt, whose untimely death may well be
deplored by naturalists, was by profession an Engineer, so
that all his admirable observations in natural history, in
Nicaragua and elsewhere, were the fruit of his leisure. The
book is direct and vivid in style and is full of description and
suggestive discussions. With reference to it my father
wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker :
 Belt I have read, and I am delighted that you like it so
much; it appears to me the best of all natural history
journals which have ever been published.]

Dear Sir,  I have been very neglectful in not having
sooner thanked you for your kindness in having sent me your
* fitudes sur la Vdgdtation, &c., and other memoirs. I have
read several of them with very great interest, and nothing can
be more important, in my opinion, than your evidence of the
extremely slow and gradual manner in which specific forms
change. I observe that M. A. De Candolle has lately quoted
you on this head versus Heer. I hope that you may be able
to throw light on the question whether such protean, or poly-
morphic forms, as those of Rubus, Hieracium, &c., at the
present day, are those which generate new species ; as for

My dear Gray,  I have now read your article  in
Nature, and the last two paragraphs were not included in
the slip sent before. I wrote yesterday and cannot remember
exactly what I said, and now cannot be easy without again
telling you how profoundly I have been gratified. Every one,
I suppose, occasionally thinks that he has worked in vain, and
when one of these fits overtakes me, I will think of your
article, and if that does not dispel the evil spirit, I shall know
that I am at the time a little bit insane, as we all are
occasionally.
What you say about Teleologyt pleases me especially, and I
do not think any one else $ has ever noticed the point. I have
always said you were the man to hit the nail on the head.
Yours gratefully and affectionately,
C. Darwin.

your outing. In your last letter you spoke of Mr. Judd's paper
on the Volcanoes of the Hebrides. I have just finished it,
and to ease my mind must express my extreme admiration.
It is years since I have read a purely geological paper
which has interested me so greatly. I was all the more
interested, as in the Cordillera I often speculated on the
sources of the deluges of submarine porphyritic lavas, of
which they are built ; and, as I have stated, I saw to a
certain extent the causes of the obliteration of the points of
eruption. I was also not a little pleased to see my volcanic
book quoted, for I thought it was completely dead and
forgotten. What fine work will Mr. Judd assuredly do! ....
Now I have eased my mind ; and so farewell, with both
E. D.s and C. D.s very kind remembrances to Miss Lyell.

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to Aug. For el.
Down, October 15, 1874.
My DEAR Sir,  I have now read the whole of your admir-
able work* and seldom in my life have I been more in-
terested by any book. There are so many interesting facts
and discussions, that I hardly know which to specify ; but I
think, firstly, the newest points to me have been about the
size of the brain in the three sexes, together with your sugges-
tion that increase of mind-power may have led to the sterility
of the workers. Secondly about the battles of the ants, and
your curious account of the enraged ants being held by their
comrades until they calmed down. Thirdly, the evidence of
ants of the same community being the offspring of brothers
and sisters. You admit, I think, that new communities will
often be the product of a cross between not-related ants.
Fritz Muller has made some interesting observations on this
head with respect to Termites. The case of Anergates is
most perplexing in many ways, but I have such faith in the
law of occasional crossing that I believe an explanation will
hereafter be found, such as the dimorphism of either sex and
the occasional production of winged males. I see that you
are puzzled how ants of the same community recognize each
other; I once placed two (F. rufa) in a pill-box smelling
strongly of asafoetida and after a day returned them to their
homes ; they were threatened, but at last recognized. I
made the trial thinking that they might know each other by

their odour ; but this cannot have been the case, and I have
often fancied that they must have some common signal.
Your last chapter is one great mass of wonderful facts and
suggestions, and the whole profoundly interesting. I have
seldom been more gratified than by [your] honourable mention
of my work.
I should like to tell you one little observation which I
made with care many years ago ; I saw ants ( Formica rufa)
carrying cocoons from a nest which was the largest I ever saw
and which was well known to all the country people near, and
an old man, apparently about eighty years of age, told me
that he had known it ever since he was a boy. The ants
carrying the cocoons did not appear to be emigrating;
following the line, I saw many ascending a tall fir-tree still
carrying their cocoons. But when I looked closely I found
that all the cocoons were empty cases. This astonished me,
and next day I got a man to observe with me, and we again
saw ants bringing empty cocoons out of the nest ; each of us
fixed on one ant and slowly followed it, and repeated the
observation on many others. We thus found that some ants
soon dropped their empty cocoons ; others carried them for
many yards, as much as thirty paces, and others carried them
high up the fir-tree out of sight Now here I think we have
one instinct in contest with another and mistaken one. The
first instinct being to carry the empty cocoons out of the nest,
and it would have been sufficient to have laid them on the
heap of rubbish, as the first breath of wind would have blown
them away. And then came in the contest with the other
very powerful instinct of preserving and carrying their
cocoons as long as possible ; and this they could not help
doing although the cocoons were empty. According as the
one or other instinct was the stronger in each individual ant,
so did it carry the empty cocoon to a greater or less distance.
If this little observation should ever prove of any use to you,
you are quite at liberty to use it. Again thanking you

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to J. Fiske.
Down, December 8, 1874.
My DEAR Sir,  You must allow me to thank you for the
very great interest with which I have at last slowly read the
whole of your work.* I have long wished to know some-
thing about the views of the many great men whose doctrines
you give. With the exception of special points I did not
even understand H. Spencers general doctrine ; for his style
is too hard work for me. I never in my life read so lucid an
expositor (and therefore thinker) as you are ; and I think
that I understand nearly the whole  perhaps less clearly
about Cosmic Theism and Causation than other parts. It is
hopeless to attempt out of so much to specify what has
interested me most, and probably you would not care to hear.
I wish some chemist would attempt to ascertain the result of
the cooling of heated gases of the proper kinds, in relation
to your hypothesis of the origin of living matter. It pleased
me to find that here and there I had arrived from my own
crude thoughts at some of the same conclusions with you ;
though I could seldom or never have given my reasons for
such conclusions. I find that my mind is so fixed by the
inductive method, that I cannot appreciate deductive reason-
ing : I must begin with a good body of facts and not from a
principle (in which I always suspect some fallacy) and then

as much deduction as you please. This may be very narrow-
minded ; but the result is that such parts of H. Spencer as I
have read with care impress my mind with the idea of his
inexhaustible wealth of suggestion, but never convince me ;
and so I find it with some others. I believe the cause to lie
in the frequency with which I have found first-formed
theories [to be] erroneous. I thank you for the honourable
mention which you make of my works. Parts of the
Descent of Man must have appeared laughably weak to
you : nevertheless, I have sent you a new edition just
published. Thanking you for the profound interest and
profit with which I have read your work, I remain,
My dear Sir, yours very faithfully,

[The only work, not purely botanical, which occupied my
father in the present year was the correction of the second
edition of  The Variation of Animals and Plants, and on this
he was engaged from the beginning of July till October 3rd.
The rest of the year was taken up with his work on in-
sectivorous plants, and on cross-fertilisation, as will be shown
in a later chapter. The chief alterations in the second edition
of  Animals and Plants  are in the eleventh chapter on  Bud-
variation and on certain anomalous modes of reproduction;
the chapter on Pangenesis "was also largely altered and re-
modelled. He mentions briefly some of the authors who
have noticed the doctrine. Professor Delpinos 1 Sulla Dar-
winiana Teoria della Pangenesi (1869), an adverse but fair
criticism, seems to have impressed him as valuable. Of
another critic my father characteristically says,*  Dr. Lionel
Beale (Nature, May 11, 1871, p. 26) sneers at the whole
doctrine with much acerbity and some justice. He also
* * Animals and Plants, 2nd edit. voL ii. p. 3S��-

points out that, in Mantegazzas  Element! di Igiene, the
theory of Fangenesis was clearly forestalled.
In connection with this subject, a letter of my fathers to
Nature (April 27, 1871) should be mentioned. A paper by
Mr. Galton had been read before the Royal Society (March
30, 1871) in which were described experiments, on intertrans-
fusion of blood, designed to test the truth of the hypothesis
of pangenesis. My father, while giving all due credit to Mr.
Galton for his ingenious experiments, does not allow that
pangenesis has  as yet received its death-blow, though from
presenting so many vulnerable points its life is always in
jeopardy.
He seems to have found the work of correcting very
wearisome, for he wrote :
 I have no news about myself, as I am merely slaving over
the sickening work of preparing new editions. I wish I could
get a touch of poor Lyells feelings, that it was delightful to
improve a sentence, like a painter improving a picture.
The feeling of effort or strain over this piece of work, is
shown in a letter to Professor Haeckel :
 What I shall do in future if I live, Heaven only knows ;
I ought perhaps to avoid general and large subjects, as too
difficult for me with my advancing years, and I suppose
enfeebled brain.
At the end of March, in this year, the portrait for which he
was sitting to Mr. Ouless was finished. He felt the sittings a
great fatigue, in spite of Mr. Oulesss considerate desire to
spare him as far as was possible. In a letter to Sir J. D.
Hooker he wrote,  I look a very venerable, acute, melan-
choly old dog ; whether I really look so I do not know.
The picture is in the possession of the family, and is known
to many through M. Rajons etching. Mr. Oulesss portrait
is, in my opinion, the finest representation of my father that
has been produced.

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to Miss Buckley ( now Mrs. Fisher).*
Down, February 23, 1875.
My dear Miss Buckley,  I am grieved to hear of the
death of my old and kind friend, though I knew that it could
not be long delayed, and that it was a happy thing that his
life should not have been prolonged, as I suppose that his
mind would inevitably have suffered. I am glad that Lady
Lyell f has been saved this terrible blow. His death makes
me think of the time when I first saw him, and how full of
sympathy and interest he was about what I could tell him of
coral reefs and South America. I think that this sympathy
with the work of every other naturalist was one of the finest
features of his character. How completely he revolutionised
Geology : for I can remember something of pre-Lyellian days.
I never forget that almost everything which I have done in
science I owe to the study of his great works. Well, he has
had a grand and happy career, and no one ever worked with a
truer zeal in a noble cause. It seems strange to me that I
shall never again sit with him and Lady Lyell at their break-
fast. I am very much obliged to you for having so kindly
written to me.
CTTXTHR Pray give our kindest remembrances to Miss Lyell, and I
hope that she has not suffered much in health, from fatigue
and anxiety.

Down, February 25 [1875].
My dear Hooker,  Your letter so full of feeling has
interested me greatly. I cannot say that I felt his [Lyells]
death much, for I fully expected it, and have looked for some
little time at his career as finished.
I dreaded nothing so much as his surviving with impaired
mental powers. He was, indeed, a noble man in very many
ways ; perhaps in none more than in his warm sympathy with
the work of others. How vividly I can recall my first con-
versation with him, and how he astonished me by his interest
in what I told him. How grand also was his candour and
pure love of truth. Well, he is gone, and I feel as if we were
all soon to go. ... I am deeply rejoiced about West-
minster Abbey,* the possibility of which had not occurred to
me when I wrote before. I did think that his works were the
most enduring of all testimonials (as you say) to him ; but
then I did not like the idea of his passing away with no out-
ward sign of what scientific men thought of his merits. Now
all this is changed, and nothing can be better than West-
minster Abbey. Mrs. Lyell has asked me to be one of the
pall-bearers, but I have written to say that I dared not, as I
should so likely fail in the midst of the ceremony, and have
my head whirling off my shoulders. All this affair must have
cost you much fatigue and worry, and how I do wish you
were out of England. . . .

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to August Weismann.
Down, December 6, 1875.
My dear SIR,  I have been profoundly interested by your
essay on Amblystoma,* and think that you have removed a
great stumbling-block in the way of Evolution. I once thought
of reversion in this case ; but in a crude and imperfect manner.
I write now to call your attention to the sterility of moths
when hatched out of their proper season ; I give references in
chapter 18 of my Variation under Domestication (vol. ii.
  Umwandlung. dcs AxolotL
1875 ] . VIVISECTION; 199
p. 157, of English edition), and these cases illustrate, I think,
the sterility of Amblystoma. Would it not be worth while to
examine the reproductive organs of those individuals of wing-
less Hemiptera which occasionally have wings, as in the case
of the bed-bug? I think I have heard that the females of
Mutilla sometimes have wings. These cases must be due to
reversion. I dare say many anomalous cases will be hereafter
explained on the same principle.
I hinted at this explanation in the extraordinary case of
the black-shouldered peacock, the so-called Pavo nigripennis
given in my  Var. under Domest ;  and I might have been
bolder, as the variety is in many respects intermediate between
the two known species.
With much respect,
Yours sincerely,
C. Darwin.
THE VIVISECTION QUESTION.
[It was in November 1875 that my father gave his evidence
before the Royal Commission on Vivisection.* I have, there-
fore, placed together here the matter relating to this subject,
irrespective of date. Something has already been said of my
fathers strong feeling with regard to suffering f both in man
and beast It was indeed one of the strongest feelings in his
nature, and was exemplified in matters small and great, in
his sympathy with the educational miseries of dancing dogs,
or in his horror at the sufferings of slaves.
200 MISCELLANEA. [1875.
The remembrance of screams, or other sounds heard in
Brazil, when he was powerless to interfere with what he
believed to be the torture of a slave, haunted him for years,
especially at night. In smaller matters, where he could inter-
fere, he did so vigorously. He returned one day from his walk
pale and faint from having seen a horse ill-used, and from the
agitation of violently remonstrating with the man. On
another occasion he saw a horse-breaker teaching his son to
ride, the little boy was frightened and the man was rough ;
my father stopped, and jumping out of the carriage reproved
the man in no measured terms.
One other little incident may be mentioned, showing that
his humanity to animals was well known in his own neigh-
bourhood. A visitor, driving from Orpington to Down, told
the cabman to go faster. Why, said the man, if I had
whipped the horse this much, driving Mr. Darwin, he would
have got out of the carriage and abused me well.
With respect to the special point under consideration,  the
sufferings of animals subjected to experiment,  nothing could
show a stronger feeling than the following extract from a
letter to Professor Ray Lankester (March 22, 1871) :
 You ask about my opinion on vivisection. I quite agree
that it is justifiable for real investigations on physiology ; but
not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a
subject which makes me sick with horror, so I will not say
another word about it, else I shall not sleep to-night"
An extract from Sir Thomas Farrers notes shows how
strongly he expressed himself in a similar manner in con-
versation :
 The last time I had any conversation with him was at my
house in Bryanston Square, just before one of his last seizures.
He was then deeply interested in the vivisection question ;
Some time afterwards the patient that he had undoubtedly been in-
was discharged, and wrote to thank sane when he wrote his former
my father for his interference, adding letter.

and what he said made a deep impression on me. He was a
man eminently fond of animals and tender to them ; he would
not knowingly have inflicted pain on a living creature ; but
he entertained the strongest opinion that to prohibit experi-
ments on living animals, would be to put a stop to the know-
ledge of and the remedies for pain and disease."
The Anti- Vivisection agitation, to which the following
letters refer, seems to have become specially active in 1874, as
may be seen, eg. by the index to Nature for that year, in
which the word  Vivisection  suddenly comes into promi-
nence. But before that date the subject had received the
earnest attention of biologists. Thus at the Liverpool
Meeting of the British Association in 1870, a Committee
was appointed, whose report defined the circumstances and
conditions under which, in the opinion of the signatories,
experiments on living animals were justifiable. In the spring
of 1875, Lord Hartismere introduced a Bill into the Upper
House to regulate the course of physiological research.
Shortly afterwards a Bill more just towards science in its
provisions was introduced to the House of Commons by
Messrs. Lyon Playfair, Walpole, and Ashley. It was
however, withdrawn on the appointment of a Royal Com-
mission to inquire into the whole question. The Commis-
sioners were Lords Cardwell and Winmarleigh, Mr. W. E,
Forster, Sir J. B. Karslake, Mr. Huxley, Professor Erichssen,
and Mr. R. H. Hutton : they commenced their inquiry in
July, 1875, and the Report was published early in the follow-
ing year.
In the early summer of 1876, Lord Carnarvons Bill,
entitled,  An Act to amend the Law relating to Cruelty to
Animals, was introduced. It cannot be denied that the
framers of this Bill, yielding to the unreasonable clamour of
the public, went far beyond the recommendations of the
Royal Commission. As a correspondent in 1 Nature  put it

tion was recommended went beyond the facts, the Report
went beyond the evidence, the Recommendations beyond the
Report ; and the Bill can hardly be said to have gone beyond
the Recommendations ; but rather to have contradicted them.
The legislation which my father worked for, as described
in the following letters, was practically what was introduced
as Dr. Lyon Playfairs Bill.]
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to Mrs. Litchfield ?
January 4, 1875.
My DEAR H.  Your letter has led me to think over vivisec-
tion (I wish some new word like anaes-section could be
invented t) for some hours, and I will jot down my conclu-
sions, which will appear very unsatisfactory to you. I have
long thought physiology one of the greatest of sciences, sure
sooner, or more probably later, greatly to benefit mankind ;
but, judging from all other sciences, the benefits will accrue
only indirectly in the search for abstract truth. It is certain
that physiology can progress only by experiments on living
animals. Therefore the proposal to limit research to points
of which we can now see the bearings in regard to health, &c.,
I look at as puerile. I thought at first it would be good to
limit vivisection to public laboratories ; but I have heard only
of those in London and Cambridge, and I think Oxford ; but
probably there may be a .few others. Therefore only men
living in a few great towns would carry on investigation, and
this I should consider a great evil. If private men were per-
mitted to work in their own houses, and required a licence, I
do not see who is to determine whether any particular man
should receive one. It is young unknown men who are the

(Sept 30, 1880) an article by Dr.
Wilder, of Cornell University, an
abstract of which was published

use of the word  Callisection  for

most likely to do good work. I would gladly punish severely
any one who operated on an animal not rendered insensible, if
the experiment made this possible ; but here again I do not
see that a magistrate or jury could possibly determine such a
point Therefore I conclude, if (as is likely) some experi-
ments have been tried too often, or anaesthetics have not been
used when they could have been, the cure must be in the
improvement of humanitarian feelings. Under this point of
view I have rejoiced at the present agitation. If stringent
laws are passed, and this is likely, seeing how unscientific the
House of Commons is, and that the gentlemen of England
are humane, as long as their sports are not considered, which
entail a hundred or thousand-fold more suffering than the
experiments of physiologists  if such laws are passed, the
result will assuredly be that physiology, which has been until
within the last few years at a standstill in England, will
languish or quite cease. It will then be carried on solely on
the Continent ; and there will be so many the fewer workers
on this grand subject, and this I should greatly regret. By
the way, F. Balfour, who has worked for two or three years
in the laboratory at Cambridge, declares to George that he
has never seen an experiment, except with animals rendered
insensible. No doubt the names of doctors will have great
weight with the House of Commons ; but very many prac-
titioners neither know nor care anything about the progress
of knowledge. I cannot at present see my way to sign any
petition, without hearing what physiologists thought would
be its effect, and then judging for myself. I certainly could
not sign the paper sent me by Miss Cobbe.with its monstrous
(as it seems to me) attack on Virchow for experimenting on
the Trichinae. I am tired and so no more.

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to J. D. Hooker.
Down, April 14 [1875].
My DEAR Hooker.  I worked all the time in London on
the vivisection question ; and we now think it advisable to go
further than a mere petition. Litchfield* drew up a sketch
of a Bill, the essential features of which have been approved
by Sanderson, Simon and Huxley, and from conversation,
will, I believe, be approved by Paget, and almost certainly, I
think, by Michael Foster. Sanderson, Simon and Paget wish
me to see Lord Derby, and endeavour to gain his advocacy
with the Home Secretary. Now, if this is carried into effect,
it will be of great importance to me to be able to say that the
Bill in its essential features has the approval of some half-
dozen eminent scientific men. I have therefore asked
Litchfield to enclose a copy to you in its first rough form ;
and if it is not essentially modified, may I say that it meets
with your approval as President of the Royal Society ? The
object is to protect animals, and at the same time not to
injure Physiology, and Huxley and Sandersons approval
almost suffices on this head. Pray let me have a line from
you soon.
i Yours affectionately,
Charles Darwin.
[The Physiological Society, which was founded in 1876, was
in some measure the outcome of the anti-vivisection move-
ment, since it was this agitation which impressed on Physiolo-
gists the need of a centre for those engaged in this particular
branch of science. With respect to the Society, my father
wrote to Mr. Romanes (May 29, 1876):
 I was very much gratified by the wholly unexpected

The following letter appeared in the Times, April 18th,
1881 :]
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to Frithiof Holmgren .*
Down, April 14, 1881.
Dear Sir,  In answer to your courteous letter of April 7,
1 have no objection to express my opinion with respect to
the right of experimenting on living animals. I use this latter
expression as more correct and comprehensive than that of
vivisection. You are at liberty to make any use of this letter
which you may think fit, but if published I should wish the
whole to appear. I have all my life been a strong advocate
for humanity to animals, and have done what I could in my
writings to enforce this duty. Several years ago, when the
agitation against physiologists commenced in England, it
was asserted that inhumanity was here practised, and useless
suffering caused to animals ; and I was led to think that it
might be advisable to have an Act of Parliament on the
subject. I then took an active part in trying to get a Bill
passed, such as would have removed all just cause of com-
plaint, and at the same time have left physiologists free to
pursue their researches,  a Bill very different from the Act
which has since been passed. It is right to add that the
investigation of the matter by a Royal Commission proved
that the accusations made against our English physiologists
were false. From all that I have heard, however, I fear that
in some parts of Europe little regard is paid to the sufferings
of animals, and if this be the case, I should be glad to hear of
legislation against inhumanity in any such country. On the
other hand, I know that physiology cannot possibly progress
except by means of experiments on living animals, and I
feel the deepest conviction that he who retards the progress
of physiology commits a crime against mankind. Any one

who remembers, as I can, the state of this science half a
century ago, must admit that it has made immense progress,
and it is now progressing at an ever-increasing rate. What
improvements in medical practice may be directly attributed
to physiological research is a question which can be properly
discussed only by those physiologists and medical practitioners
who have studied the history of their subjects ; but, as far as
I can learn, the benefits are already great However this may
be, no one, unless he is grossly ignorant of what science has
done for mankind, can entertain any doubt of the incalculable
benefits which will hereafter be derived from physiology, not
only by man, but by the lower animals. Look for instance
at Pasteurs results in modifying the germs of the most
malignant diseases, from which, as it so happens, animals will
in the first place receive more relief than man. Let it be
remembered how many lives and what a fearful amount of
suffering have been saved by the knowledge gained of
parasitic worms through the experiments of Virchow and
others on living animals. In the future every one will be
astonished at the ingratitude shown, at least in England, to
these benefactors of mankind. As for myself, permit me to
assure you that I honour, and shall always honour, every one
who advances the noble science of physiology.
Dear Sir, yours faithfully,
Charles Darwin.

C. Darwin to the Editor of the ' Times.'
SIR,  I do not wish to discuss the views expressed by
Miss Cobbe in the letter which appeared in the Times of the
19th inst ; but as she asserts that I have  misinformed  my
correspondent in Sweden in saying that the investigation of
the matter by a Royal Commission proved that the accu-
sations made against our English physiologists were false,"
I will merely ask leave to refer to some other sentences
from the report 'of the Commission.
(1.) The sentence   It is not to be doubted that in-
humanity may be found in persons of very high position as
physiologists," which Miss Cobbe quotes from page 17 of the
report, and which, in her opinion, can necessarily concern
English physiologists alone and not foreigners, is imme-
diately followed by the words  We have seen that it was so
in Majendie." Majendie was a French physiologist who
became notorious some half century ago for his cruel
experiments on living animals.
(2.) The Commissioners, after speaking of the general
sentiment of humanity" prevailing in this country, say
(p. 10):
This principle is accepted generally by the very highly
educated men whose lives are devoted either to scientific
investigation and education or to the mitigation or the
removal of the sufferings of their fellow-creatures ; though
differences of degree in regard to its practical application
will be easily discernible by those who study the evidence as
it has been laid before us.
Again, according to the Commissioners (p. 10) :
 The secretary of the Royal Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, when asked whether the general tendency
of the scientific world in this country is at variance with
humanity, says he believes it to be very different, indeed,
from that of foreign physiologists ; and while giving it as the

are in their nature beyond any legitimate province of science,
and that the pain which they inflict is pain which it is not
justifiable to inflict even for the scientific object in view, he
readily acknowledges that he does not know a single case of
wanton cruelty, and that in general the English physiologists
have used anaesthetics where they think they can do so with
safety to the experiment"
I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
Charles Darwin.

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to G. J. Romanes.
Down, September 2, 1881.
My dear Romanes,  Your letter has perplexed me
beyond all measure. I fully recognise the duty of every one
whose opinion is worth anything, expressing his opinion pub-
licly on vivisection ; and this made me send my letter to the
Times. 1 have been thinking at intervals all morning what I
could say, and it is the simple truth that I have nothing worth
saying. You and men like you, whose ideas flow freely, and
who can express them easily, cannot understand the state
of mental paralysis in which I find myself. What is most
wanted is a careful and accurate attempt to show what physi-
ology has already done for man, and even still more strongly
what there is every reason to believe it will hereafter do.
Now I am absolutely incapable of doing this, or of discussing
the other points suggested by you.
If you wish for my name (and I should be glad that it
should appear with that of others in the same cause), could
you not quote some sentence from my letter in the Times
which I enclose, but please return it. If you thought fit you
might say you quoted it with my approval, and that after still
further reflection I still abide most strongly in my expressed
conviction.
For Heavens sake, do think of this. I do not grudge
the labour and thought; but I could write nothing worth
any one reading.

Allow me to demur to your calling your conjoint article a

very bad taste, and I do hope every one of you will avoid any
semblance of a joke on the subject. I know that words, like
a joke, on this subject have quite disgusted some persons not
at all inimical to physiology. One person lamented to me
that Mr. Simon, in his truly admirable Address at the Medical
Congress (by far the best thing which I have read), spoke of
the fantastic sensuality  (or some such term) of the many
mistaken, but honest men and women who are half mad on
the subject. . . ,

WORK THE BOOK ON EARTHWORMS LIFE OF ERASMUS
DARWIN MISCELLANEOUS LETTERS.
1876-1882.
[We have now to consider the work (other than botanical)
which occupied the concluding six years of my fathers life.
A letter to his old friend Rev. L. Blomfield (Jenyns), written
in March, 1877, shows what was my fathers estimate of his
own powers of work at this time :
My dear Jenyns (I see I have forgotten your proper
names),  Your extremely kind letter has given me warm
pleasure. As one gets old, ones thoughts turn back to the
past rather than to the future, and I often think of the
pleasant, and to me valuable, hours which I spent with you on
the borders of the Fens.
"You ask about my future work ; I doubt whether I shall
be able to do much more that is new, and I always keep
before my mind the example of poor old , who in his old
age had a cacoethcs for writing. But I cannot endure doing
nothing, so I suppose that I shall go on as long as I can
without obviously making a fool of myself. I have a great
mass of matter with respect to variation under nature ; but so
much has been published since the appearance of the ' Origin
of Species, that I very much doubt whether I retain power of
mind and strength to reduce the mass into a digested whole.
I have sometimes thought that I would try, but dread the
attempt. . . .
MISCELLANEA ( continued. ).
[1876.
His prophecy proved to be a true one with regard to any
continuation of any general work in the direction of Evolu-
tion, but his estimate of powers which could afterwards prove
capable of grappling with the Movements of Plants, and
with the work on  Earthworms, was certainly a low one.
The year 1876, with which the present chapter begins,
brought with it a revival of geological work. He had been
astonished, as I hear from Professor Judd, and as appears
in his letters, to learn that his books on  Volcanic Islands,
1844, and on South America, 1846, were still consulted
by geologists, and it was a surprise to him that new editions
should be required. Both these works were originally
published by Messrs. Smith and Elder, and the new edition
of 1876 was also brought out by them. This appeared in
one volume with the title Geological Observations on the
Volcanic Islands, and Parts of South America visited during
the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle . . He has explained in the
preface his reasons for leaving untouched the text of the
original editions :  They relate to parts of the world which
have been so rarely visited by men of science, that I am not
aware that much could be corrected or added from observa-
tions subsequently made. Owing to the great progress which
Geology has made within recent times, my views on some
few points may be somewhat antiquated ; but I have thought
it best to leave them as they originally appeared."
It may have been the revival of geological speculation,
due to the revision of his early books, that led to his re-
cording the observations of which some account is given in the
following letter. Part of it has been published in Professor
James Geikies  Prehistoric Europe, chaps, vii. and ix.,* a few
verbal alterations having been made at my fathers request in
the passages quoted. Mr. Geikie lately wrote to me: The

views suggested in his letter as to the origin of the angular
gravels, &c., in the South of England will, I believe, come
to be accepted as the truth. This question has a much
wider bearing than might at first appear. In point of fact
it solves one of the most difficult problems in Quaternary
Geology and has already attracted the attention of German
geologists.]
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to James Geikie.
Down, November 16, 1876.
My dear Sir,  I hope that you will forgive me for
troubling you with a very long letter. But first allow me to
tell you with what extreme pleasure and admiration I have
just finished reading your Great Ice Age. It seems to me
admirably done, and most clear. Interesting as many
chapters are in the history of the world, I do not think that
any one comes [up] nearly to the glacial period or periods.
Though I have steadily read much on the subject, your book
makes the whole appear almost new to me.
I am now going to mention a small observation, made by
me two or three years ago, near Southampton, but not fol-
lowed out, as I have no strength for excursions. I need say
nothing about the character of the drift there (which includes
palaeolithic celts), for you have described its essential features
in a few words at p. 506. It covers the whole country [in an]
even plain-like surface, almost irrespective of the present
outline of the land.
The coarse stratification has sometimes been disturbed. I
find that you allude  to the larger stones often standing on
end and this is the point which struck me so much. Not
only moderately sized angular stones, but small oval pebbles
often stand vertically up, in a manner which I have never seen
in ordinary gravel beds. This fact reminded me of what
occurs near my home, in the stiff red clay, full of unworn flints
over the chalk, which is no doubt the residue left undissolved
214 miscellanea ( continued . ). [1876.
by rain water. In this clay, flints as long and thin as my arm
often stand perpendicularly up ; and I have been told by the
tank-diggers that it is their  natural position  ! I presume
that this position may safely be attributed to the differential
movement of parts of the red clay as it subsided very slowly
from the dissolution of the underlying chalk ; so that the
flints arrange themselves in the lines of least resistance. The
similar but less strongly marked arrangement of the stones in
the drift near Southampton makes me suspect that it also
must have slowly subsided ; and the notion has crossed my
mind that during the commencement and height of the glacial
period great beds of frozen snow accumulated over the south
of England, and that, during the summer, gravel and stones
were washed from the higher land over its surface, and
in superficial channels. The larger streams may have cut
right through the frozen snow, and deposited gravel in lines
at the bottom. But on each succeeding autumn, when the
running water failed, I imagine that the lines of drainage
would have been filled up by blown snow afterwards con-
gealed, and that, owing to great surface accumulations of snow,
it would be a mere chance whether the drainage, together with
gravel and sand, would follow the same lines during the next
summer. Thus, as I apprehend, alternate layers of frozen
snow and drift, in sheets and lines, would ultimately have
covered the country to a great thickness, with lines of drift
probably deposited in various directions at the bottom by
the larger streams. As the climate became warmer, the
lower beds of frozen snow would have melted with extreme
slowness, and the many irregular beds of interstratified drift
would have sunk down with equal slowness ; and during this
movement the elongated pebbles would have arranged them-
selves more or less vertically. The drift would also have been
deposited almost irrespective of the outline of the under-
lying land. When I viewed the country I could not per-
suade myself that any flood, however great, could have depo-

sited such coarse gravel over the almost level platforms
between the valleys. My view differs from that of Holst,
p. 415 [Great Ice Age], of which I had never heard, as his
relates to channels cut through glaciers, and mine to beds
of drift interstratified with frozen snow where no glaciers
existed. The upshot of this long letter is to ask you to
keep my notion in your head, and look out for upright
pebbles in any lowland country which you may examine,
where glaciers have not existed. Or if you think the notion
deserves any further thought, but not otherwise, to tell any
one of it, for instance Mr. Skertchly, who is examining such
districts. Pray forgive me for writing so long a letter, and
again thanking you for the great pleasure derived from your
book,
I remain yours very faithfully,
C. Darwin.
P.S. ... I am glad that you have read Blytt ;* his paper
seemed to me a most important contribution to Botanical
Geography. How curious that the same conclusions should
have been arrived at by Mr. Skertchly, who seems to be a
first-rate observer ; and this implies, as I always think, a
sound theoriser.
I have told my publisher to send you in two or three days
a copy (second edition) of my geological work during the
voyage of the Beagle. The sole point which would perhaps
interest you is about the steppe-like plains of Patagonia

must have been the level of the sea, and not that of the land
which has changed.

and though I knew how kind-hearted [he was], yet the book
has raised him greatly in my respect, notwithstanding his
foibles and want of broad philosophical views.
[The only other geological work of his later years was
embodied in his book on earthworms (1881), which may
therefore be conveniently considered in this place. This
subject was one which had interested him many years before
this date, and in 1838 a paper on the formation of mould
was published in the Proceedings of the Geological Society
(see vol. i. p. 284).
Here he showed that fragments of burnt marl, cinders, &c,
which had been thickly strewed over the surface of several
meadows were found after a few years lying at a depth of
some inches beneath the turf, but still forming a layer. For
the explanation of this fact, which forms the central idea of
the geological part of the book, he was indebted to his unde
Josiah Wedgwood, who suggested that worms, by bringing
earth to the surface in their castings, must undermine any
objects lying on the surface and cause an apparent sinking.
In the book of 1881 he extended his observations on this
burying action, and devised a number of different ways of
checking his estimates as to the amount of work done.* He
also added a mass of observations on the habits, natural
history and intelligence of worms, a part of the work which
added greatly to its popularity.
In 1877 Sir Thomas Farrer had discovered close to his
garden the remains of a building of Roman-British times,
and thus gave my father the opportunity of seeing for himself

the effects produced by earthworms on the old concrete-floors,
walls, &c. CTTXTHR On his return he wrote to Sir Thomas Farrer :
"I cannot remember a more delightful week than the last.
I know very well that E. will not believe me, but the worms
were by no means the sole charm.
In the autumn of 1880, when the  Power of Movements in
Plants was nearly finished, he began once more on the
subject. CTTXTHR He wrote to Professor Carus (September 21) :
* In the intervals of correcting the press, I am writing a
very little book, and have done nearly half of it. Its title
will be (as at present designed),  The Formation of Vegetable
Mould through the Action of Worms.  As far as I can judge
it will be a curious little book.
The manuscript was sent to the printers in April, 1881,
and when the proof-sheets were coming in he wrote to Pro-
fessor Carus :  The subject has been to me a hobby-horse, and
I have perhaps treated it in foolish detail.
It was published on October 10, and 2000 copies were sold
at once. CTTXTHR He wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker,  I am glad that
you approve of the Worms. When in old days I was to
tell you whatever I was doing, if you were at all interested, I
always felt as most men do when their work is finally pub-
lished.

book may be roughly estimated by the fact that, in the three
years following its publication, 8500 copies were sold a
sale relatively greater than that of the * Origin of Species.
It is not difficult to account for its success with the non-
scientific public. Conclusions so wide and so novel, and so
easily understood, drawn from the study of creatures so
familiar, and treated with unabated vigour and freshness,
may well have attracted many readers. A reviewer remarks:
In the eyes of most men. . . the earthworm is a mere
blind, dumb, senseless, and unpleasantly slimy annelid
Mr. Darwin undertakes to rehabilitate his character, and the
earthworm steps forth at once as an intelligent and beneficent
personage, a worker of vast geological changes, a planer
down of mountain sides ... a friend of man . . . and an
ally of the Society for the preservation of ancient monu-
ments. The St. James's Gazette, of October 17th, 1881,
pointed out that the teaching of the cumulative importance
of the infinitely little is the point of contact between this
book and the authors previous work.
One more book remains to be noticed, the  Life of Erasmus
Darwin.
In February 1879 an essay by Dr. Ernst Krause, on the
scientific work of Erasmus Darwin, appeared in the evolu-
tionary journal, Kosmos, The number of Kosmos in
question was a " Gratulationsheft, * or special congratulatory
issue in honour of my fathers birthday, so that Dr. Krauses
essay, glorifying the older evolutionist, was quite in its place.
CTTXTHR He wrote to Dr. Krause, thanking him cordially for the honour
paid to Erasmus, and asking his permission to publish t an
English translation of the Essay.
* The same number contains a
good biographical sketch of my
father, of which the material was to
a large extent supplied by him to

t The wish to do so was shared
by his brother, Erasmus Darwin
the younger, who continued to be
associated with the project.
J879-] ERASMUS DARWIN. 219
His chief reason for writing a notice of his grandfathers
life was  to contradict flatly some calumnies by Miss Seward.
This appears from a letter of March 27, 1879, to his cousin
Reginald Darwin, in which he asks for any documents and
letters which might throw light on the character of Erasmus.
CTTXTHR This led to Mr. Reginald Darwin placing in my fathers hands
a quantity of valuable material, including a curious folio
common-place book, of which he wrote : " I have been
deeply interested by the great book reading and
looking at it is like having communion with the dead ....
[it] has taught me a good deal about the occupations and
tastes of our grandfather. A subsequent letter (April 8) to
the same correspondent describes the source of a further
supply of material :
 Since my last letter I have made a strange discovery ;
for an old box from my father marked * Old Deeds, and
which consequently I had never opened, I found full of
letters  hundreds from Dr. Erasmus  and others from old
members of the family : some few very curious. Also a
drawing of Elston before it was altered, about 1750, of which
I think I will give a copy.
Dr. Krauses contribution formed the second part of the
 Life of Erasmus Darwin, my father supplying a  preliminary
notice. This expression on the title-page is somewhat mis-
leading ; my father's contribution is more than half the book,
and should have been described as a biography. Work of
this kind was new to him, and he wrote doubtfully to Mr.
Thiselton Dyer, June 18th : God only knows what I shall
make of his life, it is such a new kind of work to me." The
strong interest he felt about his forebears helped to give
zest to the work, which became a decided enjoyment to him.
With the general public the book was not markedly success-
ful, but many of his friends recognised its merits. Sir J. D.
Hooker was one of these, and to him my father wrote,
 Your praise of the Life of Dr. D. has pleased me exceed-

ingly, for I despised my work, and thought myself a perfect
fool to have undertaken such a job."
To Mr. Galton, too, he wrote, November 14 :
 I am extremely glad that you approve of the little Life'
of our grandfather, for I have been repenting that I ever
undertook it, as the work was quite beyond my tether.
The publication of the * Life of Erasmus Darwin  led to an
attack by Mr. Samuel Butler, which amounted to a charge
of falsehood against my father. After consulting his friends,
he came to the determination to leave the charge unanswered,
as being unworthy of his notice.* Those who wish to know
more of the matter, may gather the facts of the case from Ernst
Krause's  Charles Darwin, and they will find Mr. Butlers
statement of his grievance in the Athenceum , January 31, 1880,
and in the St. Jamess Gazette, December 8, 1880. The affair
gave my father much pain, but the warm sympathy of those
whose opinion he respected soon helped him to let it pass into
a well-merited oblivion.

see them. I feel sure that you would not be unjust to even
an insect, much less to a man. Now, you have been misled
by some translator, for my grandfather, Erasmus Darwin,
states ( Zoonomia, voL i. p. 183, 1794) that it was a wasp
(gu��pe) which he saw cutting off the wings of a large fly. I
have no doubt that you are right in saying that the wings are
generally cut off instinctively ; but in the case described by
my grandfather, the wasp, after cutting off the two ends of
the body, rose in the air, and was turned round by the wind ;
he then alighted and cut off the wings. I must believe, with
Pierre Huber, that insects have  une petite dose de raison.
In the next edition of your book, I hope that you will alter
fart of what you say about my grandfather.
I am sorry that you are so strongly opposed to the Descent
theory ; I have found the searching for the history of each

sympathised deeply with you.*
With the most sincere respect,

Charles Darwin.
P.S.  Allow me to make a suggestion in relation to your
wonderful account of insects finding their way home. I for-
merly wished to try it with pigeons : namely, to carry the
insects in their paper  comets, about a hundred paces in the
opposite direction to that which you ultimately intended to
cany them ; but before turning round to return, to put the
insect in a circular box, with an axle which could be made to

revolve very rapidly, first in one direction, and then in
another, so as to destroy for a time all sense of direction in
the insects. I have sometimes imagined that animals may
feel in which direction they were at the first start carried.* If
this plan failed, I had intended placing the pigeons within an
induction coil, so as to disturb any magnetic or dia-magnetic
sensibility, which it seems just possible that they may
possess. C. D.
[During the latter years of my fathers life there was a
growing tendency in the public to do him honour. In 1877
he received the honorary degree of LL.D.from the University
of Cambridge. The degree was conferred on November 17,
and with the customary Latin speech from the Public Orator,
concluding with the words :  Tu vero, qui leges naturae tam
docte illustraveris, legum doctor nobis esto.
The honorary degree led to a movement being set on foot
in the University to obtain some permanent memorial of my
father. A sum of about ��400 was subscribed, and after the
rejection of the idea that a bust would be the best memorial,
a picture was determined on. In June 1879 he sat to Mr. W.
Richmond for the portrait in the possession of the University,
now placed in the Library of the Philosophical Society at
Cambridge. He is represented seated in a Doctors gown,
the head turned towards the spectator : the picture has many
admirers, but, according to my own view, neither the attitude
nor the expression are characteristic of my father.
A similar wish on the part of the Linnean Society  with
which my father was so closely associated  led to his sitting
* This idea was a favourite one
with him, and he has described in
* Nature (vol. vii. 1873, p. 360) the
behaviour of his cob Tommy, in
whom he fancied he detected a sense
of direction. The horse had been
taken by rail from Kent to the Isle of
Wight ; when there he exhibited a
marked desire to go eastward, even
when his stable lay in the opposite
direction. In the same volume of
Nature, p. 417, is a letter on the
 Origin of Certain Instincts, which
contains a short discussion on the
sense of direction.

in CTTXTHR August, 1881, to Mr. John Collier, for the portrait now in
the possession of the Society. Of the artist, he wrote,
'Collier was the most considerate, kind and pleasant painter a
sitter could desire. The portrait represents him standing
facing the observer in the loose cloak so familiar to those who
knew him, and with his slouch hat in his hand. Many of
those who knew his face most intimately, think that Mr.
Colliers picture is the best of the portraits, and in this
judgment the sitter himself was inclined to agree. According
to my feeling it is not so simple or strong a representation of
him as that given by Mr. Ouless. There is a certain expres-
sion in Mr. Colliers portrait which I am inclined to consider
an exaggeration of the almost painful expression which
Professor Cohn has described in my fathers face, and which he
had previously noticed in Humboldt Professor Cohns remarks
occur in a pleasantly written account of a visit to Down*
in 1876, published in the Breslauer Zcitung, April 23, 1882.
Besides the Cambridge degree, he received about the same
time honours of an academic kind from some foreign societies..
On August 5, 1878, he was elected a Corresponding
Member of the French Institute! in the Botanical Section,!
and wrote to Dr. Asa Gray :
 I see that we are both elected Corresponding Members
 In this connection may be
mentioned a visit (1881) from
another distinguished German,
Hans Richter. The occurrence is
otherwise worthy of mention, inas-
much as it led to the publication,
after my fathers death, of Herr
Richters recollections of the visit
The sketch is simply and sympa-
thetically written, and the author
has succeeded in giving a true
picture of my father as he lived at
Down. It appeared in the Neue
Tagblatt of Vienna, and was repub-
lished by Dr. O. Zacharias in his

great scandal that Darwin was so
long kept out of the French Insti-
tute. As he said, even if the de-

to, Darwins original works on

other subjects, constituted a more
than sufficient claim.  From Pro-

of the Institute. It is rather a good joke that I should be
elected in the Botanical Section, as the extent of ray know-
ledge is little more than that a daisy is a Compositous plant
and a pea a Leguminous one.
In the early part of the same year he was elected a Corre-
sponding Member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and
he wrote (CTTXTHR March 12) to Professor Du Bois Reymond, who had
proposed him for election :
 I thank you sincerely for your most kind letter, in which
you announce the great honour conferred on me. The know-
ledge of the names of the illustrious men, who seconded the
proposal is even a greater pleasure to me than the honour itself."
The seconders were Helmholtz, Peters, Ewald, Pringsheim
and Virchow.
In 1879 he received the Baly Medal of the Royal College
of Physicians.*

BRESSA PRIZE.
22S
Again in 1879 he received from the Royal Academy of
Turin the Bressa Prize for the years 1875-78, amounting
to the sum of 12,000 francs. In the following year he
received on his birthday, as on previous occasions, a kind
letter of congratulation from Dr. Dohrn of Naples. In
writing (February 15th) to thank him and the other
naturalists at the Zoological Station, my father added :
Perhaps you saw in the papers that the Turin Society
honoured me to an extraordinary degree by awarding me
the Bressa Prize. Now it occurred to me that if your station
wanted some piece of apparatus, of about the value of ��vx>,
I should very much like to be allowed to pay for it Will
you be so kind as to keep this in mind, and if any want
should occur to you, I would send you a cheque at any
I find from my fathers accounts that ��100 was presented
to the Naples Station.
He received also several tokens of respect and sympathy of
a more private character from various sources. With regard
to such incidents, and to the estimation of the publicgenerally,
his attitude may be illustrated by a passage from a letter to
Mr. Romanes :*
You have indeed passed a most magnificent eulogium
upon me, and I wonder that you were not afraid of hearing
oh! oh! or some other sign of disapprobation. Many
persons think that what I have done in science has been
much overrated, and I very often think so myself ; but my
comfort is that I have never consciously done anything to
gain applause. Enough and too much about my dear self.
Among such expressions of regard he valued very highly
the two photographic albums received from Germany and
Holland on his birthday, 1877. Herr Emil Rade of Munster,
originated the idea of the German birthday gift, and under-

took the necessary arrangements. To him my father wrote
(February 16, 1877) :
 I hope that you will inform the one hundred and fifty-four
men of science, including some of the most highly honoured
names in the world, how grateful I am for their kindness and
generous sympathy in having sent me their photographs on
my birthday.
To Professor Haeckel he wrote (February 16, 1877)
 The album has just arrived quite safe. It is most superb.*
It is by far the greatest honour which I have ever received,
and my satisfaction has been greatly enhanced, by your most
kind letter of February 9. ... I thank you all from my
heart. I have written by this post to Herr Rade, and I hope
he will somehow manage to thank all my generous friends.
To Professor A. van Bemmelen he wrote, on receiving a
similar present from a number of distinguished men and
lovers of Natural History in the Netherlands :
 SIR,  I received yesterday the magnificent present of the
album, together with your letter. I hope that you will
endeavour to find some means to express to the two hundred
and seventeen distinguished observers and lovers of natural
science, who have sent me their photographs, my gratitude
for their extreme kindness. I feel deeply gratified by this
gift, and I do not think that any testimonial more honourable
to me could have been imagined. I am well aware that my
books could never have been written, and would not have
made any impression on the public mind, had not an immense
amount of material been collected by a long series of admir-
able observers ; and it is to them that honour is chiefly due.
I suppose that every worker at science occasionally feels
depressed, and doubts whether what he has published has
been worth the labour which it has cost him, but for the few

remaining years of my life, whenever I want cheering, I will
look at the portraits of my distinguished co-workers in the
field of science, and remember their generous sympathy.
When I die, the album will be a most precious bequest to my
children. I must further express my obligation for the very
interesting history contained in your letter of the progress of
opinion in the Netherlands, with respect to Evolution, the
whole of which is quite new to me. I must again thank all
my kind friends, from my heart, for their ever-memorable
testimonial, and I remain, Sir,
Your obliged and grateful servant,
Charles R. Darwin.
[In the June of the following year (1878) he was gratified
by learning that the Emperor of Brazil had expressed a wish
to meet him. Owing to absence from home my father was
unable to comply with this wish ; he wrote to Sir J. D.
Hooker :
 The Emperor has done so much for science, that every
scientific man is bound to show him the utmost respect,
and I hope that you will express in the strongest language,
and which you can do with entire truth, how greatly I feel
honoured by his wish to see me ; and how much I regret my
absence from home."
Finally it should be mentioned that in 1880 he received an
address personally presented by members of the Council of
the Birmingham Philosophical Society, as well as a memorial
from the Yorkshire Naturalist Union presented by some of
the members, headed by Dr. Sorby. He also received in the
same year a visit from some of the members of the Lewisham
and Blackheath Scientific Association,  a visit which was, I
think, enjoyed by both guests and host]

MISCELLANEA ( continued ).
MISCELLANEOUS LETTERS  1876-1882.
[The chief incident of a personal kind (not already dealt
with) in the years which we are now considering was the
death of his brother Erasmus, who died at his house in Queen
Anne Street, on August 26th, 1881. My father wrote to
Sir J. D. Hooker (Aug. 30) :
 The death of Erasmus is a very heavy loss to all of us, for
he had a most affectionate disposition. He always appeared
to me the most pleasant and clearest headed man, whom I
have ever known. London will seem a strange place to me
without his presence ; I am deeply glad that he died without
any great suffering, after a very short illness from mere
weakness and not from any definite disease.*
 I cannot quite agree with you about the death of the old
and young. Death in the latter case, when there is a bright
future ahead, causes grief never to be wholly obliterated.
An incident of a happy character may also be selected for
especial notice, since it was one which strongly moved my
fathers sympathy. A letter (CTTXTHR Dec. 17, 1879) to Sir Joseph
Hooker shows that the possibility of a Government Pension
being conferred on Mr. Wallace first occurred to my father at
this time. The idea was taken up by others, and my fathers
letters show that he felt the most lively interest in the success
of the plan. CTTXTHR He wrote, for instance, to Mrs. Fisher,  I hardly
ever wished for anything more than I do for the success
of our plan." He was deeply pleased when this thoroughly
deserved honour was bestowed on his friend, and wrote
to the same correspondent (January 7, 1881), on receiving}
letter from Mr. Gladstone announcing the fact : " How extra-

The letters which follow are of a miscellaneous character
and refer principally to the books he read, and to his minor
writings.]
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to Miss Buckley (Mrs. Fisher).
Down, February 11 [1876].
My dear Miss Buckley, You must let me have the
pleasure of saying that I have just finished reading with very
great interest your new book.f The idea seems to me a
capital one, and as far as I can judge very well carried out.
There is much fascination in taking a birds eye view of all
the grand leading steps in the progress of science. At first I
regretted that you had not kept each science more separate ;
but I dare say you found it impossible. I have hardly any
criticisms, except that I think you ought to have introduced
Murchison as a great classifier of formations, second only to
W. Smith. You have done full justice, and not more than
justice, to our dear old master, Lyell. Perhaps a little more
ought to have been said about botany, and if you should ever
add this, you would find Sachs' 1 History, lately published,
very good for your purpose.
You have crowned Wallace and myself with much honour
and glory. I heartily congratulate you on having produced
so novel and interesting a work, and remain,
My dear Miss Buckley, yours very faithfully,

[Hopedene] , June 5, 1876.
My DEAR WALLACE,  I must have the pleasure of ex-
pressing to you my unbounded admiration of your booty
tho I have read only to page 184  my object having been
to do as little as possible while resting. I feel sure that you
have laid a broad and safe foundation for all future work on
Distribution. How interesting it will be to see hereafter
plants treated in strict relation to your views ; and then all
insects, pulmonate molluscs and fresh-water fishes, in greater
detail than I suppose you have given to these lower animals.
The point which has interested me most, but I do not say the
most valuable point, is your protest against sinking imaginary
continents in a quite reckless manner, as was stated by Forbes,
followed, alas, by Hooker, and caricatured by Wollaston and
[Andrew] Murray! By the way, the main impression that
the latter author has left on my mind is his utter want of all
scientific judgment I have lifted up my voice against the
above view with no avail, but I have no doubt that you will
succeed, owing to your new arguments and the coloured chart.
Of a special value, as it seems to me, is the conclusion that
we must determine the areas, chiefly by the nature of the
mammals. When I worked many years ago on this subject,
I doubted much whether the now called Palaearctic and
Nearctic regions ought to be separated ; and I determined if I
made another region that it should be Madagascar. I have,
therefore, been able to appreciate your evidence on these
points. What progress Palaeontology has made during the
last 20 years ; but if it advances at the same rate in the
future, our views on the migration and birth-place of the
various groups will, I fear, be greatly altered. I cannot feel
quite easy about the Glacial period, and the extinction of large

mammals, but I must hope that you are right. I think you
will have to modify your belief about the difficulty of
dispersal of land molluscs ; I was interrupted when beginning
to cxperimentize on the just hatched young adhering to the
feet of ground-roosting birds. I differ on one other point,
viz. in the belief that there must have existed a Tertiary
Antarctic continent, from which various forms radiated to the
southern extremities of our present continents. But I could
go on scribbling for ever. You have written, as I believe, a
grand and memorable work which will last for years as the
foundation for all future treatises on Geographical Distribution.
My dear Wallace, yours very sincerely,
Charles Darwin.

by what you say of your work in relation to my chapters on

to me more difficult to explain than even the colours of cater-

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to Melchior Neumayr* Vienna.
Down, Beckenham, Kent, March 9, 1877.

I finished only yesterday your essay on 1 Die Congerien, &cf
I hope that you will allow me to express my gratitude for
the pleasure and instruction which I have derived from read-

far the best case which I have ever met with, showing the
direct influence of the conditions of life on the organization.
Mr. Hyatt, who has been studying the Hilgendorf case,
writes to me with respect to the conclusions at which he has
arrived, and these are nearly the same as yours. He insists
that closely similar forms may be derived from distinct lines
of descent ; and this is what I formerly called analogical
variation. There can now be no doubt that species may
become greatly modified through the direct action of the
environment. I have some excuse for not having formerly
insisted more strongly on this head in my  Origin of Species,

My dear Sir,  You must allow me just to tell you how
very much I have been interested with the excellent Address *
which you have been so kind as to send me, and which I had
much wished to read. I believe that I had read all, or very
nearly all, the papers by your countrymen to which you refer,
but I have been fairly astonished at their number and im-
portance when seeing them thus put together. I quite agree
about the high value of Mr. Allens works, t as showing how
much change may be expected apparently through the direct
action of the conditions of life. As for the fossil remains in
the West, no words will express how wonderful they are.
There is one point which I regret that you did not make clear
in your Address, namely what is the meaning and importance
of Professors Cope and Hyatts views on acceleration and
retardation. I have endeavoured, and given up in despair,
the attempt to grasp their meaning.
Permit me to thank you cordially for the kind feeling
shown towards me through your Address, and I remain, my

If my MS. is printed, I think that I had better see a proof.

[The two following extracts show the lively interest he
preserved in diverse fields of inquiiy. Professor Cohn, of
Breslau, had mentioned, in a letter, Kochs researches on
Splenic Fever ; my father replied, January 3 :
 I well remember saying to myself, between twenty and
thirty years ago, that if ever the origin of any infectious
disease could be proved, it would be the greatest triumph to
science ; and now I rejoice to have seen the triumph.
In the spring he received a copy of Dr. E. von Mojsisovics
Dolomit Riffe; his letter to the author (June 1, 1878) is
interesting, as bearing on the influence of his own work on
the methods of geology.

established, and then taking the graduated changes of the
same group of organisms as the true standard ! I never
hoped to live to see such a step even proposed by any one.
Another geological research which roused my fathers
admiration was Mr. D. Mackintoshs work on erratic blocks.
Apart from its intrinsic merit the work keenly excited his
sympathy from the conditions under which it was executed,
Mr. Mackintosh being compelled to give nearly his whole
time to tuition. The following passage is from a letter to
Mr. Mackintosh of October 9, 1879, and refers to his paper in
the Journal of the Geological Society, 1878 :
I hope that you will allow me to have the pleasure of

any one who had taken the trouble to read the book, more
especially as in the opening lines of the introduction I specify
how the subject arose in my mind. This answer disposes of
your two other questions ; but I may add that, many years
ago, when I was collecting facts for the  Origin, my belief in
what is called a personal God was as firm as that of Dr.
Pusey himself, and as to the eternity of matter I have never
troubled myself about such insoluble questions. Dr. Posey's
attack will be as powerless to retard by a day the belief in
Evolution, as were the virulent attacks made by divines fifty
years ago against Geology, and the still older ones of the
Catholic Church against Galileo, for the public is wise enough
always to follow Scientific men when they agree on any
subject ; and now there is almost complete unanimity
amongst Biologists about Evolution, though there is still
considerable difference as to the means, such as how far
natural selection has acted, and how far external conditions,
or whether there exists some mysterious innate tendency to
perfectibility. I remain, dear Sir,

[Theologians were not the only adversaries of freedom in
science. On Sept. 22, 1877, Prof. Virchow delivered an address
at the Munich meeting of German Naturalists and Physicians,
which had the effect of connecting Socialism with the Descent

tionists to such an extent that, according to Haeckel, the

attempts of the democrats Hodel and Nobiling . . . directly

puzzled to answer. I fancy that the general reader would
prefer your account of Japan. For myself I hesitate between
your discussions and description of the Southern ice, which
seems to me admirable, and the last chapter which contained
many facts and views new to me, though I had read your

You have also collected a surprising number of valuable
facts bearing on the disposal of plants, far more than in any
other book known to me. In fact your volume is a mass of
interesting facts and discussions, with hardly a superfluous
word ; and I heartily congratulate you on its publication.
Your dedication makes me prouder than ever.
Believe me, yours sincerely,

[In November, 1879, he answered for Mr. Galton a series of
questions for his  Inquiries into Human Faculty, 1883. He
wrote to Mr. Galton :
 I have answered the questions as well as I could, but they
are miserably answered, for I have never tried looking into
my own mind. Unless others answer very much better than
I can do, you will get no good from your queries. Do you
not think you ought to have the age of the answerer? I
think so, because I can call up faces of many schoolboys, not
seen for sixty years, with much distinctness, but nowadays I

[In 1880 he published a short paper in Nature (vol
xxi. p. 207) on the Fertility of Hybrids from the com-
mon and Chinese goose. He received the hybrids from
the Rev. Dr. Goodacre, and was glad of the opportunity of
testing the accuracy of the statement that these species arc
fertile inter se. This fact, which was given in the * Origin' on
the authority of Mr. Eyton, he considered the most remark-
able as yet recorded with respect to the fertility of hybrids.
The fact (as confirmed by himself and Dr. Goodacre) is of
interest as giving another proof that sterility is no criterion
of specific difference, since the two species of goose now
shown to be fertile inter se are so distinct that they have
been placed by some authorities in distinct genera or sub-
genera.

Daily News, and more especially from the accounts given me
by three of my children. I suppose that you have not
written out your lecture, so I fear there is no chance of its
being printed in extenso. You appear to have piled, as on
so many other occasions, honours high and thick on my old
head. But I well know how great a part you have played in
establishing and spreading the belief in the descent-theory,
ever since that grand review in the Times and the battle
royal at Oxford up to the present day.

[In November, 1880, he received an account of a flood in
Brazil, from which his friend Fritz Muller had barely escaped
with his life. CTTXTHR My father immediately wrote to Hermann Muller
anxiously enquiring whether his brother had lost books, instru-
ments, &c., by this accident, and begging in that case  for the
sake of science, so that science should not suffer, to be allowed
to help in making good the loss. Fortunately, however, the
injury to Fitz Mullers possessions was not so great as was
expected, and the incident remains only as a memento, which
I trust cannot be otherwise than pleasing to the survivor, of
the friendship of the two naturalists.
In Nature (November 11, 1880) appeared a letter from
my father, which is, I believe, the only instance in which
he wrote publicly with anything like severity. The late
Sir Wyville Thomson wrote, in the Introduction to the
 Voyage of the Challenger  .-  The character of the abyssal
fauna refuses to give the least support to the theory which
refers the evolutiori of species to extreme variation guided
only by natural selection. My father, after characterising
these remarks as a  standard of criticism, not uncommonly
reached by theologians and metaphysicians, goes on to take

that :  In 1875, the discovery of
the toothed birds of the cretaceous

exception to the term extreme variation, and challenges
Sir Wyville to name any one who has "said that the evolu-
tion of species depends only on natural selection. The letter
closes with an imaginary scene between Sir Wyville and a
breeder, in which Sir Wyville criticises artificial selection in
a somewhat similar manner. The breeder is silent, but on
the departure of his critic he is supposed to make use of
emphatic but irreverent language about naturalists. The
letter, as originally written, ended with a quotation from
Sedgwick on the invulnerability of those who write on what
they do not understand, but this was omitted on the advice
of a friend, and curiously enough a friend whose combative-
ness in the good cause my father had occasionally curbed.]

Down, April 16, 1881.
My dear Romanes,  My MS. on * Worms  has been sent
to the printers, so I am going to amuse myself by scribbling
to you on a few points ; but you must not waste your time
in answering at any length this scribble.
Firstly, your letter on intelligence was very useful to me
and I tore up and re-wrote what I sent to you. I have not
attempted to define intelligence ; but have quoted your
remarks on experience, and have shown how far they apply
to worms. It seems to me that they must be said to work
with some intelligence, anyhow they are not guided by a
blind instinct.
Secondly, I was greatly interested by the abstract in
' Nature  of your work on Echinoderms,* the complexity with
simplicity, and with such curious co-ordination of the nervous
system is marvellous ; and you showed me before what
splendid gymnastic feats they can perform.

Thirdly, Dr. Roux has sent me a book just published by
him:  Der Kampf der Theile, &c., 1881 (240 pages in
length).
He is manifestly a well-read physiologist and pathologist,
and from his position a good anatomist It is full of reason-
ing, and this in German is very difficult to me, so that I have
only skimmed through each page ; here and there reading
with a little more care. As far as I can imperfectly judge, it
is the most important book on Evolution which has appeared
for some time. I believe that G. H. Lewes hinted at the
same fundamental idea, viz. that there is a struggle going on
within every organism between the organic molecules, the
cells and the organs. I think that his basis is, that every cell
which best performs its function is, in consequence, at the same
time best nourished and best propagates its kind. The book
does not touch on mental phenomena, but there is much
discussion on rudimentary or atrophied parts, to which
subject you formerly attended. Now if you would like to
read this book, I would send it . . . If you read it, and are
struck with it (but I may be wholly mistaken about its value),
you would do a public service by analysing and criticising it
in Nature.
Dr. Roux makes, I think, a gigantic oversight in never con-
sidering plants ; these would simplify the problem for him.
Fourthly, I do not know whether you will discuss in your
book on the mind of animals any of the more complex and
wonderful instincts. It is unsatisfactory work, as there can
be no fossilised instincts, and the sole guide is their state in
other members of the same order, and mere probability.
But if you do discuss any (and it will perhaps be expected
of you), I should think that you could not select a better case
than that of the sand wasps, which paralyse their prey, as
formerly described by Fabre, in his wonderful paper in the
Annales des Sciences, and since amplified in his admirable
 Souvenirs.
ANIMAL INTELLIGENCE.
245
1881.]
Whilst reading this latter book, I speculated a little on the
subject Astonishing nonsense is often spoken of the sand
wasps knowledge of anatomy. Now will any one say that
the Gauchos on the plains of La Plata have such knowledge,
yet I have often seen them pith a struggling and lassoed cow
on the ground with unerring skill, which no mere anatomist
could imitate. The pointed knife was infallibly driven in
between the vertebrae by a single slight thrust I presume
that the art was first discovered by chance, and that each
young Gaucho sees exactly how the others do it, and then
with a very little practice learns the art Now I suppose that
the sand wasps originally merely killed their prey by stinging
them in many places (see p. 129 of Fabres * Souvenirs,
and p. 241) on the lower and softest side of the body  and
that to sting a certain segment was found by far the most
successful method ; and was inherited like the tendency of a
bulldog to pin the nose of a bull, or of a ferret to bite the
cerebellum. It would not be a very great step in advance to
prick the ganglion of its prey only slightly, and thus to give
its larvae fresh meat instead of old dried meat Though
Fabre insists so strongly on the unvarying character of
instinct yet it is shown that there is some variability, as at
p. 176, 177.
I fear that I shall have utterly wearied you with my
scribbling and bad handwriting.
My dear Romanes, yours very sincerely,
C. Darwin.

to myself your remarks on one point (I hope in some degree
correctly) in the following fashion :
Any character of an ancient, generalised, or intermediate
form may, and often does, re-appear in its descendants, after
countless generations, and this explains the extraordinarily
complicated affinities of existing groups. This idea seems
to me to throw a flood of light on the lines, sometimes used
to represent affinities, which radiate in all directions, often to
very distant sub-groups,  a difficulty which has haunted me
for half a century. A strong case could be made out in favour
of believing in such reversion after immense intervals of time.
I wish the idea had been put into my head in old days, for I
shall never again write on difficult subjects, as I have seen too
many cases of old men becoming feeble in their minds, without
being in the least conscious of it. If I have interpreted your
ideas at all correctly, I hope that you will re-urge, on any fitting
occasion, your view. I have mentioned it to a few persons
capable of judging, and it seemed quite new to them. I beg
you to forgive the proverbial garrulity of old age.

My Dear Hooker,  F or Heavens sake never speak of

ceedingly. I will go through your points seriatim, but I have

SIR JOSEPH HOOKERS ADDRESS.
247
l88l.]
Your idea, to show what travellers have done, seems to me
a brilliant and just one, especially considering your audience.
1. I know nothing about Toumeforts works.
2. I believe that you are fully right in calling Humboldt
the greatest scientific traveller who ever lived. I have lately
read two or three volumes again. His Geology is funny stuff ;
but that merely means that he was not in advance of his age.
I should say he was wonderful, more for his near approach to
omniscience than for originality. Whether or not his position
as a scientific man is as eminent as we think, you might truly
call him the parent of a grand progeny of scientific travellers,
who, taken together, have done much for science.
3. It seems to me quite just to give Lyell (and secondarily
E. Forbes) a very prominent place.
4 Dana was, I believe, the first man who maintained the
permanence of continents and the great oceans. . . . When I
read the 'Challengers' conclusion that sediment from the
land is not deposited at greater distances than 200 to 300
miles from the land, I was much strengthened in my old
belief. Wallace seems to me to have argued the case ex-
cellently. Nevertheless, I would speak, if I were in your place,
rather cautiously ; for T. Mellard Reade has argued lately
with some force against the view ; but I cannot call to mind his
arguments. If forced to express a judgment, I should abide
by the view of approximate permanence since Cambrian days.
5. The extreme importance of the Arctic fossil plants, is
self-evident Take the opportunity of groaning over [our]
ignorance of the Lignite Plants of Kerguelen Land, or any
Antarctic land. It might do good.
6. I cannot avoid feeling sceptical about the travelling of
plants from the North except during the Tertiary period. It
may of course have been so and probably was so from one
of the two poles at the earliest period, during Pre-Cambrian
ages; but such speculations seem to me hardly scientific,
seeing how little we know of the old Floras.
248 miscellanea  ( continued ). [1881.
I will now jot down without any order a few miscellaneous
remarks.
I think you ought to allude to Alph. De Candolles great
book, for though it (like almost everything else) is washed out
of my mind, yet I remember most distinctly thinking it a
very valuable work. Anyhow, you might allude to his
excellent account of the history of all cultivated plants.
How shall you manage to allude to your New Zealand and
Tierra del Fuego work ? if you do not allude to them you
will be scandalously unjust.
The many Angiosperm plants in the Cretacean beds of the
United States (and as far as I can judge the age of these
beds has been fairly well made out) seems to me a fact of
very great importance, so is their relation to the existing flora
of the United States under an Evolutionary point of view.
Have not some Australian extinct forms been lately found in
Australia ? or have I dreamed it ?
Again, the recent discovery of plants rather low down in
our Silurian beds is very important.
Nothing is more extraordinary in the history of the Vege-
table Kingdom, as it seems to me, than the apparently very
sudden or abrupt development of the higher plants. I have
sometimes speculated whether there did not exist somewhere
during long ages an extremely isolated continent, perhaps
near the South Pole.
Hence I was greatly interested by a view which Saporta
propounded to me, a few years ago, at great length in MS.
and which I fancy he has since published, as I urged him to
do  viz., that as soon as flower-frequenting insects were
developed, during the latter part of the secondary period, an
enormous impulse was given to the development of the higher
plants by cross-fertilization being thus suddenly formed.
A few years ago I was much struck with Axel Blytts*

navia, that there had apparently been long periods with more
rain and other with less rain (perhaps connected with Crolls
recurrent astronomical periods), and that these periods had
largely determined the present distribution of the plants of
Norway and Sweden. This seemed to me a very important
I have just read over my remarks and I fear that they will
not be of the slightest use to you.
I cannot but think that you have got through the hardest,
or at least the most difficult, part of your work in having made
so good and striking a sketch of what you intend to say ;
but I can quite understand how you must groan over the
great necessary labour.
I most heartily sympathise with you on the successes of
B. and R. : as years advance what happens to oneself
becomes of very little consequence, in comparison with the
careers of our children.
Keep your spirits up, for I am convinced that you will
make an excellent address.
Ever yours affectionately,
Charles Darwin.

you have said on Geology. I suppose that the classification
of the Silurian and Cambrian formations must be considered
the greatest or most important step ; for I well remember
when all these older rocks were called grau-wacke, and
nobody dreamed of classing them ; and now we have three
azoic formations pretty well made out beneath the Cambrian!
But the most striking step has been the discovery of the
Glacial period : you are too young to remember the pro-
digious effect this produced about the year 1840 (?) on all our
minds. Elie de Beaumont never believed in it to the day
of his death ! the study of the glacial deposits led to the
study of the superficial drift, which was formerly never
studied and called Diluvium, as I well remember. The study
under the microscope of rock-sections is another not incon-
siderable step. So again the making out of cleavage and the
foliation of the metamorphic rocks. But I will not run on,
having now eased my mind. Pray do not waste even one
minute in acknowledging my horrid scrawls.
Ever yours,

Aristotles merits, but I had not the most remote notion what
a wonderful man he was. Linnaeus and Cuvier have been
my two gods, though in very different ways, but they were

his ignorance on some points, as on muscles as the means of
movement I am glad that you have explained in so probable

Dear Sir,  A fter much deliberation, I have thought it
best to send your very interesting paper to the Zoological
Society, in hopes that it will be published in their Journal.
This journal goes to every scientific institution in the world,
and the contents are abstracted in all year-books on Zoology.
Therefore I have preferred it to Nature, though the latter has
a wider circulation, but is ephemeral.
1 have prefaced your essay by a few general remarks, to
which I hope that you will not object.
Of course I do not know that the Zoological Society, which
is much addicted to mere systematic work, will publish your
essay. If it does, I will send you copies of your essay, but
these will not be ready for some months. If not published
by the Zoological Society, I will endeavour to get  Nature to
publish it. I am very anxious that it should be published
and preserved. Dear Sir,
Yours faithfully,
C. Darwin.

CHAPTER VII.
FERTILISATION OF FLOWERS.
[In the letters already given we have had occasion to notice
the general bearing of a number of botanical problems on the
wider question of Evolution. The detailed work in botany
which my father accomplished by the guidance of the light
cast on the study of natural history by his own work on
CTTXTHR Evolution remains to be noticed. In a letter to Mr. Murray,
September 74th, 1861, speaking of his book on the Ferti-
lisation of Orchids, he says :  It will perhaps serve to
illustrate how Natural History may be worked under the
belief of the modification of species. This remark gives a
suggestion as to the value and interest of his botanical work,
and it might be expressed in far more emphatic language
without danger of exaggeration.
CTTXTHR In the same letter to Mr. Murray, he says :  I think this
little volume will do good to the ' Origin, as it will show that
I have worked hard at details. It is true that his botanical
work added a mass of corroborative detail to the case for
Evolution, but the chief support to his doctrines given by
these researches was of another kind. They supplied an
argument against those critics who have so freely dogmatised
as to the uselessness of particular structures, and as to the
consequent impossibility of their having been developed by
means of natural selection. His observations on Orchids
enabled him to say :  I can show the meaning of some of
the apparently meaningless ridges, horns ; who will now
FERTILISATION OF FLOWERS.
255
venture to say that this or that structure is useless?" A
kindred point is expressed in a letter to Sir J. D. Hooker
(May 14th, 1862) :
When many parts of structure, as in the woodpecker,
show distinct adaptation to external bodies, it is preposterous
to attribute them to the effects of climate, &a, but when a
single point alone, as a hooked seed, it is conceivable it may
thus have arisen. I have found the study of Orchids emi-
nently useful in showing me how nearly all parts of the flower
are co-adapted for fertilisation by insects, and therefore the
results of natural selection,  even the most trifling details of
structure.
One of the greatest services rendered by my father to the
study of Natural History is the revival of Teleology. The
evolutionist studies the purpose or meaning of organs with
the zeal of the older Teleology, but with far wider and more
coherent purpose. He has the invigorating knowledge that
he is gaining not isolated conceptions of the economy of the
present, but a coherent view of both past and present And
even where he fails to discover the use of any part, he may,
by a knowledge of its structure, unravel the history of the
past vicissitudes in the life of the species. In this way a
vigour and unity is given to the study of the forms of
organised beings, which before it lacked. This point has
already been discussed in Mr. Huxleys chapter on the
'Reception of the Origin of Species and need not be
here considered. It does, however, concern us to recognize
that this great service to natural science, as Dr. Gray
describes it, was effected almost as much by his special
botanical work as by the  Origin of Species.
For a statement of the scope and influence of my fathers
botanical work, I may refer to Mr. Thiselton Dyers article
in 1 Charles Darwin, one of the Nature Series. Mr. Dyers
wide knowledge, his friendship with my father, and especially
his power of sympathising with the work of others, combine
256
FERTILISATION
to give this essay a permanent value. The following passage
(p. 43) gives a true picture :
 Notwithstanding the extent and variety of his botanical
work, Mr. Darwin always disclaimed any right to be regarded
as a professed botanist. He turned his attention to plants,
doubtless because they were convenient objects for studying
organic phenomena in their least complicated forms ; and this
point of view, which, if one may use the expression without
disrespect, had something of the amateur about it, was in
itself of the greatest importance. For, from not being, till he
took up any point, familiar with the literature bearing on it,
his mind was absolutely free from any prepossession. He
was never afraid of his facts, or of framing any hypothesis,
however startling, which seemed to explain them. ... In any
one else such an attitude would have produced much work
that was crude and rash. But Mr. Darwin  if one may
venture on language which will strike no one who had con-
versed with him as over-strained  seemed by gentle persua-
sion to have penetrated that reserve of nature which baffles
smaller men. In other words, his long experience had given
him a kind of instinctive insight into the method of attack of
any biological problem, however unfamiliar to him, while he
rigidly controlled the fertility of his mind in hypothetical
explanations by the no less fertility of ingeniously devised
experiment
To form any just idea of the greatness of the revolution
worked by my fathers researches in the study of the fertilisa-
tion of flowers, it is necessary to know from what a condition
this branch of knowledge has emerged. It should be re-
membered that it was only during the early years of the
present century that the idea of sex, as applied to plants,
became firmly established. Sachs, in his  History of Botany
(1875), has given some striking illustrations of the remark-
able slowness with which its acceptance gained ground. He
remarks that when we consider the experimental proofs given

by Camerarius (1694)1 and by Kolreuter (1761-66), it appears
incredible that doubts should afterwards have been raised as
to the sexuality of plants. Yet he shows that such doubts
did actually repeatedly crop up. These adverse criticisms
rested for the most part on careless experiments, but in many
cases on d priori arguments. Even as late as 1820, a book of
this kind, which would now rank with circle squaring, or flat-
earth philosophy, was seriously noticed in a botanical journal.
A distinct conception of sex as applied to plants had not
long emerged from the mists of profitless discussion and
feeble experiment, at the time when my father began botany
by attending Henslows lectures at Cambridge.
When the belief in the sexuality of plants had become
established as an incontrovertible piece of knowledge, a
weight of misconception remained, weighing down any
rational view of the subject Camerarius * believed (naturally
enough in his day) that hermaphrodite flowers are necessarily
self-fertilised. He had the wit to be astonished at this, a
degree of intelligence which, as Sachs points out, the majority
of his successors did not attain to.
The following extracts from a note-book show that this,
point occurred to my father as early as 1837 :
"Do not plants which have male and female organs
together [i.e. in the same flower] yet receive influence from-
other plants ? Does not Lyell give some argument about
varieties being difficult to keep [true] on account of pollen
from other plants ? Because this may be applied to show all
plants do receive intermixture.
Sprengel,f indeed, understood that the hermaphrodite
structure of flowers by no means necessarily leads to self-
fertilisation. But although he discovered that in many cases
pollen is of necessity carried to the stigma of another flower ;
he did not understand that in the advantage gained by the

intercrossing of distinct plants lies the key to the whole
question. Hermann Muller has well remarked that this
omission was for several generations fatal to Sprengels
work For both at the time and subsequently, botanists
felt above all the weakness of his theory, and they set aside,
along with his defective ideas, his rich store of patient and
acute observations and his comprehensive and accurate inter-
pretations. It remained for my father to convince the world
that the meaning hidden in the structure of flowers was to
be found by seeking light in the same direction in which
Sprengel, seventy years before, had laboured. Robert Brown
was the connecting link between them ; for although, accord-
ing to Dr. Gray, * Brown, in common with the rest of the
world, looked on Sprengels ideas as fantastic, yet it was at
his recommendation that my father in 1841 read Sprengels
now celebrated Secret of Nature Displayed.! The book
impressed him as being  full of truth, although  with some
little nonsense. It not only encouraged him in kindred
speculation, but guided him in his work, for in 1844 he
speaks of verifying Sprengels observations. It may be
doubted whether Robert Brown ever planted a more fruitful
seed than in putting such a book into such hands.
A passage in the Autobiography (vol. i. p. 90) shows
how it was that my father was attracted to the subject of
fertilisation: During the summer of 1839, and I believe
during the previous summer, I was led to attend to the
cross-fertilisation of flowers by the aid of insects, from
having come to the conclusion in my speculations on the
origin of species, that crossing played an important part in
keeping specific forms constant.
The original connection between the study of flowers and
the problem of Evolution is curious, and could hardly have
been predicted. Moreover, it was not a permanent bond.

OF FLOWERS.
259
As soon as the idea arose that the offspring of cross-
fertilisation is, in the struggle for life, likely to conquer the
seedlings of self-fertilised parentage, a far more vigorous
belief in the potency of natural selection in moulding the
structure of flowers is attained. A central idea is gained
towards which experiment and observation may be directed.
Dr. Gray has well remarked with regard to this central idea
(Nature, June 4, 1874) :   The aphorism, 1 Nature abhors a
vacuum, is a characteristic specimen of the science of the
middle ages. The aphorism,  Nature abhors close fertilisa-
tion, and the demonstration of the principle, belong to our
age and to Mr. Darwin. To have originated this, and also
the principle of Natural Selection .... and to have applied
these principles to the system of nature, in such a manner as
to make, within a dozen years, a deeper impression upon
natural history than has been made since Linnaeus, is ample
title for one mans fame.
The flowers of the Fapilionaceae attracted his attention
early, and were the subject of his first paper on fertilisation.*
CTTXTHR The following extract from an undated letter to Dr. Asa
Gray seems to have been written before the publication of
this paper, probably in 1856 or 1857 :
. . . . What you say on Papilionaceous flowers is very
true ; and I have no facts to show that varieties are crossed ;
but yet (and the same remark is applicable in a beautiful way
to Fumaria and Dielytra, as I noticed many years ago), I
must believe that the flowers are constructed partly in direct
relation to the visits of insects ; and how insects can avoid
bringing pollen from other individuals I cannot understand.
It is really pretty to watch the action of a Humble-bee on
the scarlet kidney bean, and in this genus (and in Lathyrus

FERTILISATION
[1857-
grandiflorus) the honey is so placed that the bee invariably
alights on that one side of the flower towards which the spiral
pistil is protruded (bringing out with it pollen), and by the
depression of the wing-petal is forced against the bees side
all dusted with pollen.* In the broom the pistil is rubbed on
the centre of the back of the bee. I suspect there is some-
thing to be made out about the Leguminosre, which will
bring the case within our theory ; though I have failed to do
so. Our theory will explain why in the vegetable and ani-
mal kingdom the act of fertilisation even in hermaphrodites
usually takes place sub-jove, though thus exposed to great
injury from damp and rain. In animals which cannot
be [fertilised] by insects or wind, there is no case of land-
animals being hermaphrodite without the concourse of two
individuals.
A letter to Dr. Asa Gray (Sept 5th, 1857) gives the sub-
stance of the paper in the Gar denerd Chronicle :
 Lately I was led to examine buds of kidney bean with
the pollen shed ; but I was led to believe that the pollen could
hardly get on the stigma by wind or otherwise, except by
bees visiting [the flower] and moving the wing petals : hence
I included a small bunch of flowers in two bottles in every
way treated the same : the flowers in one I daily just
momentarily moved, as if by a bee ; these set three line
pods, the other not one. Of course this little experiment
must be tried again, and this year in England it is too late,
as the flowers seem now seldom to set. If bees are neces-
sary to this flowers self-fertilisation, bees must almost cross
them, as their dusted right-side of head and right legs
constantly touch the stigma.
 I have, also, lately been re-observing daily Lobelia fulgent

seeds, without pollen be put on the stigma (whereas the small
blue Lobelia is visited by bees and does set seed) ; I mention
this because there are such beautiful contrivances to prevent
the stigma ever getting its own pollen ; which seems only
explicable on the doctrine of the advantage of crosses.
The paper was supplemented by a second in 1858.* The
chief object of these publications seems to have been to
obtain information as to the possibility of growing varieties
of leguminous plants near each other, and yet keeping
them true. It is curious that the Papilionaceae should not
only have been the first flowers which attracted his attention
by their obvious adaptation to the visits of insects, but should
also have constituted one of his sorest puzzles. The common
pea and the sweet pea gave him much difficulty, because,
although they are as obviously fitted for insect-visits as the
rest of the order, yet their varieties keep true. The fact is
that neither of these plants being indigenous, they are not
perfectly adapted for fertilisation by British insects. He
could not, at this stage of his observations, know that the
co-ordination between a flower and the particular insect
which fertilises it may be as delicate as that between a lock
and its key, so that this explanation was not likely to occur
to him.f
Besides observing the Leguminosae, he had already begun,
as shown in the foregoing extracts, to attend to the structure
of other flowers in relation to insects. At the beginning of
i860 he worked at Leschenaultia,t which at first puzzled him,
* Gardeners' Chronicle , 1858,
p. 828. In 1861 another paper on
Fertilisation appeared in the Gar-
deners Chronicle, p. 552, in which
he explained the action of insects
on Vinca major. He was attracted
to the periwinkle by the fact that it
is not visited by insects and never
in the habits of insects. He pub-
lished a short note in the Entomo-
logists Weekly Intelligencer, i860,
asking whether the Tineina and
other small moths suck flowers.
t He published a short paper on
the manner of fertilisation of this
flower, in the Gardener t Chronicle,
1871, p. 1166.
He was of course alive to variety
262
FERTILISATION
[i860.
but was ultimately made out. A passage in a letter chiefly
relating to Leschenaultia seems to show that it was only in
the spring of i860 that he began widely to apply his know-
ledge to the relation of insects to other flowers. This is
somewhat surprising, when we remember that he had read
Sprengel many years before. He wrote (May 14) :
I should look at this curious contrivance as specially
related to visits of insects ; as I begin to think is almost
universally the case.
CTTXTHR Even in July 1862 he wrote to Dr. Asa Gray :
There is no end to the adaptations. Ought not these
cases to make one very cautious when one doubts about the
use of all parts? I fully believe that the structure of all
irregular flowers is governed in relation to insects. Insects
are the Lords of the floral (to quote the witty Athenaum)
world.
He was probably attracted to the study of Orchids by
the fact that several kinds are common near Down. The
letters of i860 show that these plants occupied a good deal of
his attention ; and in 1861 he gave part of the summer, and
all the autumn to the subject. He evidently considered
himself idle for wasting time on Orchids which ought to
have been given to ' Variation under Domestication. Thus
he wrote :
 There is to me incomparably more interest in observing
than in writing ; but I feel quite guilty in trespassing on
these subjects, and not sticking to varieties of the con-
founded cocks, hens and ducks. I hear that Lyell is savage
at me. I shall never resist Linum next summer.
It was in the summer of i860 that he made out one of the
most striking and familiar facts in the book, namely, the
manner in which the pollen masses in Orchis are adapted
for removal by insects. CTTXTHR He wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker
July 12:
 I have been examining Orchis fyramidalis, and it almost

equals, perhaps even beats, your Listera case; the sticky
glands are congenitally united into a saddle-shaped organ,
which has great power of movement, and seizes hold of
a bristle (or proboscis) in an admirable manner, and then
another movement takes place in the pollen masses, by
which they are beautifully adapted to leave pollen on the
two lateral stigmatic surfaces. I never saw anything so
beautiful.
In June of the same year he wrote :
"You speak of adaptation being rarely visible, though
present in plants. I have just recently been looking at the
common Orchis, and I declare I think its adaptations in every
part of the flower quite as beautiful and plain, or even more
beautiful than in the Woodpecker. I have written and sent a
notice for the Gardeners' Chronicle ,* on a curious difficulty in
the Bee Orchis, and should much like to hear what you think
of the case. In this article I have incidentally touched on
adaptation to visits of insects ; but the contrivance to keep
the sticky glands fresh and sticky beats almost everything in
nature. I never remember having seen it described, but it
must have been, and, as I ought not in my book to give
the observation as my own, I should be very glad to know
where this beautiful contrivance is described.
CTTXTHR He wrote also to Dr. Gray, June 8, i860 :
"Talking of adaptation, I have lately been looking at our
common orchids, and I dare say the facts are as old and well-
known as the hills, but I have been so struck with admiration
at the contrivances, that I have sent a notice to the Gardeners'
Chronicle. The Ophrys apifera, offers, as you will see, a curious
contradiction in structure.

already, in i860, busy with the homologies of the parts, a

subject of which he made good use in the Orchid book
CTTXTHR He wrote to Sir Joseph Hooker (July):
 It is a real good joke my discussing homologies of Orchids
with you, after examining only three or four genera ; and this
very fact makes me feel positive I am right ! ! I do not quite
understand some of your terms ; but sometime I must get
you to explain the homologies ; for I am intensely interested
on the subject, just as at a game of chess."
This work was valuable from a systematic point of view.
CTTXTHR In 1880 he wrote to Mr. Bentham :
"It was very kind in you to write to me about the
Orchideae, for it has pleased me to an extreme degree that 1
could have been of the least use to you about the nature of
the parts.
The pleasure which his early observations on Orchids gave
him is show in such extracts as the following from a letter
to Sir J. D. Hooker (July 27, 1861) :
You cannot conceive how the Orchids have delighted me.
They came safe, but box rather smashed ; cylindrical old
cocoa- or snuff-canister much safer. I enclose postage. As
an account of the movement, I shall allude to what I suppose
is Oncidium, to make certain,  is the enclosed flower with
crumpled petals this genus ? Also I most specially want to
know what the enclosed little globular brown Orchid is. I
have only seen pollen of a Cattleya on a bee, but surely have
you not unintentionally sent me what I wanted most (after
Catasetum or Mormodes), viz. one of the Epidendreae?! I
particularly want (and will presently tell you why) another
spike of this little Orchid, with older flowers, some even
almost withered.
His delight in observation is again shown in a letter to
CTTXTHR Dr. Gray (1863). Referring to Criigers letters from Trinidad,
he wrote :   Happy man, he has actually seen crowds of
bees flying round Catasetum, with the pollinia sticking to
their backs !"

CTTXTHR The following extracts of letters to Sir J. D. Hooker illus-
trate further the interest which his work excited in him :
"Veitch sent me a grand lot this morning. What wonderful

 I have now seen enough, and you must not send me more,
for though I enjoy looking at them much, and it has been
very useful to me, seeing so many different forms, it is
idleness. For my object each species requires studying for
days. I wish you had time to take up the group. I would
give a good deal to know what the rostellum is, of which I have
traced so many curious modifications. I suppose it cannot be
one of the stigmas,* there seems a great tendency for two
lateral stigmas to appear. My paper, though touching on
only subordinate points will run, I fear, to 100 MS. folio
pages ! The beauty of the adaptation of parts seems to me
unparalleled. I should think or guess waxy pollen was most
differentiated. In Cypripedium which seems least modified,
and a much exterminated group, the grains are single. In
all others, as far as I have seen, they are in packets of four ;
and these packets cohere into many wedge-formed masses in
Orchis ; into eight, four, and finally two. It seems curious
that a flower should exist, which could at most fertilise only
two other flowers, seeing how abundant pollen generally is ;
this fact I look at as explaining the perfection of the con-
trivance by which the pollen, so important from its fewness,
is carried from flower to flower (1861).
 I was thinking of writing to you to-day, when your note
with the Orchids came. What frightful trouble you have
taken about Vanilla ; you really must not take an atom
more ; for the Orchids are more play than real work. I have
been much interested by Epidendrum, and have worked all
morning at them ; for heavens sake, do not corrupt me by
any more (August 30, 1861).
 It is a modification of the upper stigma.
266
FERTILISATION
[1861.
He originally intended to publish his notes on Orchids
as a paper in the Linnean Societys Journal, but it soon
became evident that a separate volume would be a more
suitable form of publication. CTTXTHR In a letter to Sir J. D. Hooker,
Sept. 24, 1861, he writes :
 I have been acting, I fear that you will think, like a goose ;
and perhaps in truth I have. When I finished a few days
ago my Orchis paper, which turns out 140 folio pages ! ! and
thought of the expense of woodcuts, I said to myself, I will
offer the Linnean Society to withdraw it, and publish it in a
pamphlet. It then flashed on me that perhaps Murray would
publish it, so I gave him a cautious description, and offered
to share risks and profits. This morning he writes that he
will publish and take all risks, and share profits and pay for
all illustrations. It is a risk, and heaven knows whether it
will not be a dead failure, but I have not deceived Murray,
and [have] told him that it would interest those alone who
cared much for natural history. I hope I do not exaggerate
the curiosity of the many special contrivances.
CTTXTHR He wrote the two following letters to Mr. Murray about
the publication of the book :]
Down, Sept. 21 [1861].
My dear Sir,  Will you have the kindness to give me
your opinion, which I shall implicitly follow. I have just
finished a very long paper intended for Linnean Society
(the title is enclosed), and yesterday for the first time it
occurred to me that possibly it might be worth publishing
separately, which would save me trouble and delay. The
facts are new, and have been collected during twenty years
and strike me as curious. Like a Bridgewater treatise, the
chief object is to show the perfection of the many contrivances
in Orchids. The subject of propagation is interesting to
most people, and is treated in my paper so that any woman
could read it. Parts are dry and purely scientific; but I

think my paper would interest a good many of such persons
who care for Natural History, but no others.
... It would be a very little book, and I believe you think
very little books objectionable. I have myself great doubts
on the subject I am very apt to think that my geese are
swans ; but the subject seems to me curious and interesting.
I beg you not to be guided in the least in order to oblige
me, but as far as you can judge, please give me your opinion.
If I were to publish separately, I would agree to any terms,
such as half risk and half profit, or what you liked ; but I
would not publish on my sole risk, for to be frank, I have
been told that no publisher whatever, under such circum-
stances, cares for the success of a book.

My dear Sir,  I am very much obliged for your note and
very liberal offer. I have had some qualms and fears. All
that I can feel sure of is that the MS. contains many new and
curious facts, and I am sure the Essay would have interested
me, and will interest those who feel lively interest in the
wonders of nature ; but how far the public will care for such
minute details, I cannot at all tell. It is a bold experiment ;
and at worst, cannot entail much loss ; as a certain amount
of sale will, I think, be pretty certain. A large sale is out of
the question. As far as I can judge, generally the points
which interest me I find interest others; but I make the
experiment with fear and trembling,  not for my own sake,
but for yours. . . .
[CTTXTHR On Sept. 28th he wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker :
What a good soul you are not to sneer at me, but to pat
me on the back. I have the greatest doubt whether I am not
going to do, in publishing my paper, a most ridiculous thing.
268 FERTILISATION [l86l.
It would annoy me much, but only for Murrays sake, if the
publication were a dead failure.
There was still much work to be done, and in October he
was still receiving Orchids from Kew, and wrote to Hooker:
 It is impossible to thank you enough. I was almost mad
at the wealth of Orchids. And again
Mr. Veitch most generously has sent me two splendid
buds of Mormodes, which will be capital for dissection, but
I fear will never be irritable; so for the sake of charity
and love of heaven do, I beseech you, observe what move-
ment takes place in Cychnoches, and what part must be
touched. Mr. V. has also sent me one splendid flower of
Catasetum, the most wonderful Orchid I have seen.
CTTXTHR On Oct 13th he wrote to Sir Joseph Hooker :
It seems that I cannot exhaust your good nature I
have had the hardest days work at Catasetum and buds of
Mormodes, and believe I understand at last the mechanism of
movements and the functions. Catasetum is a beautiful case
of slight modification of structure leading to new functions. I
never was more interested in any subject in my life than in
this of Orchids. I owe very much to you.
Again to the same friend, Nov. I, 1861 :
 If you really can spare another Catasetum, when nearly
ready, I shall be most grateful ; had I not better send for it?

of the ' Fertilisation of Orchids, that he built himself a green-
house. CTTXTHR He wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker (Dec. 24th, 1862) :
 And now I am going to tell you a most important piece
of news ! ! I have almost resolved to build a small hot-house ;
my neighbours really first-rate gardener has suggested it,
and offered to make me plans, and see that it is well done,
and he is really a clever fellow, who wins lots of prizes, and
is very observant He believes that we should succeed with
a little patience ; it will be a grand amusement for me to
experiment with plants.
Again he wrote (Feb. 15 th, 1863) :
I write now because the new hot-house is ready, and I
long to stock it, just like a schoolboy. Could you tell me
pretty soon what plants you can give me ; and then I shall
know what to order? And do advise me how I had better
get such plants as you can spare. Would it do to send my
tax-cart early in the morning, on a day that was not frosty,
lining the cart with mats, and arriving here before night ?
I have no idea whether this degree of exposure (and of course
the cart would be cold) could injure stove-plants ; they would
be about five hours (with bait) on the journey home.
A week later he wrote :
You cannot imagine what pleasure your plants give
me (far more than your dead Wedgwood ware can give you) ;
H. and I go and gloat over them, but we privately confessed
to each other, that if they were not our own, perhaps we
should not see such transcendent beauty in each leaf.
And in March, when he was extremely unwell he wrote :
 A few words about the Stove-plants ; they do so amuse
me. I have crawled to see them two or three times. Will

he writes to Mr. Murray, June 13th and 18th :
 The Botanists praise my Orchid-book to the skies. Some
one sent me (perhaps you) the  Parthenon, with a good review.
The Athenceum * treats me with very kind pity and contempt ;
but the reviewer knew nothing of his subject.
 There is a superb, but I fear exaggerated, review in the

I was, to publish ; t for Asa Gray, about the most competent
judge in the world, thinks almost as highly of the book as
does the London Review. The AtheiuBum will hinder the

have warmed mine. It is not your approbation of my scien-
tific work (though I care for that more than for any ones) : it

sort of nervousness, and doubted whether I had not made an

the most trifling observations are worth publication.
Mr. Benthams approval was given in his Presidential
Address to the Linnean Society, May 24, 1862, and was
all the more valuable, because it came from one who was
by no means supposed to be favourable to Evolutionary
doctrines.]

Down, June 10 [1862].
My DEAR Gray,  Your generous sympathy makes you over-
estimate what you have read of my Orchid-book. But your
letter of May 18th and 26th has given me an almost foolish
amount of satisfaction. The subject interested me, I knew,
beyond its real value ; but I had lately got to think that I had
made myself a complete fool by publishing in a semi-popular

poor dear little man.  And now I must begin the  awfullys
on my own account : what a capital notice you have published
on the Orchids I It could not have been better ; but I fear that
you overrate it I am very sure that I had not the least
idea that you or any one would approve of it so much. I
return your last note for the chance of your publishing any
notice on the subject; but after all perhaps you may not
think it worth while ; yet in my judgment several of your
facts, especially Platanthera hyperborea , are much too good
to be merged in a review. But I have always noticed that
you are prodigal in originality in your reviews. . . .
[Sir Joseph Hooker reviewed the book in the Gardeners'
Chronicle, writing in a successful imitation of the style of
CTTXTHR Lindley, the Editor. My father wrote to Sir Joseph (Nov. 12,
1862) :
So you did write the review in the Gardeners' Chronicle.
Once or twice I doubted whether it was Lindley ; but when
I came to a little slap at R. Brown, I doubted no longer.
You arch-rogue ! I do not wonder you have deceived others
also. Perhaps I am a conceited dog; but if so, you have
much to answer for; I never received so much praise, and
coming from you I value it much more than from any other.
With regard to botanical opinion generally, he wrote to
Dr. Gray,  I am fairly astonished at the success of my book
with botanists. Among naturalists who were not botanists,
Lyell was pre-eminent in his appreciation of the book. I have
no means of knowing when he read it, but in later life, as
I learn from Professor Judd, he was enthusiastic in praise of
the 1 Fertilisation of Orchids, which he considered  next to
the Origin, as the most valuable of all Darwins works.
Among the general public the author did not at first hear
of many disciples, thus he wrote to his cousin Fox, in
September 1862 :  Hardly any one not a botapisf^^pept;

FERTILISATION
[1862.
A favourable notice appeared in the Saturday Review,
October 1 8th, 1 862 ; the reviewer points out that the book would
escape the angry polemics aroused by the  Origin. * This is
illustrated by a review in the Literary Churchman, in which
only one fault is found, namely, that Mr. Darwins expression
of admiration at the contrivances in orchids is too indirect a
way of saying,  O Lord, how manifold are Thy works I
A somewhat similar criticism occurs in the Edinburgh
Review  (October 1 862). The writer points out that Mr. Darwin
constantly uses phrases, such as beautiful contrivance, the
labellum is . . . in order to attract,  the nectar is purposely
lodged." The Reviewer concludes his discussion thus: We
know, too, that these purposes and ideas are not our own,
but the ideas and purposes of Another.
The  Edinburgh  reviewers treatment of his subject was
criticised in the Saturday Review, November 15th, 1862. With
reference to this article my father wrote to Sir Joseph Hooker
(December 29th, 1862) :
 Here is an odd chance ; my nephew Henry Parker, an
Oxford Classic, and Fellow of Oriel, came here this evening;
and I asked him whether he knew who had written the little
article in the Saturday, smashing the [Edinburgh reviewer],
which we liked ; and after a little hesitation he owned he
had. I never knew that he wrote in the Saturday ; and was
it not an odd chance ?
The  Edinburgh  article was written by the Duke of
Argyll, and has since been made use of in his * Reign of Law,
1867. Mr. Wallace replied f to the Dukes criticisms, making
some especially good remarks on those which refer to orchids.
He shows how, by a  beautiful self-acting adjustment, the

length), and the proboscis of a moth sufficiently long to reach
the nectar, might be developed by natural selection. He goes
on to point out that on any other theory we must suppose
that the flower was created with an enormously long nectary,
and that then by a special act, an insect was created fitted to
visit the flower, which would otherwise remain sterile. With re-
gard to this point my father wrote (October 12 or 13, 1867) :
 I forgot to remark how capitally you turn the tables on
the Duke, when you make him create the Angraecum and
Moth by special creation.
If we examine the literature relating to the fertilisation of
flowers, we do not find that this new branch of study showed
any great activity immediately after the publication of the
Orchid-book. There are a few papers by Asa Gray, in 1862
and 1863, by Hildebrand in 1864, and by Moggridge in 1865,
but the great mass of work by Axell, Delpino, Hildebrand,
and the Mullers, did not begin to appear until about 1867.
The period during which the new views were being assimi-
lated, and before they became thoroughly fruitful, was, how-
ever, surprisingly short. The later activity in this depart-
ment may be roughly gauged by the fact that the valuable
'Bibliography, given by Prof. DArcy Thompson in his
translation of Mullers * Befruchtung  (1883), contains refer-
ences to 814 papers.
Besides the book on Orchids, my father wrote two or three
papers on the subject, which will be found mentioned in the
Appendix. The earliest of these, on the three sexual forms
of Catasetum, was published in 1862 ; it is an anticipation
of part of the Orchid-book, and was merely published in the
Linncan Societys Journal, in acknowledgment of the use
made of a specimen in the Societys possession. The possi-
bility of apparently distinct species being merely sexual forms
of a single species, suggested a characteristic experiment,
which is alluded to in the following letter to one of his earliest
disciples in the study of the fertilisation of flowers :]

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to J. Traherne Moggridge .*
Down, October 13 [1865J.
My DEAR Sir,  I am especially obliged to you for your
beautiful plates and letter-press ; for no single point in natural
history interests and perplexes me so much as the self-fertili-
sation t of the Bee-orchis. You have already thrown some
light on the subject, and your present observations promise
to throw more.
I formed two conjectures : first, that some insect during
certain seasons might cross the plants, but I have almost
given up this ; nevertheless, pray have a look at the flowers
next season. Secondly, I conjectured that the Spider and
Bee-orchids might be a crossing and self-fertile form of the
same species. Accordingly I wrote some years ago to an
acquaintance, asking him to mark some Spider-orchids, and
observe whether they retained the same character ; but he
evidently thought the request as foolish as if I had asked him
to mark one of his cows with a ribbon, to see if it would turn
next spring into a horse. Now will you be so kind as to tie
a string round the stem of half-a-dozen Spider-orchids, and
when you leave Mentone dig them up, and I would try and
cultivate them and see if they kept constant ; but I should re-
quire to know in what sort of soil and situations they grow. It
would be indispensable to mark the plant so that there could be
no mistake about the individual. It is also just possible that
the same plant would throw up, at different seasons different
flower-scapes, and the marked plants would serve as evidence.
With many thanks, my dear sir,
Yours sincerely,
C. Darwin.

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to T. H. Farrer.
Down, Sept 15, 1868.
My dear Mr. Farrer,  I grieve to say that the main
features of your case are known. I am the sinner and de-
scribed them some ten years ago. But I overlooked many
details, as the appendage to the single stamen, and several
other points. I send my notes, but I must beg for their
return, as I have no other copy. I quite agree, the facts are
most striking, especially as you put them. Are you sure that
the Hive-bee is the cutter t it is against my experience.
If sure, make the point more prominent, or if not sure, erase
it I do not think the subject is quite new enough for the
Linnean Society ; but I dare say the * Annals and Magazine
of Natural History, or Gardeners' Chronicle would gladly
publish your observations, and it is a great pity they should
be lost If you like I would send your paper to either
quarter with a note. In this case you must give a title,
and your name, and perhaps it would be well to premise
your remarks with a line of reference to my paper stating
that you had observed independently and more fully.
I have read my own paper over after an interval of several
years, and am amused at the caution with which I put the
case that the final end was for crossing distinct individuals, of
which I was then as fully convinced as now, but I knew that
the doctrine would shock all botanists. Now the opinion is
becoming familiar.

FERTILISATION

To see penetration of pollen-tubes is not difficult, but in
most cases requires some practice with dissecting under a
one-tenth of an inch focal distance single lens ; and just at
first this will seem to you extremely difficult.

has been sacrificed, or partly sacrificed, to Public life.
Believe me, yours very sincerely,

P.S.  If you come across any large Salvia, look at it the
contrivance is admirable. It went to my heart to tell a man
who came here a few weeks ago with splendid drawings and
MS. on Salvia, that the work had been all done in Germany.*
[The following extract is from a letter, November 26th, 1868,
to Sir Thomas Farrer, written as I learn from him,  in answer
to a request for some advice as to the best modes of ob-
servation.
 In my opinion the best plan is to go on working and
making copious notes, without much thought of publication,
and then if the results turn out striking publish them. It
is my impression, but I do not feel sure that I am right,
that the best and most novel plan would be, instead of de-
scribing the means of fertilisation in particular plants, to
investigate the part which certain structures play with all
plants or throughout certain orders ; for instance, the brush
of hairs on the style, or the diadelphous condition of the
stamens in the Leguminosse, or the hairs within the corolla,
&c. &c. Looking to your note, I think that this is perhaps
the plan which you suggest.
It is well to remember that Naturalists value observations

fir more than reasoning ; therefore your conclusions should
be as often as possible fortified by noticing how insects actu-
ally do the work.
In 1869, Sir Thomas Farrer corresponded with my father
on the fertilisation of Passiflora and of Tacsonia. He has
given me his impressions of the correspondence :
" I had suggested that the elaborate series of chevaux-de-
frise, by which the nectary of the common Passiflora is
guarded, were specially calculated to protect the flower from
the stiff-beaked humming birds which would not fertilize it,
and to facilitate the access of the little proboscis of the
humble bee, which would do so ; whilst, on the other hand, the
long pendent tube and flexible valve-like corona which retains
the nectar of Tacsonia would shut out the bee, which would
not, and admit the humming bird which would, fertilize that
(lower. The suggestion is very possibly worthless, and could
only be verified or refuted by examination of flowers in the
countries where they grow naturally. . . . What interested
me was to see that on this as on almost any other point of
detailed observation, Mr. Darwin could always say, Yes;
but at one time I made some observations myself on this
particular point ; and I think you will find, &c. &c. That
he should after years of interval remember that he had
noticed the peculiar structure to which I was referring in the
Passiflora princeps struck me at the time as very remark-
able.
With regard to the spread of a belief in the adaptation of
(lowers for cross -fertilisation, my father wrote to Mr. Bentham
April 22, 1868 :
 Most of the criticisms which I sometimes meet with in
French works against the frequency of crossing, I am certain
are the result of mere ignorance. I have never hitherto
found the rule to fail that when an author describes the
structure of a flower as specially adapted for self-fertilisation,
it is really adapted for crossing. The Fumariaceae offer a
280

good instance of this, and Treviranus threw this order in my
teeth ; but in Corydalis, Hildebrand shows how utterly false
the idea of self-fertilisation is. This authors paper on Salvia
is really worth reading, and I have observed some species,
and know that he is accurate."
CTTXTHR The next letter refers to Professor Hildebrands paper on
Corydalis, published in the Proc. Internat. Hort. Congress,
London, 1866, and in Pringsheims  Jahrbiicher, vol. v. The
memoir on Salvia alluded to is contained in the previous
volume of the same Journal :]

Down, May 16 [1866].
My DEAR Sir,  T he state of my health prevents my attend-
ing the Hort. Congress ; but I forwarded yesterday your paper
to the secretary, and if they are not overwhelmed with papers,
yours will be gladly received. I have made many observa-
tions on the Fumariaceae, and convinced myself that they were
adapted for insect agency ; but I never observed anything
nearly so curious as your most interesting facts. I hope you
will repeat your experiments on the Corydalis on a larger
scale, and especially on several distinct plants ; for your
plant might have been individually peculiar, like certain indi-
vidual plants of Lobelia, 8rc., described by Gartner, and of
Passiflora and Orchids described by Mr. Scott. . . .
Since writing to you before, I have read your admirable
memoir on Salvia, and it has interested me almost as much as
when I first investigated the structure of Orchids. Your
paper illustrates several points in my Origin of Species,
especially the transition of organs. Knowing only two or
three species in the genus, I had often marvelled how one
cell of the anther could have been transformed into the mov-
able plate or spoon ; and how well you show the gradations ;

but I am surprised that you did not more strongly insist on
this point
I shall be still more surprised if you do not ultimately
come to the same belief with me, as shown by so many beau-

cause, to be occasionally fertilized by pollen from a distinct
individual. With sincere respect, believe me, my dear Sir,

My DEAR Sir,  Owing to all sorts of interruptions and to
my reading German so slowly, I have read only to p. 88 of

very valuable a work it appears to me. Independently of the
many original observations, which of course form the most
important part, the work will be of the highest use as a means
of reference to all that has been done on the subject I am
fairly astonished at the number of species of insects, the visits
of which to different flowers you have recorded. You must
have worked in the most indefatigable manner. About half a
year ago the editor of 1 Nature suggested that it would be a
grand undertaking if a number of naturalists were to do what
you have already done on so large a scale with respect to the
visits of insects. I have been particularly glad to read your
historical sketch, for I had never before seen all the references

when I said that C. K. Sprengel did not fully perceive that
cross-fertilisation was the final end of the structure of flowers ;
but now this fear is relieved, and it is a great satisfaction to
me to believe that I have aided in making his excellent book
more generally known. Nothing has surprised me more
than to see in your historical sketch how much I myself have
done on the subject, as it never before occurred to me to
think of all my papers as a whole. But I do not doubt that
your generous appreciation of the labours of others has led
you to over-estimate what I have done. With very sincere

.... I was much interested by your brother's article on
Hedychium ; about two years ago I was so convinced that
the flowers were fertilized by the tips of the wings of large
moths, that I wrote to India to ask a man to observe the
flowers and catch the moths at work, and he sent me 20 to
30 Sphinx-moths, but so badly packed that they all arrived in
fragments ; and I could make out nothing. . . .

though so overworked, often writes to me.
 I have had one letter which has interested me greatly,
with a paper, which will appear in the Linnean Journal, by
Dr. Criiger of Trinidad, which shows that I am all right about
Catasetum, even to the spot where the pollinia adhere to the
bees, which visit the flower, as I said, to gnaw the labellum.
Criigers account of Coryanthes and the use of the bucket-like
labellum full of water beats everything : I suspect that the
bees being well wetted flattens their hairs, and allows the
viscid disc to adhere.]

affect me very little, and I can say with entire truth that your
kind expression of sympathy has given and will give me
much more pleasure than the election itself, should I be
elected.
Your idea that dicotyledonous plants were not developed
in force until sucking insects had been evolved seems to me a
splendid one. I am surprised that the idea never occurred
to me, but, this is always the case when one first hears a new
and simple explanation of some mysterious phenomenon ....
I formerly showed that we might fairly assume that the
beauty of flowers, their sweet odour and copious nectar, may
be attributed to the existence of flower-haunting insects, but
your idea, which I hope you will publish, goes much further
and is much more important With respect to the great
development of mammifers in the later Geological periods
following from the development of dicotyledons, I think it
ought to be proved that such animals as deer, cows, horses,
&c. could not flourish if fed exclusively on the gramineae and
other anemophilous monocotyledons ; and I do not suppose
that any evidence on this head exists.
Your suggestion of studying the manner of fertilisation of
the surviving members of the most ancient forms of the
dicotyledons is a very good one, and I hope that you will
keep it in mind yourself, for I have turned my attention to
other subjects. Delpino I think says that Magnolia is fertil-
ised by insects which gnaw the petals, and I should not be
surprised if the same fact holds good with Nymphma.
Whenever I have looked at the flowers of these latter plants
I have felt inclined to admit the view that petals are modified
stamens, and not modified leaves ; though Poinsettia seems
to show that true leaves might be converted into coloured
petals. I grieve to say that I have never been properly
grounded in Botany and have studied only special points
therefore I cannot pretend to express any opinion on your
remarks on the origin of the flowers of the Conifer��, Gneta-

ceae, &c ; but I have been delighted with what you say on the
conversion of a monoecious species into a hermaphrodite one
by the condensations of the verticils on a branch bearing
female flowers near the summit, and male flowers below.
I expect Hooker to come here before long, and I will then
show him your drawing, and if he makes any important re-
marks I will communicate with you. He is very busy at
present in clearing off arrears after his American Expedition,
so that I do not like to trouble him, even with the briefest
note. I am at present working with my son at some Physio-
logical subjects, and we are arriving at very curious results,
but they are not as yet sufficiently certain to be worth com-
municating to you. . . .
[In 1 877 a second edition of the * Fertilisation of Orchids was
published, the first edition having been for some time out of

author owed to his friend Fritz Muller.

[One of the latest references to his Orchid-work occurs in
a letter to Mr. Bentham, February 16, 1880. It shows the
amount of pleasure which this subject gave to my father, and
(what is characteristic of him) that his reminiscence of the
work was one of delight in the observations which preceded
its publication, not to the applause which followed it :
 They are wonderful creatures, these Orchids, and I some-
times think with a glow of pleasure, when I remember making
out some little point in their method of fertilisation.]

CHAPTER VIII.
THE EFFECTS OF CROSS- AND SELF-FERTILISATION
IN THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM. 1 876.
[This book, as pointed out in the Autobiography, is a
complement to the  Fertilisation of Orchids, because it shows
how important are the results of cross-fertilisation which are
ensured by the mechanisms described in that book. By
proving that the offspring of cross-fertilisation are more
vigorous than the offspring of self-fertilisation, he showed that
one circumstance which influences the fate of young plants in
the struggle for life is the degree to which their parents are
fitted for cross-fertilisation. He thus convinced himself that
the intensity of the struggle (which he had elsewhere shown
to exist among young plants) is a measure of the strength
of a selective agency perpetually sifting out every modification
in the structure of flowers which can affect its capabilities
for cross-fertilisation.
The book is also valuable in another respect, because it
throws light on the difficult problems of the origin of sexuality.
The increased vigour resulting from cross-fertilisation is allied
in the closest manner to the advantage gained by change
of conditions. So strongly is this the case, that in some
instances cross-fertilisation gives no advantage to the off-
spring, unless the parents have lived under slightly different
conditions. So that the really important thing is not that two
individuals of different blood shall unite, but two individuals

2gO THE EFFECTS OF CROSS- [1866?
which have been subjected to different conditions. We are
thus led to believe that sexuality is a means for infusing
vigour into the offspring by the coalescence of differentiated
elements, an advantage which could not follow if reproductions
were entirely asexual.
It is remarkable that this book, the result of eleven years
of experimental work, owed its origin to a chance observation.
My father had raised two beds of Linaria vulgaris one set
being the offspring of cross- and the other of self-fertilisation.
These plants were grown for the sake of some observations
on inheritance, and not with any view to cross-breeding, and he
was astonished to observe that the offspring of self-fertilisa-
tion were clearly less vigorous than the others. It seemed
incredible to him that this result could be due to a single act
of self-fertilisation, and it was only in the following year,
when precisely the same result occurred in the case of a
similar experiment on inheritance in Carnations, that his
attention was  thoroughly aroused, and that he determined
to make a series of experiments specially directed to the
question. The following letters give some account of the
work in question :]
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to Asa Gray.
September to, [1866!]
.... I have just begun a large course of experiments on
the germination of the seed, and on the growth of the young
plants when raised from a pistil fertilised by pollen from the
same flower, and from pollen from a distinct plant of the
same, or of some other variety. I have not made sufficient
experiments to judge certainly, but in some cases the differ-
ence in the growth of the young plants is highly remarkable.
I have taken every kind of precaution in getting seed from the
same plant, in germinating the seed on my own chimney-
piece, in planting the seedlings in the same flower-pot, and
under this similar treatment I have seen the young seedlings

from the crossed seed exactly twice as tall as the seedlings
from the self-fertilised seed ; both seeds having germinated
on same day. If I can establish this fact (but perhaps it will
all go to the dogs), in some fifty cases, with plants of different
orders, I think it will be very important, for then we shall
positively know why the structure of every flower permits, or
favours, or necessitates an occasional cross with a distinct
individual. But all this is rather cooking my hare before I
have caught it. But somehow it is a great pleasure to me to
tell you what I am about
Believe me, my dear Gray,
Ever yours most truly, and with cordial thanks,
C. Darwin.
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to G. Bentham.

.... I am experimenting on a very large scale on the
difference in power of growth between plants raised from
self-fertilised and crossed seeds ; and it is no exaggeration to
say that the difference in growth and vigour is sometimes
truly wonderful. Lyell, Huxley and Hooker have seen
some of my plants, and been astonished ; and I should much
like to show them to you. I always supposed until lately
that no evil effects would be visible until after several genera-
tions of self-fertilisation ; but now I see that one generation
sometimes suffices ; and the existence of dimorphic plants
and all the wonderful contrivances of orchids are quite
intelligible to me.
With cordial thanks for your letter, which has pleased me

I should be very well contented to deserve a fraction of your

than mere pleasure, by your argument about the separation
of the sexes. I dare say that I am wrong, and will hereafter
consider what you say more carefully : but at present I can-
not drive out of my head that the sexes must have originated
from two individuals, slightly different, which conjugated.
But I am aware that some cases of conjugation are opposed
to any such views.

CHAPTER IX.
DIFFERENT FORMS OF FLOWERS ON PLANTS OF THE
SAME SPECIES. 1 877.
[The volume bearing the above title was published in 1877,
and was dedicated by the author to Professor Asa Gray,  as
a small tribute of respect and affection. It consists of
certain earlier papers re-edited, with the addition of a
quantity of new matter. The subjects treated in the book
(i.) Heterostyled Plants.
(ii.) Polygamous, Dicecious, and Gynodicecious Plants.
(iii.) Cleistogamic Flowers.
The nature of heterostyled plants may be illustrated in the
primrose, one of the best known examples of the class. If a
number of primroses be gathered, it will be found that some
plants yield nothing but  pin-eyed  flowers, in which the
style (or organ for the transmission of the pollen to the ovule)
is long, while the others yield only  thrum-eyed  flowers with
short styles. Thus primroses are divided into two sets or
castes differing structurally from each other. My father
showed that they also differ sexually, and that in fact the bond
between the two castes more nearly resembles that between
separate sexes than any other known relationship. Thus for
example a long-styled primrose, though it can be fertilised by
its own pollen, is not fully fertile unless it is impregnated by
the pollen of a short-styled flower. Heterostyled plants are
comparable to hermaphrodite animals, such as snails, which
require the concourse of two individuals, although each pos-
2 96 DIFFERENT FORMS OF FLOWERS
sesses both the sexual elements. The difference is that in
the case of the primrose it is perfect fertility, and not simply
fertility, that depends on the mutual action of the two sets of
individuals.
The work on heterostyled plants has a special bearing, to
which the author attached much importance, on the problem
of origin of species.*
He found that a wonderfully close parallelism exists
between hybridisation and certain forms of fertilisation
among heterostyled plants. So that it is hardly an exag-
geration to say that the  illegitimately  reared seedlings are
hybrids, although both their parents belong to identically the
same species. CTTXTHR In a letter to Professor Huxley, given in the
second volume (p. 384), my father writes as if his researches
on heterostyled plants tended to make him believe that
sterility is a selected or acquired quality. But in his later
publications, eg. in the sixth edition of the Origin, he
adheres to the belief that sterility is an incidental rather than
a selected quality. The result of his work on heterostyled
plants is of importance as showing that sterility is no test
of specific distinctness, and that it depends on differentiation
of the sexual elements which is independent of any racial
difference. I imagine that it was his instinctive love of
making out a difficulty which to a great extent kept him
at work so patiently on the heterostyled plants. But it
was the fact that general conclusions of the above character
could be drawn from his results which made him think his
results worthy of publication.!
The papers which on this subject preceded and contributed
to  Forms of Flowers  were the following :
 On the two Forms or Dimorphic Condition in the Species
of Primula, and on their remarkable Sexual Relations." Linn.
Soc. Journal, 1862.

The following letter shows that he began the work on
heterostyled plants with an erroneous view as to the meaning
of the facts.]
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to J. D. Hooker.
Down, May 7 [i860].
.... I have this morning been looking at my experi-
mental cowslips, and I find some plants have all flowers with
long stamens and short pistils, which I will call  male plants,
others with short stamens and long pistils, which I will call
"female plants. This I have somewhere seen noticed, I
think by Henslow ; but I find (after looking at my two sets
of [plants) that the stigmas of the male and female are of
slightly different shape, and certainly different degree of
roughness, and what has astonished me, the pollen of the
so-called female plant, though very abundant, is more trans-
parent, and each granule is exactly only �� of the size of the
pollen of the so-called male plants. Has this been observed ?
I cannot help suspecting [that] the cowslip is in fact dioecious,
but it may turn out all a blunder, but anyhow I will mark with
sticks the so-called male and female plants and watch their

seeding. It would be a fine case of gradation between an
hermaphrodite and unisexual condition. Likewise a sort of
case of balancement of long and short pistils and stamens.
Likewise perhaps throws light on oxlips. ... ii
I have now examined primroses and find exactly the same
difference in the size of the pollen, correlated with the same
difference in the length of the style and roughness of the
stigmas.
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to Asa Gray.
June 8 [i860].
.... I have been making some little trifling observations
which have interested and perplexed me much. I find with
primroses and cowslips, that about an equal number of plants
are thus characterised.
So-called (by me) male plant Pistil much shorter than
stamens ; stigma rather smooth, pollen grains large, throat
of corolla short.
So-called female plant. Pistil much longer than stamens,
stigma rougher , pollen-grains smaller,  throat of corolla long.
I have marked a lot of plants, and expected to find the so-
called male plant barren ; but judging from the feel of the
capsules, this is not the case, and I am very much surprised at
the difference in the size of the pollen. ... If it should
prove that the so-called male plants produce less seed than
the so-called females, what a beautiful case of gradation from
hermaphrodite to unisexual condition it will be ! If they pro-
duce about equal number of seed, how perplexing it will be.
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to J. D. Hooker.

.... In the spring I must get you to look for long pistils and
short pistils in the rarer species of Primula and in some allied
Genera. It holds with P. Sinensis. You remember all the
fuss I made on this subject last spring ; well, the other day
at last I had time to weigh the seeds, and by Jove the plants
of primrose and cowslip with short pistils and large grained
pollen * are rather more fertile than those with long pistils,
and small-grained pollen. I find that they require the action
of insects to set them, and I never will believe that these
differences are without some meaning.
Some of my experiments lead me to suspect that the large-
grained pollen suits the long pistils and the small-grained
pollen suits the short pistils ; but I am determined to see if I
cannot make out the mystery next spring.

To Dr. Gray he wrote, (Dec. 1861) :
 You may rely on it, I will send you a copy of my Primula
paper as soon as I can get one ; but I believe it will not be
printed till April 1st, and therefore after my Orchid Book. I
care more for your and Hookers opinion than for that of all
the rest of the world, and for Lyells on geological points.
Bentham and Hooker thought well of my paper when read ;
but no one can judge of evidence by merely hearing a
paper.
The work on Primula was the means of bringing my
father in contact with the late Mr. John Scott, then working
as a gardener in the Botanic Gardens at Edinburgh, an
employment which he seems to have chosen in order to
gratify his passion for natural history. He wrote one or two
excellent botanical papers, and ultimately obtained a post in
India.* He died in 1880.
A few phrases may be quoted from letters to Sir J. D.
Hooker, showing my fathers estimate of Scott :
If you know, do please tell me who is John Scott of the
Botanical Gardens of Edinburgh ; I have been corresponding
largely with him ; he is no common man.
 If he had leisure he would make a wonderful observer; to
my judgment I have come across no one like him.
 He has interested me strangely, and I have formed a very
high opinion of his intellect I hope he will accept pecuniary
assistance from me ; but he has hitherto refused. (He
ultimately succeeded in being allowed to pay for Mr. Scotts
passage to India.)
 I know nothing of him excepting from his letters ; these
show remarkable talent, astonishing perseverance, much
modesty, and what I admire, determined difference from me
on many points.

discussion) of employing him to work out certain problems
connected with intercrossing.
The following letter refers to my fathers investigations

condition of sexual complexity than that of Primula. For
in Lythrum there are not merely two, but three castes,

I have castrated and fertilised above ninety flowers, trying all
the eighteen distinct crosses which are possible within the
limits of this one species ! I cannot explain, but I feel sure
you would think it a grand case. I have been writing to
Botanists to see if I can possibly get L. hyssopifolia, and it has

P.S.  There is reason in my madness, for I can see that to
those who already believe in change of species, these facts
will modify to a certain extent the whole view of Hybridity.*
[CTTXTHR On the same subject he wrote to Sir Joseph Hooker in
August 1862 :
Is Oliver at Kew? When I am established at Bourne-
mouth I am completely mad to examine any fresh flowers of
any Lythraceous plant, and I would write and ask him if any
are in bloom.
Again he wrote to the same friend in October :
 If you ask Oliver, I think he will tell you I have got a
real odd case in Lythrum, it interests me extremely, and
seems to me the strangest case of propagation recorded
amongst plants or animals, viz. a necessary triple alliance
between three hermaphrodites. I feel sure I can now prove
the truth of the case from a multitude of crosses made this
summer.
* A letter to Dr." Gray (July,
1862) bears on this point :  A few
days ago I made an observation
which has surprised me more than
it ought to do it will have to be
repeated several times, but I have
scarcely a doubt of its accuracy. I
stated in my Primula paper that
the long-styled form of Linum
grandijlorum was utterly sterile
with its own pollen ; I have lately
been putting the pollen of the two
forms on the division of the stigma
of the same flower ; and it strikes
me as truly wonderful, that the
stigma distinguishes the pollen;
and is penetrated by the tubes of
the one and not by those of the
other ; nor are the tubes exserted.
Or (which is the same thing) the
stigma of the one form acts on and
is acted on by pollen, which produces
not the least effect on the stigma of
the other form. Taking sexual
power as the criterion of difference,
the two forms of this one species
may be said to be generically
distinct.
1862.] ON PLANTS OF THE SAME SPECIES. 303
In an article, Dimorphism in the Genitalia of Plants
( Sillimans Journal, 1862, vol. xxxiv. p. 419), Dr. Gray points
out that the structural difference between the two forms of
Primula had already been defined in the  Flora of N. America,
as dicecio-dimorphism. The use of this term called forth the
following remarks from my father. The letter also alludes
to a review of the  Fertilisation of Orchids  in the same
volume of  Sillimans Journal.]
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to Asa Gray.
Down, November 26 [1862].
My dear Gray,  The very day after my last letter,
yours of November 10th, and the review in Silliman, which
I feared might have been lost, reached me. We were all very
much interested by the political part of your letter ; and in
some odd way one never feels that information and opinions
printed in a newspaper come from a living source ; they seem
dead, whereas all that you write is full of life. The reviews
interested me profoundly; you rashly ask for my opinion,
and you must consequently endure a long letter. First for
Dimorphism ; I do not at present like the term  Dicecio-
dimorphism ; for I think it gives quite a false notion, that
the phenomena are connected with a separation of the sexes.
Certainly in Primula there is unequal fertility in the two
forms, and I suspect this is the case with Linum; and,
therefore, I felt bound in the Primula paper to state that it
might be a step towards a dioecious condition; though I
believe there are no dioecious forms in Primulaceae or Linacem.
But the three forms in Lythrum convince me that the
phenomenon is in no way necessarily connected with any
tendency to separation of sexes. The case seems to me in
result or function to be almost identical with what old
C. K. Sprengel called dichogamy, and which is so frequent
in truly hermaphrodite groups ; namely, the pollen and stigma
304
 DIFFERENT FORMS OF FLOWERS [1862.
of each flower being mature at different periods. If I am right,
it is very advisable not to use the term  dioecious, as this
at once brings notions of separation of sexes.
... I was much perplexed by Olivers remarks in the
 Natural History Review  on the Primula case, on the lower
plants having sexes more often of the separated than in the
higher plants,  so exactly the reverse of what takes place
in animals. Hooker in his review of the Orchids repeats
this remark. There seems to be much truth in what you
say,* and it did not occur to me, about no improbability of
specialisation in certain lines in lowly organised beings. I
could hardly doubt that the hermaphrodite state is the
aboriginal one. But how is it in the conjugation of Con-
fervae  is not one of the two individuals here in fact male,
and the other female? I have been much puzzled by this
contrast in sexual arrangements between plants and animals.
Can there be anything in the following consideration : By
roughest calculation about one-third of the British genera of
aquatic plants belong to the Linnean classes of Mono and
Dicecia ; whilst of terrestrial plants (the aquatic genera being
subtracted) only one-thirteenth of the genera belong to these
two classes. Is there any truth in this fact generally ? Can
aquatic plants, being confined to a small area or small com-
munity of individuals, require more free crossing, and there-
fore have separate sexes ? But to return to one point, does
not Alph. de Candolle say that aquatic plants taken as a
whole are lowly organised, compared with terrestrial ; and
may not Olivers remark on the separation of the sexes in
lowly organised plants stand in some relation to their being
frequently aquatic ? Or is this all rubbish ?
.... What a magnificent compliment you end your review
with 1 You and Hooker seem determined to turn my head

.... You will think that I am in the most unpleasant, con-
tradictory, fractious humour, when I tell you that I do not like
your term of  precocious fertilisation  for your second class
of dimorphism \i.e. for cleistogamic fertilisation]. If I can
trust my memory, the state of the corolla, of the stigma, and
the pollen-grains is different from the state of the parts in the
bud ; that they are in a condition of special modification.
But upon my life I am ashamed of myself to differ so much
from my betters on this head. The temporary theory* which
I have formed on this class of dimorphism, just to guide
experiment, is that the perfect flowers can only be perfectly

fertilised by insects, and are in this case abundantly crossed ;
but that the flowers are not always, especially in early spring,
visited enough by insects, and therefore the little imperfect
self-fertilising flowers are developed to ensure a sufficiency of
seed for present generations. Viola canina is sterile, when
not visited by insects, but when so visited forms plenty of
seed. I infer from the structure of three or four forms of Bal-
saminea, that these require insects ; at least there is almost
as plain adaptation to insects as in Orchids. I have Oxalis
acetosella ready in pots for experiment next spring ; and I
fear this will upset my little theory. . . . Campanula carpa-
tkica, as I found this summer, is absolutely sterile if insects
are excluded. Specularia speculum is fairly fertile when
enclosed ; and this seemed to me to be partially effected by
the frequent closing of the flower ; the inward angular folds
of the corolla corresponding with the clefts of the open
stigma, and in this action pushing pollen from the outside of
the stigma on to its surface. Now can you tell me, does 5 .
perfoliata close its flower like 5 . speculum, with angular inward
folds ? if so, I am smashed without some fearful  wriggling.
Are the imperfect flowers of your Specularia the early or the
later ones ? very early or very late ? It is rather pretty to
see the importance of the closing of flowers of 5 . speculum.

CHAPTER X.
CLIMBING AND INSECTIVOROUS PLANTS.
[My father mentions in his Autobiography (vol. L p. 92)
that he was led to take up the subject of climbing plants
by reading Dr. Grays paper, Note on the Coiling of the
Tendrils of Plants.  This essay seems to have been read
in 1862, but I am only able to guess at the date of the letter
in which he asks for a reference to it, so that the precise
date of his beginning this work cannot be determined.
In June 1863 he was certainly at work, and wrote to Sir J.
D. Hooker for information as to previous publications on the
subject, being then in ignorance of Palms and H. v. Mohls
works on climbing plants, both of which were published in

My DEAR HOOKER,  I have been observing pretty care-
fully a little fact which has surprised me ; and I want to know
from you and Oliver whether it seems new or odd to you, so
just tell me whenever you write ; it is a very trifling fact, so do
not answer on purpose.
I have got a plant of Echinocystis lobata to observe the
irritability of the tendrils described by Asa Gray, and which
of course, is plain enough. Having the plant in my study,
I have been surprised to find that the uppermost part of each

CLIMBING AND

branch (t.t. the stem between the two uppermost leaves ex-
cluding the growing tip) is constantly and slowly twisting roind
making a circle in from one and a half to two hours ; it will
sometimes go round two or three times, and then at the same
rate untwists and twists in opposite directions. It generally
rests half an hour before it retrogrades. The stem does not
become permanently twisted. The stem beneath the twisting
portion does not move in the least, though not tied. The move-
ment goes on all day and all early night. It has no relation to
light, for the plant stands in my window and twists from the
light just as quickly as towards it This may be a common
phenomenon for what I know, but it confounded me quite,
when I began to observe the irritability of the tendrils. I do
not say it is the final cause, but the result is pretty, for the plant
every one and a half or two hours sweeps a circle (according
to the length of the bending shoot and the length of the
tendril) of from one foot to twenty inches in diameter, and
immediately that the tendril touches any object its sensitive-
ness causes it immediately to seize it ; a clever gardener, my
neighbour, who saw the plant on my table last night, said :
"I believe, Sir, the tendrils can see, for wherever I put a
plant it finds out any stick near enough. I believe the
above is the explanation, viz. that it sweeps slowly round and
round. The tendrils have some sense, for they do not grasp
each other when young.
Yours affectionately,
C. Darwin.
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to J. D. Hooker.
Down, July 14 [1863].
My DEAR HOOKER,  I am getting very much amused by
my tendrils, it is just the sort of niggling work which suits
me, and takes up no time and rather rests me whilst writing.
So will you just think whether you know any plant, which

you could give or lend me, or I could buy, with tendrils, re-
markable in any way for development, for odd or peculiar
structure, or even for an odd place in natural arrangement. I
have seen or can see Cucurbitaceae, Passion-flower, Virginian-
creeper, Cissus discolor , Common-pea and Everlasting-pea. It
is really curious the diversification of irritability (I do not
mean the spontaneous movement, about which I wrote before
and correctly, as further observation shows) ; for instance, I find
a slight pinch between the thumb and finger at the end of the
tendril of the Cucurbitaceae causes prompt movement, but a
pinch excites no movement in Cissus. The cause is that one
side alone (the concave) is irritable in the former ; whereas both
sides are irritable in Cissus, so if you excite at the same time
both opposite sides there is no movement, but by touching
with a pencil the two branches of the tendril, in any part
whatever, you cause movement towards that point; so that
I can mould, by a mere touch, the two branches into any
shape I like. . . ,
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to Asa Gray.
Down, August 4 [1863].
My present hobby-horse I owe to you, viz. the tendrils :
their irritability is beautiful, as beautiful in all its modifica-
tions as anything in Orchids. About the spontaneous move-
ment (independent of touch) of the tendrils and upper inter-
nodes, I am rather taken aback by your saying,  is it not well
known ?  I can find nothing in any book which I have. . . .
The spontaneous movement of the tendrils is independent of
the movement of the upper intemodes, but both work har-
moniously together in sweeping a circle for the tendrils to
grasp a stick. So with all climbing plants (without tendrils)
as yet examined, the upper intemodes go on night and day
sweeping a circle in one fixed direction. It is surprising to
watch the Apocynese with shoots 18 inches long (beyond the
supporting stick), steadily searching for something to climb
314
CLIMBING AND
[1864.
up. When the shoot meets a stick, the motion at that point
is arrested, but in the upper part is continued ; so that the
climbing of all plants yet examined is the simple result of the
spontaneous circulatory movement of the upper internodes.
Pray tell me whether anything has been published on this
subject ? I hate publishing what is old ; but I shall hardly
regret my work if it is old, as it has much amused me. . . .

.... An Irish nobleman on his death-bed declared that he
could conscientiously say that he had never throughout life
denied himself any pleasure ; and I can conscientiously say
that I have never scrupled to trouble you ; so here goes.
Have you travelled South, and can you tell me whether the
trees, which Bignonia capreolata climbs, are covered with
moss or filamentous lichen or Tillandsia ? * I ask because its
tendrils abhor a simple stick, do not much relish rough bark,
but delight in wool or moss. They adhere in a curious
manner by making little disks, like the Ampelopsis. ... By
the way, I will enclose some specimens, and if you think it
worth while, you can put them under the simple microscope.
It is remarkable how specially adapted some tendrils are;
those of Eccretnocarpus scaber do not like a stick, will have
nothing to say to wool ; but give them a bundle of culms of
grass, or a bundle of bristles and they seize them well.

find that I have a good deal of new matter. It is strange,
but I really think no one has explained simple twining
plants. These books have stirred me up, and made me
wish for plants specified in them. I shall be very glad of
those you mention. I have written to Veitch for young
Nepenthes and Vanilla (which I believe will turn out a grand
case, though a root creeper), and if I cannot buy young
Vanilla I will ask you. I have ordered a leaf-climbing fern,
Lygodium. All this work about climbers would hurt my
conscience, did I think I could do harder work.*
[He continued his observations on climbing plants during
the prolonged illness from which he suffered in the autumn
of 1863, and in the following spring. He wrote to Sir J. D.
Hooker, apparently in March 1864 :
" For several days I have been decidedly better, and what
I lay much stress on (whatever doctors say), my brain feels
far stronger, and I have lost many dreadful sensations. The
hot-house is such an amusement to me, and my amusement
I owe to you, as my delight is to look at the many odd
leaves and plants from Kew. . . . The only approach to
work which I can do is to look at tendrils and climbers,
this does not distress my weakened brain. Ask Oliver to
look over the enclosed queries (and do you look) and amuse
a broken-down brother naturalist by answering any which
he can. If you ever lounge through your houses, remember
me and climbing plants.
CTTXTHR On October 29, 1864, he wrote to Dr. Gray :
 I have not been able to resist doing a little more at your
godchild, my climbing paper, or rather in size little book,
which by Jove I will have copied out, else I shall never stop.
This has been new sort of work for me, and I have been
pleased to find what a capital guide for observations a full
conviction of the change of species is.

 It is working hours, but I am trying to take a days
holiday, for I finished and despatched yesterday my climbing
paper. For the last ten days I have done nothing but correct
refractory sentences, and I loathe the whole subject.
A letter to Dr. Gray, April 9, 1865, has a word or two on
the subject.
 I have begun correcting proofs of my paper on * Climbing
Plants. I suppose I shall be able to send you a copy in four
or five weeks. I think it contains a good deal new and some
curious points, but it is so fearfully long, that no one will ever
read it If, however, you do not skim through it, you will be
an unnatural parent, for it is your child.
Dr. Gray not only read it but approved of it, to my fathers
great satisfaction, as the following extracts show :
 I was much pleased to get your letter of July 24th. Now
that I can do nothing, I maunder over old subjects, and your
approbation of my climbing paper gives me very great satis-
faction. I made my observations when I could do nothing
else and much enjoyed it, but always doubted whether they
were worth publishing. I demur to its not being necessary
to explain in detail about the spires in caught tendrils run-
ning in opposite directions ; for the fact for a long time con-
founded me, and I have found it difficult enough to explain
the cause to two or three persons. (Aug. 15, 1865.)
 I received yesterday your article * on climbers, and it has
pleased me in an extraordinary and even silly manner. You
pay me a superb compliment, and as I have just said to my
wife, I think my friends must perceive that I like praise,
they give me such hearty doses. I always admire your skill
in reviews or abstracts, and you have done this article ex-
cellently and given the whole essence of my paper. .... I
have had a letter from a good Zoologist in S. Brazil, F.
Muller, who has been stirred up to observe climbers and

gives me some curious cases of ��ra��c//-climbers, in which
branches are converted into tendrils, and then continue to
grow and throw out leaves and new branches, and then lose
their tendril character. (October 1865.)
The paper on Climbing Plants was republished in 1875, as
a separate book. The author had been unable to give his
customary amount of care to the style of the original essay,
owing to the fact that it was written during a period of
continued ill-health, and it was now found to require a great
deal of alteration. CTTXTHR He wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker (March 3,
1875) : * It is lucky for authors in general that they do not
require such dreadful work in merely licking what they write
into shape. CTTXTHR And to Mr. Murray in September he wrote :
The corrections are heavy in Climbing Plants, and yet
1 deliberately went over the MS. and old sheets three times.
The book was published in September 1875, an edition of
1500 copies was struck off; the edition sold fairly well, and
500 additional copies were printed in June of the following
year.]
INSECTIVOROUS PLANTS.
[In the summer of i860 he was staying at the house of his
sister-in-law, Miss Wedgwood, in Ashdown Forest, whence
he wrote (CTTXTHR July 29, i860), to Sir Joseph Hooker :
 Latterly I have done nothing here ; but at first I amused
myself with a few observations on the insect-catching power
of Drosera ; and I must consult you some time whether my
' twaddle  is worth communicating to the Linnean Society.
In August he wrote to the same friend :
 I will gratefully send my notes on Drosera when copied
by my copier : the subject amused me when I had nothing
to do."
He has described in the Autobiography  (vol. i. p. 95), the
general nature of these early experiments. He noticed insects
sticking to the leaves, and finding that flies, &c., placed on
CLIMBING AND
318
[186a
the adhesive glands were held fast and embraced, he sus-
pected that the leaves were adapted to supply nitrogenous
food to the plant. He therefore tried the effect on the leaves
of various nitrogenous fluids  with results which, as far as
they went, verified his surmise. In September, i860, he wrote
to Dr. Gray :
 I have been infinitely amused by working at Drosera :
the movements are really curious ; and the manner in which
the leaves detect certain nitrogenous compounds is mar-
vellous. You will laugh ; but it is, at present, my full belief
(after endless experiments) that they detect (and move in
consequence of) the 5^ part of a single grain of nitrate of
ammonia ; but the muriate and sulphate of ammonia bother
their chemical skill, and they cannot make anything of the
nitrogen in these salts 1 I began this work on Drosera in
relation to gradation as throwing light on Dionaea.
Later in the autumn he was again obliged to leave home
for Eastbourne, where he continued his work on Drosera.
The work was so new to him that he found himself in diffi-
culties in the preparation of solutions, and became puzzled
over fluid and solid ounces, &c. &c. To a friend, the late
Mr. E. Cresy, who came to his help in the matter of weights
and measures, he wrote giving an account of the experiments.
The extract (November 2, i860) which follows illustrates
the almost superstitious precautions he often applied to his
researches :
 Generally I have scrutinised every gland and hair on the
leaf before experimenting ; but it occurred to me that I might
in some way affect the leaf ; though this is almost impossible,
as I scrutinised with equal care those that I put into distilled
water (the same water being used for dissolving the carbonate
of ammonia). I then cut off four leaves (not touching them
with my fingers), and put them in plain water, and four other
leaves into the weak solution, and after leaving them for an
hour and a half, I examined every hair on all eight leaves ;
i860.] insectivorous plants. 319
no change on the four in water ; every gland and hair affected
in those in ammonia.
I had measured the quantity of weak solution, and I
counted the glands which had absorbed the ammonia, and
were plainly affected ; the result convinced me that each
gland could not have absorbed more than or i n inu ��f
a grain. I have tried numbers of other experiments all
pointing to the same result. Some experiments lead me to
believe that very sensitive leaves are acted on by much
smaller doses. Reflect how little ammonia a plant can get
growing on poor soil  yet it is nourished. The really sur-
prising part seems to me that the effect should be visible,
and not under very high power ; for after trying a high power,
I thought it would be safer not to consider any effect which
was not plainly visible under a two-thirds object glass and
middle eye-piece. The effect which the carbonate of ammonia
produces is the segregation of the homogeneous fluid in the
cells into a cloud of granules and colourless fluid ; and
subsequently the granules coalesce into larger masses, and for
hours have the oddest movements  coalescing, dividing,
coalescing ad infinitum. I do not know whether you will
care for these ill-written details ; but, as you asked, I am sure
I am bound to comply, after all the very kind and great
trouble which you have taken.
CTTXTHR On his return home he wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker
(November 21, i860).
 I have been working like a madman at Drosera. Here
is a fact for you which is certain as you stand where you
are, though you wont believe it, that a bit of hair rs -J TO of
one grain in weight placed on gland, will cause one of the
gland-bearing hairs of Drosera to curve inwards, and will alter
the condition of the contents of every cell in the foot-stalk of
the gland.
And a few days later to Lyell :
 I will and must finish my Drosera MS., which will take
320
CLIMBING AND
[1862.
me a week, for, at the present moment, I care more about
Drosera than the origin of all the species in the world. But
I will not publish on Drosera till next year, for I am frightened
and astounded at my results. I declare it is a certain fact,
that one organ is so sensitive to touch, that a weight seventy-
eight-times less than that, viz., of a grain, which will
move the best chemical balance, suffices to cause a conspicu-
ous movement. Is it not curious that a plant should be
far more sensitive to the touch than any nerve in the human
body ? Yet I am perfectly sure that this is true. When I
am on my hobby-horse, I never can resist telling my friends
how well my hobby goes, so you must forgive the rider."
The work was continued, as a holiday task, at Bourne-
mouth, where he stayed during the autumn of 1862. The dis-
cussion in the following letter on  nervous matter  in Drosera
is of interest in relation to recent researches on the continuity
of protoplasm from cell to cell :]

My dear Hooker,  Do not read this till you have leisure.
If that blessed moment ever comes, I should be very glad to
have your opinion on the subject of this letter. I am led to
the opinion that Drosera must have diffused matter in organic
connection, closely analogous to the nervous matter of animals.
When the glands of one of the papillae or tentacles, in its
natural position is supplied with nitrogenised fluid and
certain other stimulants, or when loaded with an extremely
slight weight, or when struck several times with a needle, the
pedicel bends near its base in under one minute. These
varied stimulants are conveyed down the pedicel by some
means ; it cannot be vibration, for drops of fluid put on quite
quietly cause the movement ; it cannot be absorption of the

INSECTIVOROUS PLANTS.
321
fluid from cell to cell, for I can see the rate of absorption,
which though quick, is far slower, and in Dionaea the trans-
mission is instantaneous ; analogy from animals would point
to transmission through nervous matter. Reflecting on
the rapid power of absorption in the glands, the extreme
sensibility of the whole organ, and the conspicuous move-
ment caused by varied stimulants, I have tried a number of
substances which are not caustic or corrosive,
but most of which are known to have a remarkable action
on the nervous matter of animals. You will see the results
in the enclosed paper. As the nervous matter of different
animals are differently acted on by the same poisons, one
would not expect the same action on plants and animals ;
only, if plants have diffused nervous matter, some degree of
analogous action. And this is partially the case. Consider-
ing these experiments, together with the previously made
remarks on the functions of the parts, I cannot avoid the
conclusion, that Drosera possesses matter at least in some
degree analogous in constitution and function to nervous
matter. Now do tell me what you think, as far as you can
judge from my abstract ; of course many more experiments
would have to be tried ; but in former years I tried on
the whole leaf, instead of on separate glands, a number of
innocuous * substances, such as sugar, gum, starch, &c., and
they produced no effect Your opinion will aid me in decid-
ing some future year in going on with this subject I should
not have thought it worth attempting, but I had nothing on
earth to do.

Drosera, and then broke down ; so that we took a house near
Sevenoaks for three weeks (where I now am) to get complete
rest. I have very little power of working now, and must put off
the rest of the work on Drosera till next spring, as my plants
are dying. It is an endless subject, and I must cut it short,
and for this reason shall not do much on Dionaea. The
point which has interested me most is tracing the nerves l
which follow the vascular bundles. By a prick with a sharp
lancet at a certain point, I can paralyse one-half the leaf, so
that a stimulus to the other half causes no movement. It is
just like dividing the spinal marrow of a frog :  no stimulus
can be sent from the brain or anterior part of the spine to the
hind legs ; but if these latter are stimulated, they move by
reflex action. I find my old results about the astonishing
sensitiveness of the nervous system (I ?) of Drosera to various
stimulants fully confirmed and extended. . . .

where his knowledge was defective, and here the advice and
assistance which he received from Dr. Burdon Sanderson was
of much value :]
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to J. Burdon Sanderson.
Down, July 25, 1873-
My dear Dr. Sanderson, I should like to tell you a
little about my recent work with Drosera, to show that I
have profited by your suggestions, and to ask a question or
1. It is really beautiful how quickly and well Drosera and
Dionaea dissolve little cubes of albumen and gelatine. I kept
the same sized cubes on wet moss for comparison. When
you were here I forgot that I had tried gelatine, but albumen
is far better for watching its dissolution and absorption.
Frankland has told me how to test in a rough way for
pepsine ; and in the autumn he will discover what acid the
digestive juice contains.
2. A decoction of cabbage-leaves and green peas causes
as much inflection as an infusion of raw meat ; a decoction of
grass is less powerful. Though I hear that the chemists try
to precipitate all albumen from the extract of belladonna, I
think they must fail, as the extract causes inflection, whereas
a new lot of atropine, as well as the valerianate [of atropine],
produce no effect.
3. I have been trying a good many experiments with
heated water. . . . Should you not call the following case one
of heat rigor ? Two leaves were heated to 130�� and had every
tentacle closely inflected ; one was taken out and placed in
cold water, and it re-expanded ; the other was heated to 145 0 ,
and had not the least power of re-expansion. Is not this
latter case heat rigor ? If you can inform me, I should very
much like to hear at what temperature cold-blooded and
invertebrate animals are killed.
324 CLIMBING AND [1873.
4. I must tell you my final result, of which I am sure,
[as to] the sensitiveness of Drosera. I made a solution of
one part of phosphate of ammonia by weight to 218,750
of water; of this solution I gave so much that a leaf
got -gtfoQ of a grain of the phosphate. I then counted the
glands, and each could have got only n i z h smt a g ra ' n i
this being absorbed by the glands, sufficed to cause the
tentacles bearing these glands to bend through an angle of
180��. Such sensitiveness requires hot weather, and carefully
selected young yet mature leaves. It strikes me as a
wonderful fact I must add that I took every precaution, by
trying numerous leaves at the same time in the solution and
in the same water which was used for making the solution.
5. If you can persuade your friend to try the effects of
carbonate of ammonia on the aggregation of the white blood
corpuscles, I should very much like to hear the result.
I hope this letter will not have wearied you.
Believe me, yours very sincerely,
Charles Darwin.
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to W. Thiselton Dyer.
Down, 24 [December 1873 !}
My dear Mr. Dyer, I fear that you will think me a
great bore, but I cannot resist telling you that I have just
found out that the leaves of Pinguicula possess a beautifully
adapted power of movement. Last night I put on a row of
little flies near one edge of two youngish leaves ; and after 14
hours these edges are beautifully folded over so as to clasp
the flies, thus bringing the glands into contact with the upper
surfaces of the flies, and they are now secreting copiously
above and below the flies and no doubt absorbing. The acid
secretion has run down the channelled edge and has collected
in the spoon-shaped extremity, where no doubt the glands
are absorbing the delicious soup. The leaf on one side looks
1*74-] INSECTIVOROUS PLANTS. 325
just like the helix of a human ear, if you were to stuff flies
within the fold.
Yours most sincerely,
C. Darwin.
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to Asa Gray.
Down, June 3 [1874],
.... I am now hard at work getting my book on Drosera
& Co. ready for the printers, but it will take some time, for I
am always finding out new points to observe. I think you
will be interested by my observations on the digestive process
in Drosera ; the secretion contains an acid of the acetic series,
and some ferment closely analogous to, but not identical
with, pepsine ; for I have been making a long series of
comparative trials. No human being will believe what I
shall publish about the smallness of the doses of phosphate
of ammonia which act.

and when I found it stated that Felis and Bos inhabited

My dear Professor Donders, My son George writes
to me that he has seen you, and that you have been very kind
to him, for which I return to you my cordial thanks. He
tells me on your authority, of a fact which interests me in
the highest degree, and which I much wish to be allowed to
quote. It relates to the action of one millionth of a grain of
atropine on the eye. Now will you be so kind, whenever you
can find a little leisure, to tell me whether you yourself have

observed this fact, or believe it on good authority. I also
wish to know what proportion by weight the atropine bore
to the water of solution, and how much of the solution was
applied to the eye. The reason why I am so anxious on this
head is that it gives some support to certain facts repeatedly
observed by me with respect to the action of phosphate of
ammonia on Drosera. The 400&000 ��f a grain absorbed by
a gland clearly makes the tentacle which bears this gland
become inflected ; and I am fully convinced that 8000*0000
a grain of the crystallised salt (ie. containing about one-third
of its weight of water of crystallisation) does the same. Now
I am quite unhappy at the thought of having to publish such
a statement. It will be of great value to me to be able to
give any analogous facts in support The case of Drosera is
all the more interesting as the absorption of the salt or any
other stimulant applied to the gland causes it to transmit a
motor influence to the base of the tentacle which bears the
gland.
Pray forgive me for troubling you, and do not trouble your-
self to answer this until your health is fully re-established.
Pray believe me,
Yours very sincerely,
Charles Darwin.
[During the summer of 1874 he was at work on the genus
CTTXTHR Utricularia, and he wrote (July 16th) to Sir J. D. Hooker
giving some account of the progress of his work :
" I am rather glad you have not been able to send Utricu-
laria, for the common species has driven F. and me almost
mad. The structure is most complex. The bladders catch
a multitude of Entomostraca, and larvae of insects. The
mechanism for capture is excellent But there is much that
we cannot understand. From what I have seen to-day,
strongly suspect that it is necrophagous, i.e. that it cannot
digest, but absorbs decaying matter.

CTTXTHR He was indebted to Lady Dorothy Nevill for specimens of
the curious Utricularia montana, which is not aquatic like the
European species, but grows among the moss and dlbris on
the branches of trees. To this species the following letter
refers :]
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to Lady Dorothy Nevill.
Down, September 18 [1874].
Dear Lady Dorothy Nevill, I am so much obliged
to you. I was so convinced that the bladders were with the
leaves that I never thought of removing the moss, and this
was very stupid of me. The great solid bladder-like swellings
almost on the surface are wonderful objects, but are not the
true bladders. These I found on the roots near the surface,
and down to a depth of two inches in the sand. They are
as transparent as glass, from to of an inch in size, and
hollow. They have all the important points of structure of
the bladders of the floating English species, and I felt con-
fident I should find captured prey. And so I have to my
delight in two bladders, with clear proof that they had absorbed
food from the decaying mass. For Utricularia is a carrion-
feeder, and not strictly carnivorous like Drosera.
The great solid bladder-like bodies, I believe, are reservoirs
of water like a camels stomach. As soon as I have made
a few more observations, I mean to be so cruel as to give
your plant no water, and observe whether the great bladders
shrink and contain air instead of water; I shall then also
wash all earth from all roots, and see whether there are true
bladders for capturing subterranean insects down to the very
bottom of the pot. Now shall you think me very greedy, if
I say that supposing the species is not very precious, and
you have several, will you give me one more plant, and if
so, please to send it to  Orpington Station, S. E. R., to be
forwarded by foot messenger.

great kindness.

plant allied to CTTXTHR Medicago, but I will show them to Dr. Hooker.

My DEAR H.,  Your magnificent present of Aldrovanda
has arrived quite safe. I have enjoyed greatly a good look
at the shut leaves, one of which I cut open. It is an aquatic
Dionaea, which has acquired some structures identical with
those of Utricularia 1
If the leaves open, and I can transfer them open under
the microscope, I will try some experiments, for mortal man
cannot resist the temptation. If I cannot transfer, I will do
nothing, for otherwise it would require hundreds of leaves.
You are a good man to give me such pleasure.
Yours affectionately,
C. Darwin.
[The manuscript of  Insectivorous Plants  was finished in
March 1875. He seems to have been more than usually
oppressed by the writing of this book, thus he wrote to Sir
J. D. Hooker in February :
 You ask about my book, and all that I can say is that
I am ready to commit suicide ; I thought it was decently
written, but find so much wants rewriting, that it will not be
ready to go to printers for two months, and will then make
a confoundedly big book. Murray will say that it is no use
publishing in the middle of summer, so I do not know what
will be the upshot ; but I begin to think that every one who
publishes a book is a fool.
The book was published on July 2nd, 1875, and 2700 copies
were sold out of the edition of 3000.]
CHAPTER XI.
THE  POWER OF MOVEMENT IN PLANTS. 1880.
[The few sentences in the autobiographical chapter give with
sufficient clearness the connection between the Power of
Movement, and one of the author's earlier books, that on
' Climbing Plants. The central idea of the book is that the
movements of plants in relation to light, gravitation, &c.,
are modifications of a spontaneous tendency to revolve or
circumnutate, which is widely inherent in the growing parts
of plants. This conception has not been generally adopted,
and has not taken a place among the canons of orthodox
physiology. The book has been treated by Professor Sachs
with a few words of professorial contempt ; and by Professor
Wiesner it has been honoured by careful and generously
expressed criticism.
Mr. Thiselton Dyer * has well said :  Whether this masterly
conception of the unity of what has hitherto seemed a chaos of
unrelated phenomena will be sustained, time alone will show.
But no one can doubt the importance of what Mr. Darwin
has done, in showing that for the future the phenomena of
plant movement can and indeed must be studied from a
single point of view.
The work was begun in the summer of 1877, after the
publication of * Different Forms of Flowers, and by the
autumn his enthusiasm for the subject was thoroughly estab-
lished, and he wrote to Mr. Dyer : I am all on fire at the
  Charles Darwin  ( Nature  Series), p. 41.

work. At this time he was studying the movements of
cotyledons, in which the sleep of plants is to be observed in
its simplest form ; in the following spring he was trying to
discover what useful purpose these sleep-movements could
serve, and wrote to Sir Joseph Hooker (March 25th, 1878):
 I think we have proved that the sleep of plants is to lessen
the injury to the leaves from radiation. This has interested
me much, and has cost us great labour, as it has been a
problem since the time of Linnaeus. But we have killed or
badly injured a multitude of plants : N.B.  Oxalis camosa
was most valuable, but last night was killed.
His letters of this period do not give any connected account
of the progress of the work. The two following seem worth
giving as being characteristic of the author :]
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to W. Thiselton Dyer.
Down, June 2, 1878.
My dear Dyer,  I remember saying that I should die a
disgraced man if I did not observe a seedling Cactus and
Cycas, and you have saved me from this horrible fate, as they
move splendidly and normally. But I have two questions to
ask : the Cycas observed was a huge seed in a broad and
very shallow pot with cocoa-nut fibre as I suppose. It was
named only Cycas. Was it Cycas pectinata t I suppose that
I cannot be wrong in believing that what first appears above
ground is a true leaf, for I can see no stem or axis. Lastly,
you may remember that I said that we could not raise
Opuntia nigricans ; now I must confess to a piece of stupidity ;
one did come up, but my gardener and self stared at it, and
concluded that it could not be a seedling Opuntia, but now that
I have seen one of 0 . basilaris, I am sure it was ; I observed
it only casually, and saw movements, which makes me wish

Lynch  be so kind as to send one more ?
I am working away like a slave at radicles [roots] and at
movements of true leaves, for I have pretty well done with
cotyledons. . . .
That was an excellent letter about the Gardens : t I had
hoped that the agitation was over. Politicians are a poor
truckling lot, for [they] must see the wretched effects of
keeping the gardens open all day long.

November 21 [1878].
My DEAR Dyer,  I must thank you for all the wonderful
trouble which you have taken about the seeds of Impatiens
and on scores of other occasions. It in truth makes me feel
ashamed of myself, and I cannot help thinking:  Oh Lord,
when he sees our book he will cry out, is this all for which I
have helped so much !  In seriousness, I hope that we have
made out some points, but I fear that we have done very little
for the labour which we have expended on our work. We are
here for a week for a little rest, which I needed.
If I remember right, November 30th, is the anniversary at
the Royal, and I fear Sir Joseph must be almost at the last
gasp. I shall be glad when he is no longer President.
Yours very sincerely,
C. Darwin.

despondingly to Mr. Dyer:  I am overwhelmed with my
notes, and almost too old to undertake the job which I have
in hand  i.e., movements of all kinds. Yet it is worse to be
idle."
Later on in the year, when the work was approaching com-
pletion, he wrote to Prof. Carus (July 17, 1879), with respect
to a translation :
 Together with my son Francis, I am preparing a rather
large volume on the general movements of Plants, and I think
that we have made out a good many new points and views.
 I fear that our views will meet a good deal of opposition
in Germany ; but we have been working very hard for some
years at the subject.
 I shall be much pleased if you think the book worth trans-
lating, and proof-sheets shall be sent you, whenever they are
ready.
In the autumn he was hard at work on the manuscript, and
wrote to Dr. Gray (October 24, 1879) :
 I have written a rather big book  more is the pity on
the movements of plants, and I am now just beginning to go
over the MS. for the second time, which is a horrid bore.

philosophical remarks new to me, and no doubt shall find
many more. They have recalled many a puzzle through
which I passed when monographing the Cirripedia ; and your
book in those days would have been quite invaluable to me.
It has pleased me to find that I have always followed your
plan of making notes on separate pieces of paper ; I keep
several scores of large portfolios, arranged on very thin shelves
about two inches apart, fastened to the walls of my study,
and each shelf has its proper name or title ; and I can thus
put at once every memorandum into its proper place. Your
book will, I am sure, be very useful to many young students,
and I shall beg my son Francis (who intends to devote himself
to the physiology of plants) to read it carefully.
As for myself I am taking a fortnights rest, after sending
a pile of MS. to the printers, and it was a piece of good
fortune that your book arrived as I was getting into my
carriage, for I wanted something to read whilst away from
home. My MS. relates to the movements of plants, and I
think that I have succeeded in showing that all the more
important great classes of movements are due to the modifi-
cation of a kind of movement common to all parts of all
plants from their earliest youth.
Pray give my kind remembrances to your son, and with my
highest respect and best thanks,
Believe me, my dear Sir, yours very sincerely,
Charles Darwin.
P.S.  It always pleases me to exalt plants in the organic
scale, and if you will take the trouble to read my last chapter
when my book (which will be sadly too big) is published and
sent to you, I hope and think that you also will admire some
of the beautiful adaptations by which seedling plants are
enabled to perform their proper functions.

copies were disposed of at Mr. Murrays sale. With regard to
it he wrote to Sir J. D. Hooker (November 23) :
Your note has pleased me much  for I did not expect
that you would have had time to read any of it Read the
last chapter, and you will know the whole result, but without
the evidence. The case, however, of radicles bending after
exposure for an hour to geotropism, with their tips (or brains)
cut off is, I think, worth your reading (bottom of p. 525) ; it
astounded me. The next most remarkable fact, as it ap-
peared to me (p. 148), is the discrimination of the tip of the
radicle between a slightly harder and softer object affixed
on opposite sides of tip. But I will bother you no more
about my book. The sensitiveness of seedlings to light is
marvellous.
To another friend, Mr. Thiselton Dyer, he wrote (Novem-
ber 28, 1880) :
Very many thanks for your most kind note, but you
think too highly of our work, not but what this is very
pleasant .... Many of the Germans are very contemp-
tuous about making out the use of organs ; but they may
sneer the souls out of their bodies, and I for one shall think
it the most interesting part of Natural History. Indeed you
are greatly mistaken if you doubt for one moment on the very
great value of your constant and most kind assistance to us."
The book was widely reviewed, and excited much interest
among the general public. The following letter refers to a
leading article in the Times, November 20, 1880:]

touched my heart. I often think of old days and of the
delight of my visits to Woodhouse, and of the deep debt of
gratitude which I owe to your father. It was very good of
you to write. I had quite forgotten my old ambition about
the Shrewsbury newspaper ; * but I remember the pride
which I felt when I saw in a book about beetles the impressive
words  captured by C. Darwin. Captured sounded so grand
compared with caught. This seemed to me glory enough for
any man ! I do not know in the least what made the Times
glorify me,t for it has sometimes pitched into me ferociously.
I should very much like to see you again, but you would
find a visit here very dull, for we feel very old and have no
amusement, and lead a solitary life. But we intend in a few
weeks to spend a few days in London, and then if you have
anything else to do in London, you would perhaps come and
lunch with us.$

C. CTTXTHR Darwin to Julius Wiesner.
Down, October 25th, 1881.
My DEAR SIR,  I have now finished your book,* and have
understood the whole except a very few passages. In the
first place, let me thank you cordially for the manner in which
you have everywhere treated me. You have shown how a
man may differ from another in the most decided manner,
and yet express his difference with the most perfect courtesy.
Not a few English and German naturalists might learn a
useful lesson from your example; for the coarse language
often used by scientific men towards each other does no good,
and only degrades science.
I have been profoundly interested by your book, and some
of your experiments are so beautiful, that I actually felt
pleasure while being vivisected. It would take up too much
space to discuss all the important topics in your book. I fear
that you have quite upset the interpretation which I have
given of the effects of cutting off the tips of horizontally
extended roots, and of those laterally exposed to moisture ;
but I cannot persuade myself that the horizontal position of
lateral branches and roots is due simply to their lessened
power of growth. Nor when I think of my experiments with
the cotyledons of Phalaris, can I give up the belief of the
transmission of some stimulus due to light from the upper
to the lower part At p. 60 you have misunderstood my
meaning, when you say that I believe that the effects from
light are transmitted to a part which is not itself heliotropic
I never considered whether or not the short part beneath the
ground was heliotropic ; but I believe that with young seed-
lings the part which bends near, but above the ground is
heliotropic, and I believe so from this part bending only
moderately when the light is oblique, and bending rectan-
gularly when the light is horizontal. Nevertheless the bending

of this lower part, as I conclude from my experiments with
opaque caps, is influenced by the action of light on the upper
part. My opinion, however, on the above and many other
points, signifies very little, for I have no doubt that your book
will convince most botanists that I am wrong in all the points
on which we differ.
Independently of the question of transmission, my mind is
so full of facts leading me to believe that light, gravity, &c.,
act not in a direct manner on growth, but as stimuli, that I
am quite unable to modify my judgment on this head. I
could not understand the passage at p. 78, until I consulted
my son George, who is a mathematician. He supposes that
your objection is founded on the diffused light from the lamp
illuminating both sides of the object, and not being reduced,
with increasing distance in the same ratio as the direct light ;
but he doubts whether this necessary correction will account
for the very little difference in the heliotropic curvature of the
plants in the successive pots.
With respect to the sensitiveness of the tips of roots to
contact, I cannot admit your view until it is proved that I am
in error about bits of card attached by liquid gum causing
movement ; whereas no movement was caused if the card
remained separated from the tip by a layer of the liquid gum.
The fact also of thicker and thinner bits of card attached on
opposite sides of the same root by shellac, causing movement
in one direction, has to be explained. You often speak of the
tip having been injured ; but externally there was no sign of
injury : and when the tip was plainly injured, the extreme
part became curved towards the injured side. I can no more
believe that the tip was injured by the bits of card, at least
when attached by gum-water, than that the glands of Drosera
are injured by a particle of thread or hair placed on it, or that
the human tongue is so when it feels any such object

at the difference in our conclusions ; but I could not fully
understand some parts which my son Francis will be able to
translate to me when he returns home. The greater part of
your book is beautifully clear.
Finally, I wish that I had enough strength and spirit to
commence a fresh set of experiments, and publish the results,
with a full recantation of my errors when convinced of them ;
but I am too old for such an undertaking, nor do I suppose
that I shall be able to do much, or any more, original work.
I imagine that I see one possible source of error in your
beautiful experiment of a plant rotating and exposed to a
lateral light.
With high respect and with sincere thanks for the kind
manner in which you have treated me and my mistakes, I
remain.
My dear Sir, yours sincerely,
Charles Darwin.

in water they appear as if encased in thin glass ? It is really
a pretty sight to put a pod of the common pea, or a raspberry
into water. I find several leaves are thus protected on the
under surface and not on the upper.
 How can water injure the leaves if indeed this is at all
the case ?
CTTXTHR On this latter point he wrote to Sir Thomas Farrer
 I am now become mad about drops of water injuring
leaves. Please ask Mr. Paine * whether he believes, from his
own experience, that drops of water injure leaves or fruit in his
conservatories. It is said that the drops act as burning-glasses ;
if this is true, they would not be at all injurious on cloudy
days. As he is so acute a man, I should very much like to
hear his opinion. I remember when I grew hot-house orchids
I was cautioned not to wet their leaves ; but I never then
thought on the subject.
 I enjoyed my visit greatly with you, and I am very sure
that all England could not afford a kinder and pleasanter
host
Some years later he took up the subject again, and wrote to
Sir Joseph Hooker (May 25, 1877):
" I have been looking over my old notes about the bloom
on plants, and I think that the subject is well worth pursuing,
though I am very doubtful of any success. Are you inclined
to aid me on the mere chance of success, for without your aid
I could do hardly anything ? ]

you give me any light ? Are such plants commoner in warm
than in colder climates ? I ask because I often walk out in
heavy rain, and the leaves of very few wild dicotyledons can
be here seen with drops of water rolling off them like quick-
silver. Whereas in my flower garden, greenhouse, and hot-
houses there are several. Again, are bloom-protected plants
common on your dry western plains ? Hooker thinks that they
are common at the Cape of Good Hope. It is a puzzle to me
if they are common under very dry climates, and I find bloom
very common on the Acacias and Eucalypti of Australia.
Some of the Eucalypti which do not appear to be covered with
bloom have the epidermis protected by a layer of some
substance which is dissolved in boiling alcohol. Are there
any bloom-protected leaves or fruit in the Arctic regions?
If you can illuminate me, as you so often have done, pray do
so ; but otherwise do not bother yourself by answering.

My dear Dyer,  One word to thank you. I declare had
it not been for your kindness, we should have broken down.
As it is we have made out clearly that with some plants (chiefly
succulent) the bloom checks evaporation  with some certainly
prevents attacks of insects ; with some sea-shore plants
prevents injury from salt-water, and, I believe, with a few
prevents injury from pure water resting on the leaves. This
latter is as yet the most doubtful and the most interesting
point in relation to the movements of plants.

My dear Sir,  Y our kindness is unbounded, and I cannot
tell you how much your last letter (May 31) has interested
me. I have piles of notes about the effect of water resting on
leaves, and their movements (as I supposed) to shake off the
drops. But I have not looked over these notes for a long
time, and had come to think that perhaps my notion was mere
fancy, but I had intended to begin experimenting as soon as
I returned home ; and now with your invaluable letter about
the position of the leaves of various plants during rain (I have
one analogous case with Acacia from South Africa), I shall
be stimulated to work in earnest.
Variability.
[The following letter refers to a subject on which my father
felt the strongest interest the experimental investigation of
the causes of variability. The experiments alluded to were

vary, and no experiments as yet tried have thrown any light
on the subject Now for the last ten years I have been
experimenting in crossing and self-fertilising plants ; and one
indirect result has surprised me much ; namely, that by taking
pains to cultivate plants in pots under glass during several
successive generations, under nearly similar conditions, and by
self-fertilising them in each generation, the colour of the
flowers often changes, and, what is very remarkable, they
became in some of the most variable species, such as Mimulus,
Carnation, &c., quite constant, like those of a wild species.
This fact and several others have led me to the suspicion
that the cause of variation must be in different substances
absorbed from the soil by these plants when their powers of
absorption are not interfered with by other plants with which
they grow mingled in a state of nature. Therefore my son
and I wish to grow plants in pots in soil entirely, or as nearly
entirely as is possible, destitute of all matter which plants
absorb, and then to give during several successive generations
to several plants of the same species as different solutions as
may be compatible with their life and health. And now, can
you advise me how to make soil approximately free of all the
substances which plants naturally absorb ? I suppose white
silver sand, sold for cleaning harness, &c., is nearly pure silica,
but what am I to do for alumina ? Without some alumina I
imagine that it would be impossible to keep the soil damp
and fit for the growth of plants. I presume that clay washed
over and over again in water would still yield mineral matter
to the carbonic acid secreted by the roots. I should want a
good deal of soil, for it would be useless to experimentise
unless we could fill from twenty to thirty moderately sized
flower-pots every year. Can you suggest any plan ? for unless
you can it would, I fear, be useless for us to commence an
attempt to discover whether variability depends at all on
matter absorbed from the soil. After obtaining the requisite
kind of soil, my notion is to water one set of plants with

nitrate of potassium, another set with nitrate of sodium, and
another with nitrate of lime, giving all as much phosphate of
ammonia as they seemed to support, for I wish the plants to
grow as luxuriantly as possible. The plants watered with
nitrate of Na and of Ca would require, I suppose, some K ; but
perhaps they would get what is absolutely necessary from such
soil as I should be forced to employ, and from the rain-water
collected in tanks. I could use hard water from a deep well
in the chalk, but then all the plants would get lime. If the
plants to which I give Nitrate of Na and of Ca would not
grow I might give them a little alum.
I am well aware how very ignorant I am, and how crude
my notions are ; and if you could suggest any other solutions
by which plants would be likely to be affected it would be a
very great kindness. I suppose that there are no organic
fluids which plants would absorb, and which I could procure?
I must trust to your kindness to excuse me for troubling
you at such length, and,
I remain, dear Sir, yours sincerely,
Charles Darwin.

environment ; but whether I said so I know not, for without
being asked I should have thought it presumptuous to have
criticised your book, nor should I now say so had I not during
the last few days been struck with Professor Hoffmanns
review of his own work in the  Botanische Zcitung, on the
variability of plants ; and it is really surprising how little effect
he produced by cultivating certain plants under unnatural
conditions, as the presence of salt, lime, zinc, &c., &c., during
several generations. Plants, moreover, were selected which
were the most likely to vary under such conditions, judging
from the existence of closely-allied forms adapted for these
conditions. No doubt I originally attributed too little weight
to the direct action of conditions, but Hoffmanns paper has
staggered me. Perhaps hundreds of generations of exposure
are necessary. It is a most perplexing subject I wish
I was not so old, and had more strength, for I see lines
of research to follow. Hoffmann even doubts whether
plants vary more under cultivation than in their native home
and under their natural conditions. If so, the astonishing
variations of almost all cultivated plants must be due to
selection and breeding from the varying individuals. This
idea crossed my mind many years ago, but I was afraid to
publish it, as I thought that people would say,  how he does
exaggerate the importance of selection.
I still must believe that changed conditions give the impulse
to variability, but that they act in most cases in a very
indirect manner. But, as I said, it is a most perplexing pro-
blem. Pray forgive me for writing at such length ; I had no
intention of doing so when I sat down to write.
I am extremely sorry to hear, for your own sake and for
that of Science, that you are so hard worked, and that so much
of your time is consumed in official labour.
Pray believe me, dear Professor Semper,

Galls.
[Shortly before his death, my father began to experimentise
on the possibility of producing galls artificially. A letter to
Sir J. D. Hooker (Nov. 3, 1880) shows the interest which he
felt in the question
 I was delighted with Pagets Essay ; * I hear that he has
occasionally attended to this subject from his youth ....
I am very glad he has called attention to galls : this has
always seemed to me a profoundly interesting subject ; and if
I had been younger would take it up.
His interest in this subject was connected with his ever-
present wish to learn something of the causes of variation.
He imagined to himself wonderful galls caused to appear on
the ovaries of plants, and by these means he thought it possible
that the seed might be influenced, and thus new varieties
arise. He made a considerable number of experiments by
injecting various reagents into the tissues of leaves, and with
some slight indications of success.]

chemical knowledge about plants, and I am so poor, that I
appeal to your charity as a pauper. My question is  Do
you know of any solid substance in the cells of plants which
glycerine and water dissolves ? But you will understand my
perplexity better if I give you the facts : I mentioned to you
that if a plant of Euphorbia peplus is gently dug up and the
roots placed for a short time in a weak solution (i to 10,000
of water suffices in 24 hours) of carbonate of ammonia the
(generally) alternate longitudinal rows of cells in every
rootlet, from the root-cap up to the very top of the root (but
not as far as I have yet seen in the green stem) become
filled with translucent, brownish grains of matter. These
rounded grains often cohere and even become confluent.
Pure phosphate and nitrate of ammonia produce (though more
slowly) the same effect, as does pure carbonate of soda.
Now, if slices of root under a cover-glass are irrigated
with glycerine and water, every one of the innumerable
grains in the cells disappear after some hours. What am I
to think of this \ .
Forgive me for bothering you to 'such an extent ; but I
must mention that if the roots are dipped in boiling water
there is no deposition of matter, and carbonate of ammonia
afterwards produces no effect I should state that I now find
that the granular matter is formed in the cells immediately
beneath the thin epidermis, and a few other cells near the
vascular tissue. If the granules consisted of living protoplasm
(but I can see no traces of movement in them), then I should
infer that the glycerine killed them and aggregation ceased
with the diffusion of invisibly minute particles, for I have
seen an analogous phenomenon in Drosera.
If you can aid me, pray do so, and anyhow forgive me.
Yours very sincerely,
C. Darwin.

Mr. Torbitts Experiments on the Potato-Disease.
[Mr. James Torbitt, of Belfast, has been engaged for the
last twelve years in the difficult undertaking, in which he has
been to a large extent successful, of raising fungus-proof
varieties of the potato. My father felt great interest in Mr.
Torbitts work, and corresponded with him from 1876 on-
wards. The following letter, giving a clear account of Mr.
Torbitts method and of my fathers opinion of the probability
of its success, was written with the idea that Government
aid for the work might possibly be obtainable :]
C. CTTXTHR Darwin to T. H. Farrer.
Down, March 2, 1878.
My DEAR Farrer,  Mr. Torbitts plan of overcoming the
potato-disease seems to me by far the best which has ever
been suggested. It consists, as you know from his printed
letter, of rearing a vast number of seedlings from cross-fertil-
ised parents, exposing them to infection, ruthlessly destroying
all that suffer, saving those which resist best, and repeating
the process in successive seminal generations. My belief in
the probability of good results from this process rests on the
fact of all characters whatever occasionally varying. It is
known, for instance, that certain species and varieties of the
vine resist phylloxera better than others. Andrew Knight
found one variety or species of the apple which was not in
the least attacked by coccus, and another variety has been
observed in South Australia. Certain varieties of the peach
resist mildew, and several other such cases could be given.
Therefore there is no great improbability in a new variety of
potato arising which would resist the fungus completely, or
at least much better than any existing variety. With respect
to the cross-fertilisation of two distinct seedling plants, it has
been ascertained that the offspring thus raised inherit much

more vigorous constitutions and generally are more prolific
than seedlings from self-fertilised parents. It is also probable
that cross-fertilisation would be especially valuable in the
case of the potato, as there is reason to believe that the
flowers are seldom crossed by our native insects ; and some
varieties are absolutely sterile unless fertilised with pollen
from a distinct variety. There is some evidence that the good
effects from a cross are transmitted for several generations ;
it would not, therefore be necessary to cross-fertilise the
seedlings in each generation, though this would be desirable,
as it is almost certain that a greater number of seeds would
thus be obtained. It should be remembered that a cross
between plants raised from the tubers of the same plant,
though growing on distinct roots, does no more good than a
cross between flowers on the same individual. Considering
the whole subject, it appears to me that it would be a national
misfortune if the cross-fertilised seeds in Mr. Torbitts posses-
sion produced by parents which have already shown some
power of resisting the disease, are not utilised by the Govern-
ment, or some public body, and the process of selection
continued during several more generations.
Should the Agricultural Society undertake the work, Mr.
Torbitts knowledge gained by experience would be especially
valuable ; and an outline of the plan is given in his printed
letter. It would be necessary that all the tubers produced by
each plant should be collected separately, and carefully
examined in each succeeding generation.
It would be advisable that some kind of potato eminently
liable to the disease should be planted in considerable numbers
near the seedlings so as to infect them.
Altogether the trial would be one requiring much care and
extreme patience, as I know from experience with analogous
work, and it may be feared that it would be difficult to find
any one who would pursue the experiment with sufficient
energy. It seems, therefore, to me highly desirable that

Mr. Torbitt should be aided with some small grant so as to
continue the work himself.
Judging from his reports, his efforts have already been
crowned in so short a time with more success than could
have been anticipated ; and I think you will agree with me,
that any one who raises a fungus-proof potato will be a public
benefactor of no common kind.
My dear Farrer, yours sincerely,
Charles Darwin.
[After further consultation with Sir Thomas Farrer and
with Mr. Caird, my father became convinced that it was
hopeless to attempt to obtain Government aid. He wrote to
Mr. Torbitt to this effect, adding, it would be less trouble to
get up a subscription from a few rich leading agriculturists
than from Government This plan I think you cannot object
to, as you have asked nothing, and will have nothing whatever
to do with the subscription. In fact, the affair is, in my
opinion, a compliment to you. The idea thus broached was
carried out, and Mr. Torbitt was enabled to continue his work
by the aid of a sum to which Sir T. Farrer, Mr. Caird, my
father, and a few friends, subscribed.
My fathers sympathy and encouragement were highly
valued by Mr. Torbitt, who tells me that without them he
should long ago have given up his attempt A few extracts
will illustrate his fellow-feeling with Mr. Torbitts energy and
perseverance :
 I admire your indomitable spirit If any one ever
deserved success, you do so, and I keep to my original
opinion that you have a very good chance of raising a fungus-
proof variety of the potato.
A pioneer in a new undertaking is sure to meet with
many disappointments, so I hope that you will keep up your
courage, though we have done so very little for you.

Mr. Torbitt tells me that he still (1887) succeeds in raising
varieties possessing well-marked powers of resisting disease ;
but this immunity is not permanent, and, after some years, the
varieties become liable to the attacks of the fungus.]
The Kew Index of Plant-Names, or  Nomenclator
Botanicus Darwinianus.
[Some account of my fathers connection with the Index of
Plant-names now (1887) in course of preparation at Kew will
be found in Mr. B. Daydon Jacksons paper in the Journal of
Botany, 1887, p. 1 5 1. Mr. Jackson quotes the following state-
ment by Sir J. D. Hooker :
"Shortly before his death, Mr. Charles Darwin informed
Sir Joseph Hooker that it was his intention to devote
a considerable sum of money annually for some years in
aid or furtherance of some work or works of practical
utility to biological science, and to make provisions in his
will in the event of these not being completed during his
lifetime.
 Amongst other objects connected with botanical science,
Mr. Darwin regarded with especial interest the importance of
a complete index to the names and authors of the genera and
species of plants known to botanists, together with their
native countries. Steudels * Nomenclator  is the only existing
work of this nature, and although now nearly half a century
old, Mr. Darwin had found it of great aid in his own re-
searches. It has been indispensable to every botanical insti-
tution, whether as a list of all known flowering plants, as an
indication of their authors, or as a digest of botanical
geography."
Since 1840, when the Nomenclator was published, the
number of described plants may be said to have doubled, so
352

[1881-2.
that the  Nomenclator is now seriously below the require-
ments of botanical work. To remedy this want, the  Nomen-
clator  has been from time to time posted up in an inter-
leaved copy in the Herbarium at Kew, by the help of  funds
supplied by private liberality. *
My father, like other botanists, had as Sir Joseph Hooker
points out, experienced the value of Steudels work. He
obtained plants from all sorts of sources, which were often
incorrectly named, and he felt the necessity of adhering to
the accepted nomenclature, so that he might convey to other
workers precise indications as to the plants which he had
studied. It was also frequently a matter of importance to
him to know the native country of his experimental plants.
Thus it was natural that he should recognize the desirability of
completing and publishing the interleaved volume at Kew.
The wish to help in this object was heightened by the admira-
tion he felt for the results for which the world has to thank
the Royal Gardens at Kew, and by his gratitude for the in-
valuable aid which for so many years he received from its
Director and his staff. He expressly stated that it was his
wish  to aid in some way the scientific work carried on at
the Royal Gardens  f  which induced him to offer to supply
funds for the completion of the Kew  Nomenclator.
The following passage, for which I am indebted to Pro-
fessor Judd, is of interest, as illustrating the motives that
actuated my father in this matter. Professor Judd writes
 On the occasion of my last visit to him, he told me that
his income having recently greatly increased, while his wants
remained the same, he was most anxious to devote what he
could spare to the advancement of Geology or Biology. He
dwelt in the most touching manner on the fact that he owed
so much happiness and fame to the natural-history sciences

which had been the solace of what might have been a painful
existence ;  and he begged me, if I knew of any research
which could be aided by a grant of a few hundreds of pounds,
to let him know, as it would be a delight to him to feel that
he was helping in promoting the progress of science. He
informed me at the same time that he was making the same
suggestion to Sir Joseph Hooker and Professor Huxley with
respect to Botany and Zoology respectively. I was much
impressed by the earnestness, and, indeed, deep emotion, with
which he spoke of his indebtedness to Science, and his desire
to promote its interests.
Sir Joseph Hooker was asked by my father  to take into
consideration, with the aid of the botanical staff at Kew and
the late Mr. Bentham, the extent and scope of the proposed
work, and to suggest the best means of having it executed.
In doing this, Sir Joseph had further the advantage of the
great knowledge and experience of Professor Asa Gray, of
Cambridge, U.S.A., and of Mr. John Ball, F.R.S.*
The plan of the proposed work having been carefully
considered, Sir Joseph Hooker was able to confide its elabo-
ration in detail to Mr. B. Daydon Jackson, Secretary of the
Linnean Society, whose extensive knowledge of botanical
literature qualifies him for the task. My fathers original idea
of producing a modem edition of Steudel's  Nomenclator
has been practically abandoned, the aim now kept in view is
rather to construct a list of genera and species (with references)
founded on Bentham and Hookers  Genera Plantarum. The
colossal nature of the work in progress at Kew may be esti-
mated by the fact that the manuscript of the  Index  is at
the present time (1887) believed to weigh 'more than a ton.
Under Sir Joseph Hookers supervision the work goes steadily
forward, being carried out with admirable zeal by Mr. Jackson,
who devotes himself unsparingly to the enterprise, in which,

too, he has the advantage of the interest in the work felt by
Professor Oliver and Mr. Thiselton Dyer.
The Kew  Index, which will, in all probability, be ready
to go to press in four or five years, will be a fitting memorial
of my father : and his share in its completion illustrates a
part of his character  his ready sympathy with work outside
his own lines of investigation  and his respect for minute
and patient labour in all branches of science.]

CHAPTER XIII.
CONCLUSION.
SOME idea of the general course of my fathers health may
have been gathered from the letters given in the preceding
pages. The subject of health appears more prominently
than is often necessary in a Biography, because it was,
unfortunately, so real an element in determining the outward
form of his life.
During the last ten years of his life the state of his health
was a cause of satisfaction and hope to his family. His con-
dition showed signs of amendment in several particulars.
He suffered less distress and discomfort, and was able to
work more steadily. Something has been already said of
Dr. Bence Joness treatment, from which my father certainly
derived benefit. In later years he became a patient of
Sir Andrew Clark, under whose care he improved greatly
in general health. It was not only for his generously ren-
dered service that my father felt a debt of gratitude towards
Sir Andrew Clark. He owed to his cheering personal
influence an often-repeated encouragement, which latterly
added something real to his happiness, and he found sincere
pleasure in Sir Andrews friendship and kindness towards
himself and his children.
Scattered through the past pages are one or two references
to pain or uneasiness felt in the region of the heart. How
far these indicate that the heart was affected early in life,
I cannot pretend to say ; in any case it is certain that he
had no serious or permanent trouble of this nature until
2 A 2

shortly before his death. In spite of the general improve-
ment in his health, which has been above alluded to, there
was a certain loss of physical vigour occasionally apparent
during the last few years of his life. This is illustrated by
a sentence in a letter to his old friend Sir James Sulivan,
written on January 10, 1879: My scientific work tires me
more than it used to do, but I have nothing else to do, and
whether one is worn out a year or two sooner or later signi-
fies but little.
A similar feeling is shown in a letter to Sir J. D. Hooker
of June 15, 1881. My father was staying at Patterdale, and
wrote : I am rather despondent about myself .... I have
not the heart or strength to begin any investigation lasting
years, which is the only thing which I enjoy, and I have no
little jobs which I can do.
CTTXTHR In July, 1881, he wrote to Mr. Wallace, We have just
returned home after spending five weeks on Ullswater ; the
scenery is quite charming, but I cannot walk, and everything
tires me, even seeing scenery .... What I shall do with my
few remaining years of life I can hardly tell. I have every-
thing to make me happy and contented, but life has become
very wearisome to me. He was, however, able to do a good
deal of work, and that of a trying sort,* during the autumn
of 1881, but towards the end of the year he was clearly in
need of rest ; and during the winter was in a lower condition
than was usual with him.
On December 13, he went for a week to his daughter's
house in Bryanston Street. During his stay in London he
went to call on Mr. Romanes, and was seized when on the
door-step with an attack apparently of the same kind as those
which afterwards became so frequent. The rest of the in-
cident, which I give in Mr. Romanes words, is interesting too
from a different point of view, as giving one more illustration
of my fathers scrupulous consideration for others :

 I happened to be out, but my butler, observing that Mr.
Darwin was ill, asked him to come in. He said he would
prefer going home, and although the butler urged him to
wait at least until a cab could be fetched, he said he would
rather not give so much trouble. For the same reason he
refused to allow the butler to accompany him. Accordingly
he watched him walking with difficulty towards the direction
in which cabs were to be met with, and saw that, when he
had got about three hundred yards from the house, he stag-
gered and caught hold of the park-railings as if to prevent
himself from falling. The butler therefore hastened to his
assistance, but after a few seconds saw him turn round with
the evident purpose of retracing his steps to my house. How-
ever, after he had returned part of the way he seems to
have felt better, for he again changed his mind, and proceeded
to find a cab.
During the last week of February and in the. beginning of
March, attacks of pain in the region of the heart, with irre-
gularity of the pulse, became frequent, coming on indeed
nearly every afternoon. A seizure of this sort occurred about
March 7, when he was walking alone at a short distance from
the house ; he got home with difficulty, and this was the
last time that he was able to reach his favourite Sand-
walk. Shortly after this, his illness became obviously more
serious and alarming, and he was seen by Sir Andrew Clark,
whose treatment was continued by Dr. Norman Moore, of St
Bartholomews Hospital, and Mr. Allfrey, of St. Mary Cray.
He suffered from distressing sensations of exhaustion and
faintness, and seemed to recognise with deep depression the
fact that his working days were over. He gradually recovered
from this condition, and became more cheerful and hopeful, as
is shown in the following letter to Mr. Huxley, who was
anxious that my father should have closer medical supervision
than the existing arrangements allowed :

 My DEAR Huxley,  Your most kind letter has been a real
cordial to me. I have felt better to-day than for three weeks,
and have felt as yet no pain. Your plan seems an excellent
one, and I will probably act upon it, unless I get very much
better. Dr. Clarks kindness is unbounded to me, but he is
too busy to come here. Once again, accept my cordial
thanks, my dear old friend. I wish to God there were more
automata * in the world like you.
Ever yours,
C. Darwin.
CTTXTHR The allusion to Sir Andrew Clark requires a word of ex-
planation. Sir Andrew Clark himself was ever ready to
devote himself to my father, who, however, could not endure
the thought of sending for him, knowing how severely his
great practice taxed his strength.
No especial change occurred during the beginning of April,
but on Saturday 15th he was seized with giddiness while
sitting at dinner in the evening, and fainted in an attempt to
reach his sofa. On the 17th he was again better, and in my
temporary absence recorded for me the progress of an ex-
periment in which I was engaged. During the night of April
1 8th, about a quarter to twelve, he had a severe attack and
passed into a faint, from which he was brought back to
consciousness with great difficulty. He seemed to recognise
the approach of death, and said,  I am not the least afraid
to die. All the next morning he suffered from terrible
nausea and faintness, and hardly rallied before the end
came.
He died at about four oclock on Wednesday, April 19th,
1882.
* CTTXTHR The allusion is to Mr. Huxleys tory, given at the Belfast Meeting
address, On the hypothesis that of the British Association, 1874, and
animals are automata, and its his- republished in Science and Culture.
1 882.] CONCLUSION. 359
I close the record of my father's life with a few words of
retrospect added to the manuscript of his Autobiography
 As for myself, I believe that I have acted rightly in steadily
following and devoting my life to Science. I feel no remorse
from having committed any great sin, but have o ten an
often regretted that I have not done more direct good to my
fellow creatures.

The Funeral in Westminster Abbey.
On the Friday succeeding my fathers death, the following letter,
signed by twenty Members of Parliament, was addressed to Dr.
Bradley, Dean of Westminster :
House of Commons, April si, 1882.
Very Rev. Sir,  We hope you will not think we are taking a
liberty if we venture to suggest that it would be acceptable to a very
large number of our fellow-countrymen of all classes and opinions
that our illustrious countryman, Mr. Darwin, should be buried in
Westminster Abbey.
We remain your obedient servants,
John Lubbock,
Nevil Storey Maskelyne,
A. J. Mundella,
G. O. Trevelyan,
Lyon Playfair,
Charles W. Dilke,
David Wedderburn,
Arthur Russell,
Horace Davey,

Francis W. Buxton,
E. L. Stanley,
Henry Broadhurst,
John Barran,
J. F. Cheetham,
H. S. Holland,
H. Campbell-Bannerman,

Richard Fort.
The Dean was abroad at the time, and telegraphed his cordial
acquiescence.
The family had desired that my father should be buried at Down :
with regard to their wishes, Sir John Lubbock wrote :
APPENDIX L
361
House of Commons, April 25, 1882.
My dear Darwin,  I quite sympathise with your feeling, and
personally I should greatly have preferred that your father should
have rested in Down amongst us alL It is, I am sure, quite under-
stood that the initiative was not taken by you. Still, from a national
point of view, it is dearly right that he should be buried in the Abbey.
I esteem it a great privilege to be allowed to accompany my dear
master to the grave.
W. E. Darwin, Esq.
Believe me, yours most sincerely,
John Lubbock.
The family gave up their first-formed plans, and the funeral took
place in Westminster Abbey on April 26th. The pall-bearers
were :
Sir John Lubbock,
Mr. Huxley,
Mr. James Russell Lowell
(American Minister),
Mr. A. R. Wallace,
The Duke of Devonshire,
Canon Farrar,
Sir Joseph Hooker,
Mr. Wm. Spottiswoode
(President of the Royal
Society),
The Earl of Derby,
The Duke of Argyll
The funeral was attended by the representatives of France,
Germany, Italy, Spain, Russia, and by those of the Universities and
learned Societies, as well as by large numbers of personal friends
and distinguished men.
The grave is in the north aisle of the Nave, dose to the angle of
the choir-screen, and a few feet from the grave of Sir Isaac Newton.
The stone bears the inscription
CHARLES ROBERT DARWIN.
