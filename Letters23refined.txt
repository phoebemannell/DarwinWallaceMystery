<tr><td>CHAPTER I. </td></tr>
<tr><td>THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE ���ORIGIN OF SPECIES.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>[In the first volume, p. 82, the growth of the ��� Origin of Species ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>has been briefly described in my father���s words. The letters </td></tr>
<tr><td>given in the present and following chapters will illustrate and </td></tr>
<tr><td>amplify the history thus sketched out. </td></tr>
<tr><td>It is clear that, in the early part of the voyage of the Beagle </td></tr>
<tr><td>he did not feel it inconsistent with his views to express him- </td></tr>
<tr><td>self in thoroughly orthodox language as to the genesis of new </td></tr>
<tr><td>species. Thus in 1834 he wrote* at Valparaiso: ���I have </td></tr>
<tr><td>already found beds of recent shells yet retaining their colour </td></tr>
<tr><td>at an elevation of 1300 feet, and beneath the level country is </td></tr>
<tr><td>strewn with them. It seems not a very improbable conjecture </td></tr>
<tr><td>that the want of animals may be owing to none having been </td></tr>
<tr><td>created since this country was raised from the sea.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>This pcissage does not occur in the published ���Journal,��� the </td></tr>
<tr><td>last proof of which was finished in 1837 ; and this fact har- </td></tr>
<tr><td>monizes with the change we know to have been proceeding in </td></tr>
<tr><td>his views. But in the published ���Journal ��� we find passages </td></tr>
<tr><td>which show a point of view more in accordance with orthodox </td></tr>

<tr><td>2 THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE ���ORIGIN OF SPECIES.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>theological natural history than with his later views. Thus, </td></tr>
<tr><td>in speaking of the birds Synallaxis and Scytalopus (ist edit </td></tr>
<tr><td>p. 3S3 ; 2nd edit p. 289), he says: ���When finding, as in </td></tr>
<tr><td>this case, any animal which seems to play so insignificant </td></tr>
<tr><td>a part in the great scheme of nature, one is apt to wonder </td></tr>
<tr><td>why a distinct species should have been created.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>A comparison of the two editions of the ���Journal��� is in- </td></tr>
<tr><td>structive, as giving some idea of the development of his </td></tr>
<tr><td>views on evolution. It does not give us a true index of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the mass of conjecture which was taking shape in his mind, </td></tr>
<tr><td>but it shows us that he felt sure enough of the truth of his </td></tr>
<tr><td>belief to allow a stronger tinge of evolution to appear in </td></tr>
<tr><td>the second edition. He has mentioned in the Autobiography </td></tr>
<tr><td>(p. 83), that it was not until he read Malthus that he got a </td></tr>
<tr><td>clear view of the potency of natural selection. This was in </td></tr>
<tr><td>1838 ��� a year after he finished the first edition (it was not </td></tr>
<tr><td>published until 1839), and seven years before the second edition </td></tr>
<tr><td>was written (1845). Thus the turning-point in the formation </td></tr>
<tr><td>of his theory took place between the writing of the two </td></tr>
<tr><td>editions. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I will first give a few passages which are practically the </td></tr>
<tr><td>same in the two editions, and which are, therefore, chiefly of </td></tr>
<tr><td>interest as illustrating his frame of mind in 1837. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The case of the two species of Molothrus (ist edit. p. 61 ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>2nd edit p. S 3 ) must have been one of the earliest instances </td></tr>
<tr><td>noticed by him of the existence of representative species ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>a phenomenon which we know (���Autobiography,��� p. 83) struck </td></tr>
<tr><td>him deeply. The discussion on introduced animals (ist edit </td></tr>
<tr><td>p. 139; 2nd edit p. l2o) shows how much he was impressed </td></tr>
<tr><td>by the complicated interdependence of the inhabitants of a </td></tr>
<tr><td>An analogous point of view is given in the discussion </td></tr>
<tr><td>(1st edit p. 98 ; 2nd edit p. 85) of the mistaken belief that </td></tr>
<tr><td>large animals require, for their support, a luxuriant vegeta- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tion ; the incorrectness of this view is illustrated by the com- </td></tr>
<tr><td>THE ���NATURALIST���S VOYAGE.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>parison of the fauna of South Africa and South America, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>the vegetation of the two continents. The interest of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>discussion is that it shows clearly our i priori ignorance of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the conditions of life suitable to any organism. </td></tr>
<tr><td>There is a passage which has been more than once quoted </td></tr>
<tr><td>as bearing on the origin of his views. It is where he dis�� </td></tr>
<tr><td>cusses the striking difference between the species of mice on </td></tr>
<tr><td>the east and west of the Andes (ist edit p. 399) : ��� Unless we </td></tr>
<tr><td>suppose the same species to have been created in two </td></tr>
<tr><td>different countries, we ought not to expect any closer simi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>larity between the organic beings on the opposite sides of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the Andes than on shores separated by a broad strait of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>sea.��� In the 2nd edit p. 327, the passage is almost verbally </td></tr>
<tr><td>identical, and is practically the same. </td></tr>
<tr><td>There are other passages again which are more strongly </td></tr>
<tr><td>evolutionary in the 2nd edit, but otherwise are similar to the </td></tr>
<tr><td>corresponding passages in the 1st edition. Thus, in describing </td></tr>
<tr><td>the blind Tuco-tuco (ist edit. p. 60 ; 2nd edit. p. 52), in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>first edition he makes no allusion to what Lamarck might </td></tr>
<tr><td>have thought, nor is the instance used as an example of </td></tr>
<tr><td>modification, as in the edition of 1845. </td></tr>
<tr><td>A striking passage occurs in the 2nd edit (p. 173) on the </td></tr>
<tr><td>relationship between the ���extinct edentata and the living </td></tr>
<tr><td>sloths, ant-eaters, and armadillos.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� This wonderful relationship in the same continent between </td></tr>
<tr><td>the dead and the living, will, I do not doubt, hereafter throw </td></tr>
<tr><td>more light on the appearance of organic beings on our earth, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and their disappearance from it, than any other class of facts.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>This sentence does not occur in the 1st edit, but he was </td></tr>
<tr><td>evidently profoundly struck by the disappearance of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>gigantic forerunners of the present animals. The difference </td></tr>
<tr><td>between the discussions in the two editions is most instructive. </td></tr>
<tr><td>In both, our ignorance of the conditions of life is insisted on, </td></tr>
<tr><td>but in the second edition, the discussion is made to lead up to </td></tr>
<tr><td>a strong statement of the intensity of the struggle for life. </td></tr>

<tr><td>O The Comnlete of Charles Darwin Online </td></tr>
<tr><td>4 THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE ���ORIGIN OF SPECIES.' </td></tr>
<tr><td>Then follows a comparison behveen rarity ��� and extinction, </td></tr>
<tr><td>which introduces the idea that the preservation and dominance </td></tr>
<tr><td>of existing species depend on the degree in which they are </td></tr>
<tr><td>adapted to surrounding conditions. In the first edition, he is </td></tr>
<tr><td>merely ��� tempted to believe in such simple relations as varia- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tion of climate and food, or introduction of enemies, or the </td></tr>
<tr><td>increased number of other species, as the .cause of the succes- </td></tr>
<tr><td>sion of races.��� But finally (1st edit.) he ends the chapter by </td></tr>
<tr><td>comparing the extinction of a species to the exhaustion and </td></tr>
<tr><td>disappearance of varieties of fruit-trees, as though he thought </td></tr>
<tr><td>that a mysterious term of life was impressed on each species </td></tr>
<tr><td>at its creation. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The difference of treatment of the Galapagos problem is of </td></tr>
<tr><td>some interest In the earlier book, the American type of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>productions of the islands is noticed, as is the fact that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>different islands possess forms specially their own, but the </td></tr>
<tr><td>importance of the whole problem is not so strongly put </td></tr>
<tr><td>forward. Thus, in the first edition, he merely says : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>"This similarity of type between distant islands and con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tinents, while the species are distinct, has scarcely been </td></tr>
<tr><td>sufficiently noticed. The circumstance would be explained, </td></tr>
<tr><td>according to the views of some authors, by saying that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>creative power had acted according to the same law over a </td></tr>
<tr><td>wide area.��� ��� (ist edit. p. 474.) </td></tr>
<tr><td>This passage is not given in the second edition, and the </td></tr>
<tr><td>generalisations on geographical distribution are much wider </td></tr>
<tr><td>and fuller. Thus he asks : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>" Why were their aboriginal inhabitants, associated ... in </td></tr>
<tr><td>different proportions both in kind and number from those </td></tr>
<tr><td>on the Continent, and therefore acting on each other in a </td></tr>
<tr><td>different manner ��� why were they created on American types </td></tr>
<tr><td>of organisation ?��� ��� (2nd edit. p. 393-) </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� In the second edition, p. 146, of our ignorance of the causes of </td></tr>

<tr><td>edition (p. 461) without comment. Whereas in the second </td></tr>

<tr><td>find with a strong sense of surprise how far developed were </td></tr>
<tr><td>his views in 1837. We are enabled to form an opinion on </td></tr>
<tr><td>this point from the note-books in which he wrote down </td></tr>
<tr><td>detached thoughts and queries. I shall quote from the first </td></tr>
<tr><td>note-book, completed between July 1837 and February </td></tr>
<tr><td>1 838 : and this is the more worth doing, as it gives us an </td></tr>
<tr><td>insight into the condition of his thoughts before the reading </td></tr>
<tr><td>of Malthus. The notes are written in his most hurried style, </td></tr>
<tr><td>so many words being omitted, that it is often difficult to </td></tr>

<tr><td>square brackets)* I have printed the extracts as written ; the </td></tr>

<tr><td>The two following extracts show that he applied the theory </td></tr>
<tr><td>of evolution to the "whole organic kingdom��� from plants to </td></tr>

<tr><td>Here we see that the case of domestic animals was already </td></tr>
<tr><td>present in his mind as bearing on the production of natural </td></tr>
<tr><td>species. The disappearance of intermediate forms naturally </td></tr>
<tr><td>leads up to the subject of extinction, with which the next </td></tr>
<tr><td>extract begins. </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� It is a wonderful fact, horse, elephant, and mastodon, </td></tr>
<tr><td>dying out about same time in such different quarters. </td></tr>
<tr><td>���Will Mr. Lyell say that some [same?] circumstance killed </td></tr>

<tr><td>���Why does individual die.��� To perpetuate certain peculi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>arities (therefore adaptation), and obliterate accidental varieties, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and to accommodate itself to change (for, of course, change, </td></tr>
<tr><td>even in varieties, is accommodation). Now this argument </td></tr>
<tr><td>applies to species. </td></tr>

<tr><td>between associated and non-associated animals ��� and the story </td></tr>

<tr><td>selection : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� With respect to extinction, we can easily see that [a] </td></tr>
<tr><td>variety of [the] ostrich (Petise), may not be well adapted, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and thus perish out ; or, on the other hand, like Orpheus [a </td></tr>
<tr><td>Galapagos bird], being favourable, many might be produced. </td></tr>
<tr><td>This requires [the] principle that the permanent variations </td></tr>
<tr><td>produced by confined breeding and changing circumstances </td></tr>
<tr><td>arc continued and produce[d] according io the adaptation of </td></tr>
<tr><td>such circumstances, and therefore that death of species is a </td></tr>
<tr><td>consequence (contrary to what would appear from America) </td></tr>
<tr><td>of non-adaptation of circumstances.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>The first part of the next extract has a similar bearing. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The end of the passage is of much interest, as showing that </td></tr>
<tr><td>he had at this early date visions of the far-reaching character </td></tr>
<tr><td>of his speculations : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� With belief of transmutation and geographical grouping, </td></tr>

<tr><td>the concluding sentence of the ��� Origin of Species ��� : * ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� Before the attraction of gravity discovered it might have </td></tr>
<tr><td>been said it was as great a difficulty to account for the </td></tr>
<tr><td>movement of all [planets] by one law, as to account for each </td></tr>
<tr><td>separate one ; so to say that all mammalia were born from </td></tr>
<tr><td>one stock, and since distributed by such means as we can </td></tr>
<tr><td>recognise, may be thought to explain nothing. </td></tr>
<tr><td>���Astronomers might formerly have said that God fore- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ordered each planet to move in its particular destiny. In the </td></tr>
<tr><td>same manner God orders each animal created with certain </td></tr>
<tr><td>forms in certain countries ; but how much more simple and </td></tr>

<tr><td>theory of the relation between alpine plants in various parts </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the world, in the publication of which he was forestalled </td></tr>

<tr><td>(still therefore before the second edition of the ���Journal��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>was completed), we find an enormous advance made on the </td></tr>
<tr><td>note-book of 1837. The Sketch is in fact a surprisingly com- </td></tr>

<tr><td>in the ��� Origin of Species.��� There is some obscurity as to the </td></tr>
<tr><td>date of the short Sketch which formed the basis of the 1844 </td></tr>
<tr><td>Essay. We know from his own words (Vol. I. p. 184), that it </td></tr>
<tr><td>was in June 1842 that he first wrote out a short sketch of </td></tr>
<tr><td>his views.* This statement is given with so much circum- </td></tr>
<tr><td>stance that it is almost Impossible to suppose that it contains </td></tr>

<tr><td>It is to the following effect : ���This was sketched in 1839, and </td></tr>

<tr><td>was sent to Sir J. D. Hooker (see Letter of June 29, 1858, </td></tr>
<tr><td>Vol. II. p. 1 19). There is also some further evidence on this side </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the question. Writing to Mr. Wallace (Jan. 25, 1859) my </td></tr>
<tr><td>father says : ��� ��� Every one whom I have seen has thought </td></tr>
<tr><td>your paper very well written and interesting. It puts my </td></tr>
<tr><td>extracts (written in 1839, now just twenty years ago !), which </td></tr>
<tr><td>I must say in apology were never for an instant intended for </td></tr>

<tr><td>sketch was written in 1839 has been frequently made in </td></tr>
<tr><td>biographical notices of my father, no doubt on the authority </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the ��� Linnean Journal,��� but it must, I think, be considered </td></tr>
<tr><td>as erroneous. The error may possibly have arisen in this </td></tr>
<tr><td>way. In writing on the Table of Contents of the 1844 MS. </td></tr>
<tr><td>that it was sketched in 1839, I think my father may have </td></tr>
<tr><td>intended to imply that the framework of the theory was clearly </td></tr>
<tr><td>thought out by him at that date. In the Autobiography </td></tr>
<tr><td>(p. 88) he speaks of the time, ��� about 1839, when the theory </td></tr>
<tr><td>was clearly conceived,��� meaning, no doubt, the end of 1838 </td></tr>
<tr><td>and beginning of 1839, when the reading of Malthus had </td></tr>

<tr><td>hundred and thirty-one pages folio, blank leaves being </td></tr>
<tr><td>alternated with the MS. with a view to amplification. The </td></tr>
<tr><td>text has been revised and corrected, criticisms being pencilled </td></tr>
<tr><td>by himself on the margin. It is divided into two parts : I. ��� On </td></tr>
<tr><td>the variation of Organic Beings under Domestication and in </td></tr>
<tr><td>their Natural State.��� II. ���On the Evidence favourable and </td></tr>
<tr><td>opposed to the view that Species are naturally formed races </td></tr>

<tr><td>the argument of that work, on the study of domestic animals, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and both the Sketch and the ��� Origin ��� open with a chapter </td></tr>
<tr><td>on variation under domestication and on artificial selection. </td></tr>
<tr><td>This is followed, in both essays, by discussions on variation </td></tr>

<tr><td>the chapters which deal with variation in structure. It seems </td></tr>
<tr><td>to have been placed thus early in the Essay to prevent the </td></tr>

<tr><td>PRINCIPLE OF DIVERGENCE. </td></tr>
<tr><td>In the Autobiography (Vol. I. p. 84) my father has stated </td></tr>
<tr><td>what seemed to him the chief flaw of the 1844 Sketch; he </td></tr>
<tr><td>had overlooked ���one problem of great importance,��� the </td></tr>
<tr><td>problem of the divergence of character. This point is dis- </td></tr>
<tr><td>cussed in the ��� Origin of Species,��� but, as it may not be familiar </td></tr>
<tr><td>to all readers, I will give a short account of the difficulty and </td></tr>
<tr><td>its solution. The author begins by stating that varieties </td></tr>
<tr><td>differ from each other less than species, and then goes on : </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� Nevertheless, according to my view, varieties are species in </td></tr>
<tr><td>process of formation How then does the lesser dif- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ference between varieties become augmented into the greater </td></tr>
<tr><td>difference between species.��� * He shows how an analogous </td></tr>
<tr><td>divergence takes place under domestication where an originally </td></tr>
<tr><td>uniform stock of horses has been split up into race-horses, </td></tr>
<tr><td>dray-horses, &c., and then goes on to explain how the same </td></tr>
<tr><td>principle applies to natural species. ���From the simple </td></tr>
<tr><td>circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from </td></tr>
<tr><td>any one species become in structure, constitution, and habits, </td></tr>
<tr><td>by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and </td></tr>
<tr><td>widely diversified places in the polity of nature, and so be </td></tr>
<tr><td>enabled to increase in numbers.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>The principle is exemplified by the fact that if on one plot </td></tr>
<tr><td>of ground a single variety of wheat be sown, and on to </td></tr>
<tr><td>another a mixture of varieties, in the latter case the produce </td></tr>
<tr><td>is greater. More individuals have been able to exist because </td></tr>
<tr><td>they were not all of the same variety. An organism becomes </td></tr>
<tr><td>more perfect and more fitted to survive when by division </td></tr>
<tr><td>of labour the different functions of life are performed by </td></tr>
<tr><td>different organs. In the same way a species becomes more </td></tr>
<tr><td>efficient and more able to survive when different sections of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the species become differentiated so as to fiil different stations. </td></tr>
<tr><td>In reading the Sketch of 1844, I have found it difficult to </td></tr>
<tr><td>recognise, as a flaw in the Essay, the absence of any definite </td></tr>
<tr><td>statement of the principle of divergence. Descent with </td></tr>

<tr><td>modification implies divergence, and we become so habituated </td></tr>
<tr><td>to a belief in descent, and therefore in divergence, that we </td></tr>
<tr><td>do not notice the absence of proof that divergence is in itself </td></tr>
<tr><td>an advantage. As shown in the Autobiography, my father </td></tr>
<tr><td>in 1876 found it hardly credible that he should have over- </td></tr>
<tr><td>looked the problem and its solution. </td></tr>

<tr><td>years before, but who had not, I believe, since met him. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I was introduced ; the interview was of course brief, and the </td></tr>

<tr><td>of a rather tall and rather broad-shouldered man, with </td></tr>
<tr><td>a slight stoop, an agreeable and animated expression when </td></tr>
<tr><td>talking, beetle brows, and a hollow but mellow voice ; and </td></tr>
<tr><td>tliat his greeting of his old acquaintance was sailor-like ��� </td></tr>

<tr><td>for I was already aware of his attainments and labours, derived </td></tr>
<tr><td>from having read various proof-sheets of his then unpublished </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� Journal.��� These had been submitted to Mr. (afterwards Sir. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Charles) Lyell by Mr. Danvin, and by him sent to his father, </td></tr>
<tr><td>Ch. Lyell, Esq., of Kinnordy, who (being a very old friend of </td></tr>

<tr><td>, . . The conclusion, which I have come at is, that those </td></tr>

<tr><td>organic beings, appears to me to indicate, is that isolation is </td></tr>
<tr><td>the chief .concomitant or cause of the appearance of 7iew </td></tr>
<tr><td>forms (I well know there are some staring exceptions). </td></tr>
<tr><td>Secondly, from seeing how often the plants and animals </td></tr>

<tr><td>ing what] a vast number of plants will live, for instance in </td></tr>
<tr><td>England, if kept free from weeds, and native plants, I have </td></tr>

<tr><td>features, than on the number of forms, which have been there </td></tr>
<tr><td>originally created or produced. I much doubt whether you </td></tr>

<tr><td>present varieties; The definition I should give of a ''close </td></tr>
<tr><td>species" was one that you thought specifically distinct, but </td></tr>
<tr><td>which you could conceive some other good botanist might </td></tr>
<tr><td>think only a race or variety ; or, again, a species that you </td></tr>

<tr><td>As you say you would like to hear my reasons for being </td></tr>
<tr><td>most unwilling to believe in the continental extensions of late </td></tr>
<tr><td>authors, I gladly write them, as, without 1 am convinced of </td></tr>
<tr><td>my error, I shall have to give them condensed in my essay, </td></tr>

<tr><td>reason to admit a continental extension in any one or two </td></tr>
<tr><td>instances (as in Madeira) than in other cases, I should feel no- </td></tr>
<tr><td>difficulty whatever. But if on account of European plants, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and littoral sea shells, it is thought necessary to join Madeira </td></tr>
<tr><td>to the mainland. Hooker is quite right to join New Holland </td></tr>
<tr><td>to New Zealand, and Auckland Island (and Raoul Island to </td></tr>
<tr><td>N.E.), and these to S. America and the Falklands, and these </td></tr>
<tr><td>to Tristan d���Acunha, and these to Kerguelen Land ; thus </td></tr>
<tr><td>making, either strictly at the same time, or at different periods, </td></tr>
<tr><td>but all within the life of recent beings, an almost circumpolar </td></tr>
<tr><td>belt of land. So again Galapagos and Juan Fernandez must </td></tr>

<tr><td>Galapagos must have been joined to the Pacific Islands (2400 </td></tr>
<tr><td>miles distant) as well as to America, and as Woodward seems </td></tr>
<tr><td>to think all the islands in the Pacific into a magnificent con- </td></tr>

<tr><td>7S- </td></tr>
<tr><td>across the ocean to the Azores, and further north right across. </td></tr>
<tr><td>In short, we must suppose probably, half the present ocean </td></tr>
<tr><td>was land within the period of living organisms. The Globe </td></tr>
<tr><td>within this period must have had a quite different aspect. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Now the only way to test this, that I can see, is to consider </td></tr>
<tr><td>whether the continents have undergone within this same pe- </td></tr>
<tr><td>riod such wonderful permutations. In all North and South </td></tr>
<tr><td>and Central America, we have both recent and miocene (or </td></tr>
<tr><td>eocene) shells, quite distinct on the opposite sides, and hence </td></tr>
<tr><td>I cannot doubt that fundamentally America has held its place </td></tr>
<tr><td>since at least, the miocene period. In Africa almost all the </td></tr>
<tr><td>living shells are distinct on the opposite sides of the inter- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tropical regions, short as the distance is compared to the range </td></tr>
<tr><td>of marine mollusca, in uninterrupted seas ; hence I infer that </td></tr>
<tr><td>Africa has e.xisted since our present species were created. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Even the isthmus of Suez and the Aralo-Caspian basin have </td></tr>
<tr><td>had a great antiquity. So I imagine, from the tertiary depos- </td></tr>
<tr><td>its, has India. In Australia the great fauna of extinct mar- </td></tr>
<tr><td>supials shows that before the present mammals appeared, </td></tr>
<tr><td>Australia was a separate continent. I do not for one second </td></tr>
<tr><td>doubt that very large portions of all these continents have </td></tr>
<tr><td>undergone great changes of level within this period, but yet I </td></tr>
<tr><td>conclude that fundamentally they stood as barriers in the sea, </td></tr>
<tr><td>where they now stand ; and therefore I should require the </td></tr>
<tr><td>weightiest evidence to make me believe in such immense </td></tr>
<tr><td>changes within the period of living organisms in our oceans, </td></tr>
<tr><td>where, moreover, from the great depths, the changes must </td></tr>
<tr><td>have been vaster in a vertical sense. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Secondly. Submerge our present continents, leaving a few </td></tr>
<tr><td>mountain peaks as islands, and what will the character of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>islands be ? ��� Consider that the Pyrenees, Sierra Nevada, </td></tr>
<tr><td>Apennines, Alps, Carpathians, are non-volcanic, Etna and </td></tr>

<tr><td>and Itacolumi of Brazil, further south the Sierra jVentanas, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and in the Cordilleras, many volcanic but not all. Now </td></tr>

<tr><td>in the line of Madagascar ; the Falklands, only 500 miles off, </td></tr>
<tr><td>are only a shallow bank ; New Caledonia, hardly oceanic, is </td></tr>
<tr><td>another exception. This argument has to me great weight </td></tr>
<tr><td>Compare on a Geographical Map, islands which, we have </td></tr>

<tr><td>Sardinia, and how different it appears. Believing, as I am </td></tr>
<tr><td>inclined, that continents as continents, and oceans as oceans, </td></tr>
<tr><td>are. of immense antiquity ��� I should say that if any of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>existing oceanic islands have any relation of any kind to </td></tr>
<tr><td>continents, they are forming continents ; and that by the </td></tr>
<tr><td>time they could form a continent, the volcanoes would be </td></tr>
<tr><td>denuded to their cores, leaving peaks of syenite, diorite, or </td></tr>
<tr><td>porphyry. But have we nowhere any last wreck of a con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tinent, in the midst of the ocean ? St. Paul���s Rock, and such </td></tr>

<tr><td>my Coral volume has any truth in it, viz. : that volcanic </td></tr>
<tr><td>outbursts accompany rising areas), for during subsidence </td></tr>
<tr><td>there will be no compensating agent at work, in rising areas </td></tr>

<tr><td>amount of subsidence, but I must strike my colours. With </td></tr>
<tr><td>respect to coral reefs, I carefully guarded against its being </td></tr>
<tr><td>�� The Complete Work of Charles Darwin Online </td></tr>

<tr><td>supposed that a continent was indicated by the groups of </td></tr>
<tr><td>atolls. It is difficult to guess, as it seems to me, the </td></tr>
<tr><td>amount of subsidence indicated by coral reefs ; but in such </td></tr>
<tr><td>large areas as the Lowe Archipelago, the Marshall Archi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>pelago, and Laccadive group, it would, judging from the </td></tr>
<tr><td>heights of existing oceanic archipelagoes, be odd, if some </td></tr>
<tr><td>peaks of from 8000 to 10,000 feet had not been buried. Even </td></tr>
<tr><td>after your letter a suspicion crossed me whether it would bo </td></tr>
<tr><td>fair to argue from subsidences in the middle of the greatest </td></tr>
<tr><td>oceans to continents ; but refreshing my memory by talking </td></tr>
<tr><td>with Ramsay in regard to the probable thickness in one vertical </td></tr>
<tr><td>line of the Silurian and carboniferous formation, it seems there </td></tr>
<tr><td>must have been at least 10,000 feet of subsidence during these </td></tr>
<tr><td>formations in Europe and North America, and therefore </td></tr>
<tr><td>during the continuance of nearly the same set of organic </td></tr>
<tr><td>beings. But even 1 2,000 feet would not be enough for the </td></tr>
<tr><td>Azores, or for Hooker���s continent ; I believe Hooker does not </td></tr>
<tr><td>infer a continuous continent, but approximate groups of </td></tr>
<tr><td>islands, with, if we may judge from existing continents, not </td></tr>
<tr><td>profoundly deep sea between them ; but the argument from </td></tr>
<tr><td>the volcanic nature of nearly every existing oceanic island </td></tr>
<tr><td>tells against such supposed groups of islands, ��� for I presume </td></tr>
<tr><td>he does not suppose a mere chain of volcanic islands belting </td></tr>
<tr><td>the southern hemisphere. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Fourthly. The supposed continental extensions do not seem </td></tr>
<tr><td>to me, perfectly to account for all the phenomena of distri- </td></tr>
<tr><td>bution on islands ; as the absence of mammals and Batra- </td></tr>
<tr><td>chians ; the absence of certain great groups of insects on </td></tr>

<tr><td>the paucity of plants in some cases, &c. Not that those who </td></tr>

<tr><td>Nineteen years (!) ago it occurred to me that whilst otherwise </td></tr>
<tr><td>employed on Nat. Hist., I might perhaps do good if I noted </td></tr>
<tr><td>any sort of facts bearing on the question of the origin of </td></tr>
<tr><td>species, and this I have since been doing. Either species </td></tr>
<tr><td>have been independently created, or they have descended </td></tr>
<tr><td>from other species, like varieties from one species. I think it </td></tr>
<tr><td>can be shown to be probable that man gets his most distinct </td></tr>
<tr><td>varieties by preserving such as arise best worth keeping and </td></tr>
<tr><td>destroying the others, but I should fill a quire if I were to go </td></tr>
<tr><td>on. To be brief, I assume that species arise like our domestic </td></tr>
<tr><td>varieties with much extinction ; and then test this hypothesis </td></tr>
<tr><td>by comparison with as many general and pretty well-esta- </td></tr>
<tr><td>blished propositions as I can find made out, ��� in geographical </td></tr>
<tr><td>�� The Complete Work of Charles Darwin Online </td></tr>
<tr><td>1856.] GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION. 79 </td></tr>
<tr><td>distribution, geological history, affinities, &c. &c. And it </td></tr>
<tr><td>seems to me that, supposing that such hypothesis were to </td></tr>
<tr><td>explain such general propositions, we ought, in accordance </td></tr>
<tr><td>with the common way of following all sciences, to admit it till </td></tr>
<tr><td>some better hypothesis be found out. For to my mind to </td></tr>
<tr><td>say that species were created so and so is no scientific explan- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ation, only a reverent way of saying it is so and so. But it </td></tr>
<tr><td>is nonsensical trying to show how I try to proceed, in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>compass of a note. But as an honest man, I must tell you that </td></tr>
<tr><td>I have come to the heterodox conclusion, that there are no </td></tr>
<tr><td>such things as independently created species ��� that species are </td></tr>
<tr><td>only strongly defined varieties. I know that this will make </td></tr>
<tr><td>you despise me. I do not much underrate the many huge </td></tr>
<tr><td>difficulties on this view, but yet it seems to me to explain too </td></tr>
<tr><td>much, otherwise inexplicable, to be false. Just to allude to </td></tr>
<tr><td>one point in your last note, viz. about species of the same </td></tr>
<tr><td>genus getierally having a common or continuous area ; if they </td></tr>
<tr><td>are actual lineal descendants of one species, this of course </td></tr>
<tr><td>would be the case ; and the sadly too many exceptions (for </td></tr>
<tr><td>me) have to be explained by climatal and geological changes. </td></tr>
<tr><td>A fortiori on this view (but on exactly same grounds), all the </td></tr>
<tr><td>individuals of the same species should have a continuous </td></tr>
<tr><td>distribution. On this latter branch of the subject I have put </td></tr>
<tr><td>a chapter together, and Hooker kindly read it over. I </td></tr>
<tr><td>thought the exceptions and difficulties were so great that on </td></tr>
<tr><td>the whole the balance weighed against my notions, but I was </td></tr>
<tr><td>much pleased to find that it seemed to have considerable </td></tr>
<tr><td>weight with Hooker, who said he had never been so much </td></tr>
<tr><td>staggered about the permanence of species. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I must say one word more in justification (for I feel sure </td></tr>
<tr><td>that your tendency will be to despise me and my crotchets), </td></tr>
<tr><td>that all my notions about how species change are derived </td></tr>

<tr><td>e.xtemal conditions (to which naturalists so often appeal) do </td></tr>
<tr><td>by themselves very little. How much they do is the point of </td></tr>

<tr><td>the facts of variation under domestication, and I may yet get </td></tr>
<tr><td>more light. But at present, after drawing up a rough copy </td></tr>
<tr><td>on this subject, my conclusion is that external conditions do </td></tr>
<tr><td>extremely little, except in causing mere variability. This </td></tr>
<tr><td>mere variability (causing the child not closely to resemble its </td></tr>
<tr><td>parent) I look at as very different from the formation of a </td></tr>
<tr><td>marked variety or new species. (No doubt the variability is </td></tr>
<tr><td>governed by laws, some of which I am endeavouring very </td></tr>
<tr><td>obscurely to trace.) The formation of a strong variety or </td></tr>
<tr><td>species I look at as almost wholly due to the selection of </td></tr>
<tr><td>what may be incorrectly called variations or variability. </td></tr>
<tr><td>This power of selection stands in the most direct relation to </td></tr>
<tr><td>time, and in the state of nature can be only excessively slow. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Again, the slight differences selected, by which a race or </td></tr>
<tr><td>species is at last formed, stands, as I think can be shown </td></tr>
<tr><td>.(even with plants, and obviously with animals), in a far more </td></tr>
<tr><td>important relation to its associates than to external conditions. </td></tr>

<tr><td>perhaps, think it paltry in me, when I ask you not to mention </td></tr>
<tr><td>my doctrine ; the reason is, if any one, like the author of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� Vestiges,��� were to hear of them, he might easily work them </td></tr>
<tr><td>in, and then I should have to quote from a work perhaps </td></tr>
<tr><td>despised by naturalists, and this would greatly injure any </td></tr>
<tr><td>chance of my views being received by those alone whose </td></tr>
<tr><td>opinions I value. [Here follows a discussion on ���large </td></tr>
<tr><td>genera varying,��� which has no direct connection with the </td></tr>
<tr><td>remainder of the letter.] </td></tr>
<tr><td>I. It is wonderful what the principle of Selection by Man, </td></tr>
<tr><td>that is the picking out of individuals with any desired quality, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and breeding from them, and again picking out, can do. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Even breeders have been astonished at their own results. </td></tr>
<tr><td>They can act on differences inappreciable to an uneducated </td></tr>
<tr><td>eye. Selection has been metlwdically followed in Europe for </td></tr>
<tr><td>only the last half century. But it has occasionally, and even </td></tr>
<tr><td>in some degree methodically, been followed in the most </td></tr>
<tr><td>ancient times. There must have been also a kind of uncon- </td></tr>
<tr><td>scious selection from the most ancient times, namely, in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>preservation of the individual animals (without any thought of </td></tr>
<tr><td>their offspring) most useful to each race of man in his par- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ticular circumstances. The ��� roguing,��� as nursery-men call the </td></tr>
<tr><td>destroying of varieties, which depart from their type, is a kind </td></tr>
<tr><td>of selection. I am convinced that intentional and occasional </td></tr>
<tr><td>selection has been the main agent in making our domestic </td></tr>
<tr><td>races. But, however this may be, its great power of modifi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>cation has been indisputably shown in late times. Selection </td></tr>
<tr><td>acts only by the accumulation of very slight or greater </td></tr>
<tr><td>variations, caused by external conditions, or by the mere </td></tr>
<tr><td>fact that in generation the child is not absolutely similar to </td></tr>
<tr><td>its parent. Man, by this power of accumulating variations, </td></tr>
<tr><td>adapts living beings to his wants ��� he may be said to make </td></tr>

<tr><td>the wool of one sheep good for carpets, and another for </td></tr>
<tr><td>cloth, &c. </td></tr>
<tr><td>II. Now, suppose there was a being, who did not judge by- </td></tr>
<tr><td>mere external appearance, but could study the whole internal </td></tr>
<tr><td>organisation ��� who never was capricious ��� who should go on </td></tr>
<tr><td>selecting for one end during millions of generations, who will </td></tr>
<tr><td>say what he might not effect 1 In nature we have some slight </td></tr>
<tr><td>variations, occasionally in all parts ; and I think it can be </td></tr>
<tr><td>shown that a change in the conditions of existence is the </td></tr>
<tr><td>main cause of the child not exactly resembling its parents ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>and in nature, geology shows us what changes have taken </td></tr>
<tr><td>place, and are taking place. We have almost unlimited time ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>no one but a practical geologist can fully appreciate this : </td></tr>
<tr><td>think of the Glacial period, during the whole of which the </td></tr>
<tr><td>same species of shells at least have existed ; there must </td></tr>
<tr><td>have been during this period, millions on millions of </td></tr>
<tr><td>generations. </td></tr>
<tr><td>III. I think it can be shown that there is such an unerring </td></tr>
<tr><td>power at work, or Natural Selection (the title of my book), </td></tr>
<tr><td>which selects exclusively for the good of each organic being. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The elder De Candolle, W. Herbert, and Lyell, have written </td></tr>
<tr><td>strongly on the struggle for life; but even they have not </td></tr>
<tr><td>written strongly enough. Reflect that every being (even the </td></tr>
<tr><td>elephant) breeds at such a rate that, in a few years, or at most </td></tr>
<tr><td>a few centuries or thousands of years, the surface of the earth </td></tr>
<tr><td>would not hold the progeny of any one species. I have found </td></tr>
<tr><td>it hard constantly to bear in mind that the increase of every </td></tr>
<tr><td>single species is checked during some part of its life, or during </td></tr>
<tr><td>some shortly recurrent generation. Only a few of those </td></tr>
<tr><td>annually born can live to propagate their kind. What a </td></tr>
<tr><td>trifling difference must often determine which shall survive </td></tr>
<tr><td>and which perish 1 </td></tr>
<tr><td>IV. Now take the case of a country undergoing some </td></tr>
<tr><td>change ; this will tend to cause some of its inhabitants to vary </td></tr>
<tr><td>slightly ; not but what I believe most beings vary at all times </td></tr>
<tr><td>�� The Comolete Work of Charles Darwin Online </td></tr>
<tr><td>124 the writing of the ���origin of species.��� [1858. </td></tr>
<tr><td>enough for selection to act on. Some of its inhabitants will </td></tr>
<tr><td>be exterminated, and the remainder will be exposed to the </td></tr>
<tr><td>mutual action of a different set of inhabitants, which I believe </td></tr>
<tr><td>to be more important to the life of each being than mere </td></tr>
<tr><td>climate. Considering the infinitely various ways beings have </td></tr>
<tr><td>to obtain food by struggling with other beings, to escape </td></tr>
<tr><td>danger at various times of life, to have their eggs or seeds </td></tr>
<tr><td>disseminated, &c. &c., I cannot doubt that during millions of </td></tr>
<tr><td>generations individuals of a species will be born with some </td></tr>
<tr><td>slight variation profitable to some part of its economy ; such </td></tr>
<tr><td>will have a better chance of surviving, propagating this varia- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tion, which again will be slowly increased by the accumulative </td></tr>
<tr><td>action of natural selection ; and the variety thus formed will </td></tr>
<tr><td>either coexist with, or more commonly will exterminate its </td></tr>
<tr><td>parent form. An organic being like the woodpecker, or </td></tr>
<tr><td>the mistletoe, may thus come to be adapted to a score of </td></tr>
<tr><td>contingencies ; natural selection, accumulating those slight </td></tr>
<tr><td>variations in all parts of its structure which are in any way </td></tr>
<tr><td>useful to it, during any part of its life. </td></tr>
<tr><td>V. Multiform difficulties will occur to every one on this </td></tr>
<tr><td>theory. Most can, I think, be satisfactorily answered. ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>Natura non facit saltum ��� answer some of the most obvi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ous. The slowness of the change, and only a very few under- </td></tr>
<tr><td>going change at any one time answers others. The extreme </td></tr>
<tr><td>imperfections of our geological records answer others. </td></tr>
<tr><td>VI. One other principle, which maybe called the principle </td></tr>
<tr><td>of divergence, plays, I believe, an important part in the origin </td></tr>
<tr><td>of species. The same spot will support more life if occupied </td></tr>
<tr><td>by very diverse forms : we see this in the many generic forms </td></tr>
<tr><td>in a square yard of turf (I have counted twenty species </td></tr>
<tr><td>belonging to eighteen genera), or in the plants and insects, </td></tr>
<tr><td>on any little uniform islet, belonging to almost as many </td></tr>
<tr><td>genera and families as to species. We can understand this </td></tr>
<tr><td>with the higher animals, whose habits we best understand. </td></tr>
<tr><td>We know that it has been experimentally shown that a plot </td></tr>
<tr><td>1858.] THE LETTER TO DR. GRAY. 12$ </td></tr>
<tr><td>of land will yield a greater weight, if cropped with several </td></tr>
<tr><td>species of grasses, than with two or three species. Now every </td></tr>
<tr><td>single organic being, by propagating rapidly, may be said to </td></tr>
<tr><td>be striving its utmost to increase in numbers. So it will be </td></tr>
<tr><td>with the offspring of any species after it has broken into </td></tr>
<tr><td>varieties, or sub-species, or true species. And it follows, I </td></tr>
<tr><td>think, from the foregoing facts, that the varying offspring of </td></tr>
<tr><td>each species will try (only few will succeed) to seize on as </td></tr>
<tr><td>many and as diverse places in the economy of nature as </td></tr>
<tr><td>possible. Each new variety or species when formed will </td></tr>
<tr><td>generally take the place of, and so exterminate its less well- </td></tr>
<tr><td>fitted parent This, I believe, to be the origin of the classifi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>cation or arrangement of all organic beings at all times. </td></tr>
<tr><td>These always seem to branch and sub-branch like a tree </td></tr>
<tr><td>from a common trunk ; the flourishing twigs destroying the </td></tr>
<tr><td>less vigorous ��� the dead and lost branches rudely representing </td></tr>
<tr><td>extinct genera and families. </td></tr>
<tr><td>This sketch is most imperfect ; but in so short a space I </td></tr>
<tr><td>cannot make it better. Your imagination must fill up many </td></tr>
<tr><td>wide blanks. Without some reflection, it will appear all </td></tr>
<tr><td>rubbish ; perhaps it will appear so after reflection. </td></tr>
<tr><td>C. D. </td></tr>
<tr><td>P.S. ��� This little abstract touches only the accumulative </td></tr>
<tr><td>power of natural selection, which I look at as by far the most </td></tr>
<tr><td>important element in the production of new forms. The laws </td></tr>

<tr><td>My dear Gray, ��� Your note of July 27th has just reached </td></tr>
<tr><td>me in the Isle of Wight. It is a real and great pleasure to me </td></tr>
<tr><td>to write to you about my notions ; and even if it were not so, </td></tr>
<tr><td>I should be a most ungrateful dog, after all the invalu- </td></tr>
<tr><td>able assistance which you have rendered me, if I did not do </td></tr>
<tr><td>anything which you asked. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I have discussed in my long MS. the later changes of </td></tr>
<tr><td>climate and the effect on migration, and I will here give you </td></tr>
<tr><td>an abstract of an abstract (which latter I am preparing of </td></tr>
<tr><td>my whole work for the Linnean Society). I cannot give </td></tr>
<tr><td>you facts, and I must write dogmatically, though I do not </td></tr>
<tr><td>feel so on any point. I may just mention, in order that you </td></tr>
<tr><td>may believe that I have some foundation for my views, that </td></tr>
<tr><td>Hooker has read my MS., and though he at first demurred to </td></tr>
<tr><td>my main point, he has since told me that further reflection </td></tr>
<tr><td>and new facts have made him a convert. </td></tr>
<tr><td>In the older, or perhaps newer, Pliocene age (a little </td></tr>
<tr><td>before the Glacial epoch) the temperature was higher ; of </td></tr>
<tr><td>this there can be little doubt ; the land, on a large scale, </td></tr>
<tr><td>held much its present disposition ; the species were mainly, </td></tr>
<tr><td>judging from shells, what they are now. At this period </td></tr>
<tr><td>when all animals and plants ranged 10�� or 15�� nearer the </td></tr>
<tr><td>poles, I believe the northern part of Siberia and of North </td></tr>
<tr><td>America, being almost continuous, were peopled (it is quite </td></tr>
<tr><td>possible, considering the shallow water, that Behring Straits </td></tr>
<tr><td>were united, perhaps a little southward) by a nearly uniform </td></tr>
<tr><td>fauna and flora, just as the Arctic regions now are. The </td></tr>
<tr><td>climate then became gradually colder till it became what </td></tr>
<tr><td>it now is ; and then the temperate parts of Europe and </td></tr>
<tr><td>America would be separated, as far as migration is concerned, </td></tr>
<tr><td>just as they now are. Then came on the Glacial period, </td></tr>
<tr><td>driving far south all living things ; middle or even southern </td></tr>
<tr><td>(5) The Comolete Work of Charles Darwin Online </td></tr>
<tr><td>136 THE WRITING OF THE 'ORIGIN OF SPECIES.��� [1858. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Europe being peopled with Arctic productions ; as the warmth </td></tr>
<tr><td>returned, the Arctic productions slowly crawled up the moun- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tains as they became denuded of snow ; and we now see on </td></tr>
<tr><td>their summits the remnants of a once continuous flora and </td></tr>
<tr><td>fauna. This is E. Forbes���s theory, which, however, I may </td></tr>
<tr><td>add, I had written out four years before he published. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Some facts have made me vaguely suspect that between </td></tr>
<tr><td>the glacial and the present temperature there was a period </td></tr>
<tr><td>of slightly greater warmth. According to my modification- </td></tr>
<tr><td>doctrines, I look at many of the species of North America </td></tr>
<tr><td>which closely represent those of Europe, as having become </td></tr>
<tr><td>modified since the Pliocene period, when in the northern part </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the world there was nearly free communication between </td></tr>
<tr><td>the old and new worlds. But now comes a more important </td></tr>
<tr><td>consideration ; there is a considerable body of geological </td></tr>
<tr><td>evidence that during the Glacial epoch the whole world was </td></tr>
<tr><td>colder ; I inferred that, many years ago, from erratic boulder </td></tr>
<tr><td>phenomena carefully observed by me on both the east and </td></tr>
<tr><td>west coast of South America. Now I am so bold as to </td></tr>
<tr><td>believe that at the height of the Glacial epoch, and when all </td></tr>
<tr><td>Tropical productions must have been considerably distressed, </td></tr>
<tr><td>several temperate forms slowly travelled into the heart of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>Tropics, and even reached the southern hemisphere ; and some </td></tr>
<tr><td>few southern forms penetrated in a reverse direction north- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ward. (Heights of Borneo with Australian forms, Abyssinia </td></tr>
<tr><td>with Cape forms.) Wherever there was nearly continuous high </td></tr>
<tr><td>land, this migration would have been immensely facilitated ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>hence the European character of the plants of Tierra del Fuego </td></tr>
<tr><td>and summits of Cordilleras ; hence ditto on Himalaya. As the </td></tr>
<tr><td>temperature rose, all the temperate intruders would crawl up </td></tr>
<tr><td>the mountains. Hence the European forms on Nilgherries, </td></tr>
<tr><td>Ceylon, summit of Java, Organ Mountains of Brazil. But </td></tr>
<tr><td>these intruders being surrounded with new forms would be </td></tr>
<tr><td>very liable to be improved or modified by natural selection, </td></tr>

<tr><td>Tropics are not identical, but representative forms of North </td></tr>

<tr><td>There are similar classes of facts in marine productions. </td></tr>

<tr><td>but I am sure not so rash as it will at first appear to you : </td></tr>

<tr><td>plexing at present till my Abstract is done. Your last very </td></tr>
<tr><td>instructive letter shall make me very cautious on the hyper- </td></tr>
<tr><td>speculative points we have been discussing. </td></tr>
<tr><td>When you say you cannot master the train of thoughts, </td></tr>
<tr><td>I know well enough that they are too doubtful and obscure to </td></tr>
<tr><td>be mastered. I have often experienced what you call the </td></tr>
<tr><td>humiliating feeling of getting more and more involved in </td></tr>
<tr><td>doubt, the more one thinks of the facts and reasoning on </td></tr>
<tr><td>doubtful points. But I always comfort myself with thinking </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the future, and in the full belief that the problems which we </td></tr>
<tr><td>are just entering on, will some day be solved ; and if we just </td></tr>
<tr><td>break the ground we shall have done some service, even if we </td></tr>
<tr><td>reap no harvest </td></tr>
<tr><td>I quite agree that we only differ in degree about the means </td></tr>
<tr><td>of dispersal, and that I think a satisfactory amount of accord- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ance. You put in a very striking manner the mutation of our </td></tr>
<tr><td>continents, and I quite agree ; I doubt only about our oceans. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I also agree (I am in a very agreeing frame of mind) with </td></tr>

<tr><td>here comes in a superlative bothering element of doubt, viz. </td></tr>

<tr><td>The only point in which I presumptuously rather demur </td></tr>
<tr><td>is about the status of the naturalised plants in Australia. 1 </td></tr>
<tr><td>think Muller speaks of their having spread largely beyond </td></tr>
<tr><td>cultivated ground ; and I can hardly believe that our Euro- </td></tr>

<tr><td>My dear Hooker, ��� Here is an odd, though very little, </td></tr>
<tr><td>fact. I think it would be hardly possible to name a bird </td></tr>
<tr><td>which apparently could have less to do with distribution than </td></tr>
<tr><td>a Petrel. Sir W. Milner, at St. Kilda, cut open some young </td></tr>
<tr><td>nestling Petrels, and he found large, curious nuts in their crops ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>I suspect picked up by parent birds from the Gulf stream. </td></tr>
<tr><td>He seems to value these nuts excessively. I have asked him </td></tr>
<tr><td>(but I doubt whether he will) to send a nut to Sir William </td></tr>
<tr><td>Hooker (I gave this address for grandeur���s sake) to see if any </td></tr>
<tr><td>of you can name it and its native country. Will you please </td></tr>
<tr><td>mention this to Sir William Hooker, and if the nut does ar- </td></tr>
<tr><td>rive, will you oblige me by returning it to ���Sir W. </td></tr>

<tr><td>with the name and country if you can, and let me hereafter </td></tr>
<tr><td>know. Forgive me asking you to take this much trouble ; for </td></tr>
<tr><td>it is a funny little fact after my own heart. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Now for another subject. I have finished my Abstract of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the chapter on Geographical Distribution, as bearing on my </td></tr>
<tr><td>subject. I should like you much to read it ; but I say this, </td></tr>
<tr><td>believing that you will not do so, if, as I believe to be the </td></tr>
<tr><td>case, you arc extra busy. On my honour, I shall not be </td></tr>
<tr><td>mortified, and I earnestly beg you not to do it, if it will </td></tr>

<tr><td>position and form of the whole embryo in the seed are </td></tr>
<tr><td>embryological, and how far are these very important ? I wish </td></tr>

<tr><td>ON THE RECEPTION OF THE ���ORIGIN OF SPECIES.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>To the present generation, that is to say, the people a few </td></tr>
<tr><td>years on the hither and thither side of thirty, the name of </td></tr>
<tr><td>Charles Darwin stands alongside of those of Isaac Newton and </td></tr>
<tr><td>Michael Faraday ; and, like them, calls up the grand ideal of </td></tr>
<tr><td>a searcher after truth and interpreter of Nature. They think </td></tr>
<tr><td>���of him who bore it as a rare combination of genius, industry, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and unswerving veracity, who earned his place among the </td></tr>
<tr><td>most famous men of the age by sheer native power, in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>teeth of a gale of popular prejudice, and uncheered by a </td></tr>
<tr><td>sign of favour or appreciation from the official fountains of </td></tr>
<tr><td>honour ; as one who, in spite of an acute sensitiveness to </td></tr>
<tr><td>praise and blame, and notwithstanding provocations which </td></tr>
<tr><td>might have excused any outbreak, kept himself clear of all </td></tr>
<tr><td>envy, hatred, and malice, nor dealt otherwise than fairly and </td></tr>
<tr><td>justly with the unfairness and injustice which was showered </td></tr>
<tr><td>upon him ; while, to the end of his days, he was ready to </td></tr>
<tr><td>listen with patience and respect to the most insignificant of </td></tr>
<tr><td>reasonable objectors. </td></tr>
<tr><td>And with respect to that theory of the origin of the forms of </td></tr>
<tr><td>life peopling our globe, with which Dan,vin���s name is bound up </td></tr>
<tr><td>as closely as that of Newton with the theory of gravitation, </td></tr>
<tr><td>nothing seems to be further from the mind of the present </td></tr>
<tr><td>generation than any attempt to smother it with ridicule or </td></tr>
<tr><td>to crush it by vehemence of denunciation. ��� The struggle for </td></tr>

<tr><td>words and every-day conceptions. The reality and the im- </td></tr>
<tr><td>portance of the natural processes on which Darwin founds </td></tr>
<tr><td>his deductions are no more doubted than those of growth </td></tr>
<tr><td>and multiplication ; and, whether the full potency attributed </td></tr>
<tr><td>to them is admitted or not, no one doubts their vast and far- </td></tr>
<tr><td>reaching significance. Wherever the biological sciences are </td></tr>
<tr><td>studied, the ��� Origin of Species ��� lights the path of the in- </td></tr>
<tr><td>vestigator ; wherever they are taught it permeates the course </td></tr>
<tr><td>of instruction. Nor has the influence of Darwinian ideas </td></tr>
<tr><td>been less profound, beyond the realms of Biology. The </td></tr>
<tr><td>oldest of all philosophies, that of Evolution, was bound hand </td></tr>
<tr><td>and foot and cast into utter darkness during the millennium </td></tr>
<tr><td>of theological scholasticism. But Darwin poured new life- </td></tr>
<tr><td>blood into the ancient frame ; the bonds burst, and the </td></tr>
<tr><td>revivified thought of ancient Greece has proved itself to be </td></tr>
<tr><td>a more adequate expression of the universal order of things </td></tr>
<tr><td>than any of the schemes which have been accepted by the </td></tr>
<tr><td>credulity and welcomed by the superstition of seventy later </td></tr>
<tr><td>generations of men. </td></tr>
<tr><td>To any one who studies the signs of the times, the </td></tr>
<tr><td>emergence of the philosophy of Evolution, in the attitude of </td></tr>
<tr><td>claimant to the throne of the world of thought, from the </td></tr>
<tr><td>limbo of hated and, as many hoped, forgotten things, is the </td></tr>
<tr><td>most portentous event of the nineteenth century. But the </td></tr>
<tr><td>most effective weapons of the modem champions of Evolution </td></tr>
<tr><td>were fabricated by Darwin ; and the ��� Origin of Species ' has </td></tr>
<tr><td>enlisted a formidable body of combatants, trained in the se- </td></tr>
<tr><td>vere school of Physical Science, whose ears might have long </td></tr>
<tr><td>remained deaf to the speculations of a priori philosophers. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I do not think that any candid or instructed person will </td></tr>
<tr><td>deny the truth of that which has just been asserted. He may </td></tr>
<tr><td>hate the very name of Evolution, and may deny its pretensions </td></tr>
<tr><td>as vehemently as a Jacobite denied those of George the Second. </td></tr>
<tr><td>But there it is ��� not only as solidly seated as the Hanoverian </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� ORIGIN OF SPECIES.��� </td></tr>

<tr><td>dynasty, but happily independent of Parliamentary sanction ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>and the dullest antagonists have come to see that they have </td></tr>
<tr><td>to deal with an adversary whose bones are to be broken by </td></tr>
<tr><td>no amount of bad words. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Even the theologians have almost ceased to pit the plain </td></tr>
<tr><td>meaning of Genesis against the no less plain meaning of </td></tr>
<tr><td>Nature. Their more candid, or more cautious, representatives </td></tr>
<tr><td>have given up dealing with Evolution as if it were a damnable </td></tr>
<tr><td>heresy, and have taken refuge in one of two courses. Either </td></tr>
<tr><td>they deny that Genesis was meant to teach scientific truth, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and thus save the veracity of the record at the expense of its </td></tr>
<tr><td>authority ; or they expend their energies in devising the cruel </td></tr>
<tr><td>ingenuities of the reconciler, and torture texts in the vain </td></tr>
<tr><td>hope of making them confess the creed of Science. But when </td></tr>
<tr><td>the peine forte et dure is over, the antique sincerity of the vener- </td></tr>
<tr><td>able sufferer always reasserts itself. Genesis is honest to the </td></tr>
<tr><td>core, and professes to be no more than it is, a repository of </td></tr>
<tr><td>venerable traditions of unknown origin, claiming no scientific </td></tr>
<tr><td>authority and possessing none. </td></tr>
<tr><td>As my pen finishes these passages, I can but be </td></tr>
<tr><td>amused to think what a terrible hubbub would have been </td></tr>
<tr><td>made (in truth was made) about any similar expressions of </td></tr>
<tr><td>opinion a quarter of a century ago. In fact, the contrast </td></tr>
<tr><td>between the present condition of public opinion upon the </td></tr>
<tr><td>Darwinian question ; between the estimation in which </td></tr>
<tr><td>Darwin���s views are now held in the scientific world ; between </td></tr>
<tr><td>the acquiescence, or at least quiescence, of the theologians of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the self-respecting order at the present day and the out- </td></tr>
<tr><td>burst of antagonism on all sides in 1858-9, when the new </td></tr>
<tr><td>theory respecting the origin of species first became known to </td></tr>
<tr><td>the older generation to which I belong, is so startling that, </td></tr>

<tr><td>veneration for our wisdom which 1 should like them to dis- </td></tr>
<tr><td>play. We have not even the excuse that, thirty years ago, </td></tr>
<tr><td>Mr. Danvin was an obscure novice, who had no claims on our </td></tr>
<tr><td>attention. On the contrary, his remarkable zoological and </td></tr>
<tr><td>geological investigations had long given him an assured posi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tion among the most eminent and original investigators of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the day ; while his charming ��� Voyage of a Naturalist ��� had </td></tr>
<tr><td>justly earned him a wide-spread reputation among the general </td></tr>
<tr><td>public. I doubt if there was any man then living who had a </td></tr>
<tr><td>better right to expect that anything he might choose to say </td></tr>
<tr><td>on such a question as the Origin of Species would be listened </td></tr>
<tr><td>to with profound attention, and discussed w'ith respect ; and </td></tr>
<tr><td>there was certainly no man whose personal character should </td></tr>

<tr><td>to Natural Science.��� And all this high and mighty talk, which </td></tr>
<tr><td>would have been indecent in one of Mr. Darwin���s equals, </td></tr>
<tr><td>proceeds from a writer whose want of intelligence, or of con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>science, or of both, is so great, that, by way of an objection to </td></tr>
<tr><td>Mr. Darwin���s views, he can ask, ��� Is it credible that all favour- </td></tr>
<tr><td>able varieties of turnips are tending to become men ; ��� who is </td></tr>
<tr><td>so ignorant of paleontology, that he can talk of the ��� flowers </td></tr>
<tr><td>and fruits ��� of the plants of the carboniferous epoch ; of com- </td></tr>
<tr><td>parative anatomy, that he can gravely affirm the poison appa- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ratus of the venomous snakes to be ��� entirely separate from </td></tr>
<tr><td>the ordinary laws of animal life, and peculiar to themselves </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the rudiments of physiology, that he can ask, ��� what </td></tr>
<tr><td>advantage of life could alter the shape of the corpuscles into </td></tr>
<tr><td>which the blood can be evaporated ? ��� Nor does the reviewer </td></tr>
<tr><td>fail to flavour this outpouring of preposterous incapacity with </td></tr>
<tr><td>a little stimulation of the odium tlmlogicum. Some inkling </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the history of the conflicts between Astronomy, Geology, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and Theology, leads him to keep a retreat open by the </td></tr>
<tr><td>proviso that he cannot ���consent to test the truth of Natural </td></tr>
<tr><td>Science by the word of Revelation ; ��� but, for all that, he </td></tr>
<tr><td>devotes pages to the exposition of his conviction that Mr. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Darwin���s theory ���contradicts the revealed relation of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>creation to its Creator,��� and is ��� inconsistent with the fulness </td></tr>
<tr><td>of his glory.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>If I confine my retrospect of the reception of the ��� Origin </td></tr>
<tr><td>of Species ��� to a twelvemonth, or thereabouts, from the time </td></tr>
<tr><td>�� The Comolete Work of Charles Darwin Online </td></tr>
<tr><td>of its publication, I do not recollect anything quite so foolish </td></tr>
<tr><td>and unmannerly as the ���Quarterly Review��� article, unless, </td></tr>
<tr><td>perhaps, the address of a Reverend Professor to the Dublin </td></tr>
<tr><td>Geological Society might enter into competition with it But </td></tr>
<tr><td>a large proportion of Mr. Darwin���s critics had a lamentable </td></tr>
<tr><td>resemblance to the ���Quarterly��� reviewer, in so far as they </td></tr>
<tr><td>lacked either the will, or the wit, to make themselves masters </td></tr>
<tr><td>of his doctrine ; hardly any possessed the knowledge required </td></tr>
<tr><td>to follow him through the immense range of biological and </td></tr>
<tr><td>geological science which the ��� Origin ��� covered ; while, too </td></tr>
<tr><td>commonly, they had prejudged the case on theological </td></tr>
<tr><td>grounds, and, as seems to be inevitable when this happens, </td></tr>
<tr><td>eked out lack of reason by superfluity of railing. </td></tr>
<tr><td>But it will be more pleasant and more profitable to consider </td></tr>
<tr><td>those criticisms, which were acknowledged by writers of </td></tr>
<tr><td>scientific authority, or which bore internal evidence of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>greater or less competency and, often, of the good faith, of </td></tr>
<tr><td>their authors. Restricting my survey to a twelvemonth, or </td></tr>
<tr><td>thereabouts, after the publication of the ��� Origin,��� I find </td></tr>
<tr><td>among such critics Louis Agassiz;* Murray, an excellent </td></tr>
<tr><td>entomologist ; Harvey, a botanist of considerable repute ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>and the author of an article in the * Edinburgh Review,��� all </td></tr>
<tr><td>strongly adverse to Darwin. Pictet, the distinguished and </td></tr>

<tr><td>the range of academical influences, M. Laugel, gave an excel- </td></tr>
<tr><td>lent and appreciative notice of the ���Origin��� in the ���Revue </td></tr>

<tr><td>in the course of a few years, the strength (and perhaps I may add </td></tr>
<tr><td>the weakness) of ��� Darwinismus ��� would have its most exten- </td></tr>
<tr><td>sive and most brilliant illustrations in the land of learning. </td></tr>
<tr><td>If a foreigner may presume to speculate on the cause of this </td></tr>

<tr><td>run the risk of appearing egotistical. However, if I tell my </td></tr>
<tr><td>own story it is only because I know it better than that of </td></tr>
<tr><td>other people. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I think I must have read the ��� Vestiges ��� before I left Eng- </td></tr>
<tr><td>land in 1846 ; but, if I did, the book made very little impres- </td></tr>
<tr><td>sion upon me, and I was not brought into serious contact with </td></tr>
<tr><td>the ���Species��� question until after 1850. At that time, I had </td></tr>
<tr><td>long done with the Pentateuchal cosmogony, which had been </td></tr>
<tr><td>impressed upon my childish understanding as Divine truth, </td></tr>
<tr><td>with all the authority of parents and instructors, and from </td></tr>
<tr><td>which it had cost me many a struggle to get free. But my </td></tr>
<tr><td>mind was unbiassed in respect of any doctrine which presented </td></tr>
<tr><td>itself, if it professed to be based on purely philosophical and </td></tr>
<tr><td>scientific reasoning. It seemed to me then (as it does now) </td></tr>
<tr><td>that ��� creation,��� in the ordinary sense of the word, is perfectly </td></tr>
<tr><td>conceivable. I find no difficulty in imagining that, at some </td></tr>
<tr><td>former period, this universe was not in existence ; and that </td></tr>
<tr><td>it made its appearance in six days (or instantaneously, if </td></tr>
<tr><td>that is preferred), in consequence of the volition of some pre- </td></tr>
<tr><td>existent Being. Then, as now, the so-called a priori argu- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ments against Theism, and, given a Deity, against the </td></tr>
<tr><td>possibility of creative acts, appeared to me to be devoid of </td></tr>
<tr><td>reasonable foundation. I had not then, and I have not now, </td></tr>
<tr><td>the smallest a priori objection to raise to the account of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>creation of animals and plants given in ��� Paradise Lost,��� in </td></tr>
<tr><td>which Milton so vividly embodies the natural sense of Genesis. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Far be it from me to say that it is untrue because it is impos- </td></tr>

<tr><td>sible. I confine myself to what must be regarded as a modest </td></tr>
<tr><td>and reasonable request for some particle of evidence that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>existing species of animals and plants did originate in that </td></tr>
<tr><td>way, as a condition of my belief in a statement which appears </td></tr>
<tr><td>to me to be highly improbable. </td></tr>
<tr><td>And, by way of being perfectly fair, I had exactly the </td></tr>
<tr><td>same answer to give to the evolutionists of 1851-8. Within </td></tr>
<tr><td>the ranks of the biologists, at that time, I met with nobody, </td></tr>
<tr><td>except Dr. Grant, of University College, who had a word to say </td></tr>
<tr><td>for Evolution ��� and his advocacy was not calculated to advance </td></tr>
<tr><td>the cause. Outside these ranks, the only person known to me </td></tr>
<tr><td>whose knowledge and capacity compelled respect, and who </td></tr>
<tr><td>was, at the same time, a thorough-going evolutionist, was Mr. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Herbert Spencer, whose acquaintance I made, I think, in </td></tr>
<tr><td>1852, and then entered into the bonds of a friendship which, </td></tr>
<tr><td>I am happy to think, has known no interruption. Many and </td></tr>
<tr><td>prolonged were the battles we fought on this topic. But </td></tr>
<tr><td>even my friend���s rare dialectic skill and copiousness of </td></tr>
<tr><td>apt illustration could not drive me from my agnostic position. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I took my stand upon two grounds : firstly, that up to that </td></tr>
<tr><td>time, the evidence in favour of transmutation was wholly </td></tr>
<tr><td>insufficient; and, secondly, that no suggestion respecting </td></tr>
<tr><td>the causes of the transmutation assumed, which had been </td></tr>
<tr><td>made, was in any way adequate to explain the phenomena. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Looking back at the state of knowledge at that time, I </td></tr>
<tr><td>really do not see that any other conclusion was justifiable. </td></tr>
<tr><td>In those days I had never even heard of Treviranus��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� Biologic.��� However, I had studied Lamarck attentively and </td></tr>
<tr><td>I had read the ��� Vestiges ��� with due care ; but neither of them </td></tr>
<tr><td>afforded me any good ground for changing my negative </td></tr>
<tr><td>and critical attitude. As for the ��� Vestiges,��� I confess that </td></tr>
<tr><td>the book simply irritated me by the prodigious ignorance </td></tr>
<tr><td>and thoroughly unscientific habit of mind manifested by the </td></tr>
<tr><td>writer. If it had any influence on me at all, it set me </td></tr>
<tr><td>against Evolution ; and the only review I ever have qualms </td></tr>

<tr><td>THE ���ORIGIN OF SPECIES.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>of conscience about, on the ground of needless savagery, is </td></tr>
<tr><td>one I wrote on the ��� Vestiges ��� while under that influence. </td></tr>

<tr><td>reproach to Lamarck to say that the discussion of the Species </td></tr>
<tr><td>question in that work, whatever might be said for it in 1809, </td></tr>
<tr><td>was miserably below the level of the knowledge of half a </td></tr>
<tr><td>century later. In that interval of time the elucidation of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the structure of the lower animals and plants had given rise </td></tr>
<tr><td>to wholly new conceptions of their relations ; histology and </td></tr>
<tr><td>embryology, in the modern sense, had been created ; physio- </td></tr>
<tr><td>logy had been reconstituted ; the facts of distribution, </td></tr>
<tr><td>geological and geographical, had been prodigiously multi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>plied and reduced to order. To any biologist whose studies </td></tr>
<tr><td>had carried him beyond mere species-mongering in 1850, one- </td></tr>
<tr><td>half of Lamarck���s arguments were obsolete and the other </td></tr>
<tr><td>half erroneous, or defective, in virtue of omitting to deal with </td></tr>
<tr><td>the various classes of evidence which had been brought to </td></tr>
<tr><td>light since his time. Moreover his one suggestion as to the </td></tr>
<tr><td>cause of the gradual modifleation of species ��� effort excited </td></tr>
<tr><td>by change of conditions ��� was, on the face of it, inapplicable to </td></tr>
<tr><td>the whole vegetable world. I do not think that any impartial </td></tr>

<tr><td>and notorious of natural facts, until they were, so to speak, </td></tr>

<tr><td>most remarkable service to the philosophy of Biology ren- </td></tr>
<tr><td>dered by Mr. Darwin is the reconciliation of Teleology and </td></tr>
<tr><td>Morphology, and the explanation of the facts of both, which </td></tr>

<tr><td>such as we see it in man, or one of the higher vertebrata, was </td></tr>
<tr><td>made with the precise structure it exhibits, for the purpose of </td></tr>
<tr><td>enabling the animal which possesses it to see, has undoubtedly </td></tr>

<tr><td>member that there is a wider teleology which is not touched </td></tr>
<tr><td>by the doctrine of Evolution, but is actually based upon the </td></tr>

<tr><td>rather hotter, and rather less hot, to rather damper and dryer </td></tr>
<tr><td>climates ; and when the several species of a group are beaten </td></tr>
<tr><td>and exterminated by the several species of another group, it </td></tr>
<tr><td>will not, I think, generally be from each new species being </td></tr>

<tr><td>My dear Huxley, ��� Yesterday evening, when I read the </td></tr>
<tr><td>Times of a previous day, I was amazed to find a splendid </td></tr>
<tr><td>essay and review of me. Who can the author be? I am </td></tr>
<tr><td>intensely curious. It included an eulogium of me which quite </td></tr>
<tr><td>touched me, though I am not vain enough to think it all </td></tr>
<tr><td>deserved. The author is a literary man, and German scholar. </td></tr>
<tr><td>He has read my book very attentively ; but, what is very </td></tr>
<tr><td>remarkable, it seems that he is a profound naturalist. He </td></tr>
<tr><td>knows my Barnacle-book, and appreciates it too highly. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Lastly, he writes and thinks with quite uncommon force and </td></tr>
<tr><td>clearness ; and what is even still rarer, his writing is seasoned </td></tr>
<tr><td>with most pleasant wit We all laughed heartily over some </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the sentences. I was charmed with those unreasonable </td></tr>
<tr><td>mortals, who know anything, all thinking fit to range them- </td></tr>
<tr><td>selves on one side.* Who can it be? Certainly I should </td></tr>
<tr><td>have said that there was only one man in England who could </td></tr>
<tr><td>have written this essay, and that you were the man. But I </td></tr>
<tr><td>suppose I am wrong, and that there is some hidden genius of </td></tr>
<tr><td>great calibre. For how could you influence Jupiter Olympius </td></tr>
<tr><td>and make him give three and a half columns to pure science ? </td></tr>
<tr><td>The old fogies will think the world will come to an end. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Well, whoever the man is, he has done great service to the </td></tr>
<tr><td>cause, far more than by a dozen reviews in common peri- </td></tr>
<tr><td>odicals. The grand way he soars above common religious </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� The reviewer proposes to pass </td></tr>
<tr><td>by the orthodox view, according to </td></tr>
<tr><td>which the phenomena of the organic </td></tr>
<tr><td>world are ��� the immediate product </td></tr>
<tr><td>of a creative fiat, and consequently </td></tr>
<tr><td>are out of the domain of science </td></tr>
<tr><td>altogether." And he does so ��� with </td></tr>
<tr><td>less hesitation, as it so happens </td></tr>
<tr><td>that those persons who arc prac- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tically conversant with the facts of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the case (plainly a considerable </td></tr>
<tr><td>advantage) have always thought </td></tr>

<tr><td>[It is impossible to give in a short space an adequate idea </td></tr>
<tr><td>of Mr. Huxley���s article in the Times of December 26. It is </td></tr>
<tr><td>admirably planned, so as to claim for the ��� Origin ��� a respectful </td></tr>
<tr><td>hearing, and it abstains from anything like dogmatism in </td></tr>
<tr><td>asserting the truth of the doctrines therein upheld. A few pas- </td></tr>
<tr><td>sages may be quoted : ��� ��� That this most ingenious hypothesis </td></tr>
<tr><td>enables us to give a reason for many apparent anomalies in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>distribution of living beings in time and space, and that it is not </td></tr>
<tr><td>contradicted by the main phenomena of life and organisation, </td></tr>
<tr><td>appear to us to be unquestionable.��� Mr. Huxley goes on to </td></tr>
<tr><td>recommend to the readers of the ��� Origin ��� a condition of </td></tr>
<tr><td>"thdtige Skepsis " ��� a state of ���doubt which so loves truth </td></tr>
<tr><td>that it neither dares rest in doubting, nor extinguish itself </td></tr>
<tr><td>by unjustified belief.��� The final paragraph is in a strong </td></tr>
<tr><td>contrast to Professor Sedgwick and his ��� ropes of bubbles ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>(see p. 298). Mr. Huxley writes : ��� Mr. Darwin abhors mere </td></tr>
<tr><td>speculation as nature abhors a vacuum. He is as greedy of </td></tr>
<tr><td>cases and precedents as any constitutional lawyer, and all the </td></tr>
<tr><td>principles he lays down are capable of being brought to the </td></tr>
<tr><td>test of observation and experiment. The path he bids us </td></tr>
<tr><td>follow professes to be not a mere airy track, fabricated of </td></tr>
<tr><td>ideal cobwebs, but a solid and broad bridge of facts. If it be </td></tr>
<tr><td>so, it will carry us safely over many a chasm in our know- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ledge, and lead us to a region free from the snares of those </td></tr>
<tr><td>fascinating but barren virgins, the Final Causes, against whom </td></tr>

<tr><td>quote from a letter an account of the happy chance that threw </td></tr>
<tr><td>into his hands the opportunity of writing it. </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� The ��� Origin ��� was sent to Mr. Lucas, one of the staff of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the Times writers at that day, in what I suppose was the </td></tr>
<tr><td>ordinary course of business. Mr. Lucas, though an excellent </td></tr>
<tr><td>journalist, and, at a later period, editor of ��� Once a Week,��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>was as innocent of any knowledge of science as a babe, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>bewailed himself to an acquaintance on having to deal with </td></tr>
<tr><td>such a book. Whereupon he was recommended to ask me to </td></tr>
<tr><td>get him out of his difficulty, and he applied to me accordingly, </td></tr>
<tr><td>explaining, however, that it would be necessary for him </td></tr>
<tr><td>formally to adopt anything 'I might be disposed to write, by </td></tr>
<tr><td>prefacing it with two or three paragraphs of his own. </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� I was too anxious to seize upon the opportunity thus </td></tr>
<tr><td>offered of giving the book a fair chance with the multitudinous </td></tr>
<tr><td>readers of the Times to make any difficulty about condi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tions ; and being then very full of the subject, I wrote the </td></tr>
<tr><td>article faster, I think, than I ever wrote anything in my life, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and sent it to Mr. Lucas, who duly prefixed his opening </td></tr>
<tr><td>sentences. </td></tr>
<tr><td>" When the article appeared, there was much speculation as </td></tr>
<tr><td>to its authorship. The secret leaked out in time, as all secrets </td></tr>
<tr><td>will, but not by my aid ; and then I used to derive a good </td></tr>

<tr><td>essay is to the famous one of Brown (here will be sneer 1st </td></tr>

<tr><td>clear, that it would be no use at all to be a botanist (sneer </td></tr>

<tr><td>Your contrast of the south-west and south-east corners is </td></tr>
<tr><td>one of the most wonderful cases I ever heard of. . . . You </td></tr>

<tr><td>down or destroying an original Flora, which was richer in </td></tr>
<tr><td>number of species, strikes me as eminently new and important. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I am not sure whether to me the discussion on the New Zea- </td></tr>
<tr><td>land Flora is not even more instructive. I cannot too much </td></tr>

<tr><td>With respect to atolls, I think mammals would hardly </td></tr>
<tr><td>survive very long, even if the main islands (for as I have </td></tr>
<tr><td>said in the Coral Book, the outline of groups of atolls </td></tr>
<tr><td>do not look like a former continent) had been tenanted by </td></tr>
<tr><td>mammals, from the extremely small area, the very peculiar </td></tr>
<tr><td>conditions, and the probability that during subsidence all or </td></tr>
<tr><td>nearly all atolls have been breached and flooded by the sea </td></tr>
<tr><td>many times during their existence as atolls. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I cannot conceive any existing reptile being converted into </td></tr>
<tr><td>a mammal. From homologies I should look at it as certain </td></tr>
<tr><td>that all mammals had descended from some single pro- </td></tr>
<tr><td>genitor. What its nature was, it is impossible to speculate. </td></tr>
<tr><td>More like, probably, the Omithorhynchus or Echidna than any </td></tr>
<tr><td>known form ; as these animals combine reptilian characters </td></tr>
<tr><td>(and in a lesser degree bird character) with mammalian. We </td></tr>
<tr><td>must imagine some form as intermediate, as is Lepidosiren </td></tr>
<tr><td>now, between reptiles and fish, between mammals and </td></tr>
<tr><td>birds on the one hand (for they retain longer the same em- </td></tr>
<tr><td>bryological character) and reptiles on the other hand. With </td></tr>
<tr><td>respect to a mammal not being developed on any island, </td></tr>
<tr><td>besides want of time for so prodigious a development, there </td></tr>
<tr><td>must have arrived on the island the necessary and peculiar </td></tr>
<tr><td>progenitor, having a character like the embryo of a mammal ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>and not an already developed reptile, bird or fish. </td></tr>

<tr><td>inheritance would retain almost for eternity some of the bird- </td></tr>
<tr><td>like structure, and prevent a new creature ranking as a true </td></tr>
<tr><td>mammal. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I have often speculated on antiquity of islands, but not </td></tr>
<tr><td>with your precision, or at all under the point of view of </td></tr>
<tr><td>Natural Selection not having done what might have been </td></tr>
<tr><td>anticipated. The argument of littoral Miocene shells at the </td></tr>

<tr><td>With respect to bats at New Zealand (N.B. There are two or </td></tr>
<tr><td>three European bats in Madeira, and I think in the Canary </td></tr>
<tr><td>Islands) not having given rise to a group of non-volant bats, </td></tr>
<tr><td>it is, now you put the case, surprising ; more especially as </td></tr>
<tr><td>the genus of bats in New Zealand is very peculiar, and there- </td></tr>
<tr><td>fore has probably been long introduced, and they now speak </td></tr>
<tr><td>of Cretacean fossils there. But the first necessary step has to </td></tr>
<tr><td>be shown, namely, of a bat taking to feed on the ground, or </td></tr>
<tr><td>anyhow, and anywhere, except in the air. I am bound to </td></tr>
<tr><td>confess I do know one single such fact, viz. of an Indian species </td></tr>
<tr><td>killing frogs. Observe, that in my wretched Polar Bear case, </td></tr>
<tr><td>I do show the first step by which conversion into a whale </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� would be easy,��� ��� would offer no difficulty ��� I ! So with seals, </td></tr>
<tr><td>I know of no fact showing any the least incipient variation of </td></tr>
<tr><td>seals feeding on the shore. Moreover, seals wander much ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>I searched in vain, and could not find otie case of any species </td></tr>
<tr><td>of seal confined to any islands. And hence wanderers would </td></tr>
<tr><td>be apt to cross with individuals undergoing any change on an </td></tr>
<tr><td>island, as in the case of land birds of Madeira and Bermuda. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The same remark applies even to bats, as they frequently </td></tr>
<tr><td>come to Bermuda from the mainland, though about 600 miles </td></tr>
<tr><td>distant. With respect to the Amblyrhynchus of the Gala- </td></tr>
<tr><td>pagos, one may infer as probable, from marine habits being </td></tr>
<tr><td>so rare with Saurians, and from the terrestrial species being </td></tr>
<tr><td>confined to a few central islets, that its progenitor first arrived </td></tr>
<tr><td>at the Galapagos ; from what country it is impossible to say, </td></tr>
<tr><td>as its affinity I believe is not very clear to any known species. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The offspring of the terrestrial species was probably rendered </td></tr>
<tr><td>marine. Now in this case I do not pretend I can show </td></tr>

<tr><td>Never think of this, for I look at every letter of yours as an </td></tr>

<tr><td>their habits (as the number of bones of the head, &c., covering </td></tr>
<tr><td>of hair, identical embryological development, &c. &c.). Now </td></tr>
<tr><td>this large amount of similarity I must look at as certainly </td></tr>
<tr><td>due to inheritance from a common stock. I am aware that </td></tr>
<tr><td>some cases occur in which a similar or nearly similar organ </td></tr>
<tr><td>has been acquired by independent acts of natural selection. </td></tr>

<tr><td>[The beginning of the year 1861 saw my father with the </td></tr>
<tr><td>third chapter of ���The Variation of Animals and Plants��� still </td></tr>
<tr><td>on his hands. It had been begun in the previous August, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and was not finished until March 1861. He was, however, for </td></tr>
<tr><td>part of this time (I believe during December i860 and </td></tr>
<tr><td>January 1861) engaged in a new edition (3000 copies) of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� Origin,��� which was largely corrected and added to, and was </td></tr>
<tr><td>published in April 1861. </td></tr>
<tr><td>With regard to this, the third edition, he wrote to Mr. Murray </td></tr>
<tr><td>in December i860: ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� I shall be glad to hear when you have decided how many </td></tr>
<tr><td>copies you will print off��� the more the better for me in all </td></tr>

<tr><td>have made in hopes of making my many rather stupid </td></tr>
<tr><td>reviewers at least understand what is meant I hope and </td></tr>
<tr><td>think I shall improve the book considerably.��� </td></tr>

<tr><td>took the work of translation. The book was now spreading </td></tr>
<tr><td>on the Continent, a Dutch edition had appeared, and, as we </td></tr>
<tr><td>have seen, a German translation had been published in i860. </td></tr>
<tr><td>In a letter to Mr. Murray (September 10, 1861), he wrote, </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� My book seems exciting much attention in Germany, </td></tr>
<tr><td>judging from the number of discussions sent me.��� The </td></tr>
<tr><td>silence had been broken, and in a few years the voice of </td></tr>
<tr><td>German science was to become one of the strongest of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>advocates of evolution. </td></tr>
<tr><td>During all the early part of the year (1861) he was working </td></tr>
<tr><td>at the mass of details which are marshalled in order in the early </td></tr>

<tr><td>from what was then the main body of the town, and not far </td></tr>
<tr><td>from the beautiful cliffed coast-line in the neighbourhood of </td></tr>
<tr><td>Anstey���s Cove. </td></tr>
<tr><td>During the Torquay holiday, and for the remainder of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>year, he worked at the fertilisation of orchids. This part of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the year 1861 is not dealt with in the present chapter, because </td></tr>

<tr><td>cious mess of it. You have most clearly stated and solved </td></tr>
<tr><td>a wonderful problem. No doubt with most jjeople this will </td></tr>

<tr><td>facts and reasonings on variation, and on the segregation of </td></tr>
<tr><td>complete and semi-complete species, is not really more, or </td></tr>
<tr><td>at least as valuable, a part. I never conceived the process </td></tr>
<tr><td>nearly so clearly before ; one feels present at the creation of </td></tr>
<tr><td>new forms. I wish, however, you had enlarged a little more </td></tr>
<tr><td>on the pairing of similar varieties; a rather more numerous </td></tr>

<tr><td>of curious miscellaneous observations there arc ��� as on related </td></tr>
<tr><td>varieties of one species ; other mi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>mickers are undoubtedly distinct </td></tr>

<tr><td>So again, some of the mimicked </td></tr>
<tr><td>forms can be shown to be merely </td></tr>
<tr><td>varieties ; but the greater number </td></tr>
<tr><td>must be ranked as distinct species. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Hence the creationist will have to </td></tr>
<tr><td>admit that some of these forms </td></tr>
<tr><td>have become imitators, by means </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the laws of variation, whilst </td></tr>
<tr><td>others he must look at as separately </td></tr>
<tr><td>created under their present guise ; </td></tr>

<tr><td>tion of forms not themselves created </td></tr>
<tr><td>as we now see them, but due to the </td></tr>
<tr><td>laws of variation! Prof. Agassiz, </td></tr>

<tr><td>comparing language and changes of species, seems most </td></tr>
<tr><td>ingenious and interesting. He has shown great skill in </td></tr>
<tr><td>picking out salient points in the argument for change of </td></tr>
<tr><td>species ; but I am deeply disappointed (I do not mean </td></tr>
<tr><td>personally) to find that his timidity prevents him giving </td></tr>
<tr><td>any judgment . . . From all my communications with him </td></tr>
<tr><td>I must ever think that he has really entirely lost faith in </td></tr>
<tr><td>the immutability of species ; and yet one of his strongest </td></tr>
<tr><td>sentences is nearly as follows : ��� If it should ever f be </td></tr>

<tr><td>huffed for a little time with me. I know some men would </td></tr>
<tr><td>have been so. I have hardly any more criticisms, anyhow, </td></tr>

<tr><td>a great objection to this term that it cannot be used as a </td></tr>

<tr><td>I infer from H. Spencer continually using the words, natural </td></tr>
<tr><td>selection. I formerly thought, probably in an exaggerated </td></tr>
<tr><td>degree, that it was a great advantage to bring into connection </td></tr>
<tr><td>natural and artificial selection ; this indeed led me to use a </td></tr>

<tr><td>of course send you a copy. I will use the term in my next </td></tr>
<tr><td>book on Domestic Animals, &c., from which, by the way, I </td></tr>

<tr><td>Natural Selection has now been so largely used abroad and </td></tr>
<tr><td>at home, that I doubt whether it could be given up, and with </td></tr>
<tr><td>all its faults I should be sorry to see the attempt made. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Whether it will be rejected must now depend ��� on the survival </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the fittest.��� As in time the term must grow intelligible </td></tr>
<tr><td>the objections to its use will grow weaker and weaker. I </td></tr>

<tr><td>subject intelligible to some minds, clear as it is to others; </td></tr>
<tr><td>for do we not see even to the present day Malthus on Popu- </td></tr>

<tr><td>had better go back to Southampton ; the inhabitants having </td></tr>

<tr><td>This tallies with my father���s habits, as described by him- </td></tr>
<tr><td>self. When a difficulty or an objection occurred to him, </td></tr>
<tr><td>he thought it of paramount importance to make a note of </td></tr>
<tr><td>it instantly, because he found hostile facts to be especially </td></tr>
<tr><td>evanescent. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The same point is illustrated by the following incident, for </td></tr>
<tr><td>which I am indebted to Mr. Romanes : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� I have always remembered the following little incident as </td></tr>
<tr><td>a good example of Mr. Darwin���s extreme solicitude on the </td></tr>
<tr><td>score of accuracy. One evening at Down there was a </td></tr>
<tr><td>general conversation upon the difficulty of explaining the </td></tr>
<tr><td>evolution of some of the distinctively human emotions, espe- </td></tr>
<tr><td>cially those appertaining to the recognition of beauty in </td></tr>
<tr><td>natural scenery. I suggested a view of my own upon the </td></tr>
<tr><td>subject, which, depending upon the principle of association, </td></tr>
<tr><td>required the supposition that a long line of ancestors should </td></tr>
<tr><td>have inhabited regions, the scenery of which is now re- </td></tr>
<tr><td>garded as beautiful. Just as I was about to observe that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>chief difficulty attaching to my hypothesis arose from </td></tr>
<tr><td>feelings of the sublime (seeing that these are associated with </td></tr>
<tr><td>awe, and might therefore be expected not to be agreeable), </td></tr>
<tr><td>Mr. Darwin anticipated the remark, by asking how the </td></tr>
<tr><td>hypothesis was to meet the case of these feelings. In the </td></tr>
<tr><td>conversation which followed, he said the occasion in his own </td></tr>
<tr><td>life, when he was most affected by the emotions of the sublime </td></tr>
<tr><td>was when he stood upon one of the summits of the Cordillera, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and surveyed the magnificent prospect all around. It seemed, </td></tr>
<tr><td>as he quaintly observed, as if his nerves had become fiddle- </td></tr>
<tr><td>strings, and had all taken to rapidly vibrating. This remark </td></tr>
<tr><td>was only made incidentally, and the conversation passed into </td></tr>
<tr><td>some other branch. About an hour afterwards Mr. Darwin </td></tr>
<tr><td>retired to rest, while I sat up in the smoking-room with one </td></tr>
<tr><td>of his sons. We continued smoking and talking for several </td></tr>
<tr><td>hours, when at about one o���clock in the morning the door </td></tr>

<tr><td>��� ' Since I went to bed I have been thinking over our con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>versation in the drawing-room, and it has just occurred to me </td></tr>
<tr><td>that I was wrong in telling you I felt most of the sublime </td></tr>
<tr><td>when on the top of the Cordillera ; I am quite sure that I </td></tr>
<tr><td>felt it even more when in the forests of Brazil. I thought it </td></tr>
<tr><td>best to come and tell you this at once in case I should be </td></tr>
<tr><td>putting you wrong. I am sure now that I felt most sublime </td></tr>

<tr><td>ance with the hypothesis which we had been discussing, than </td></tr>
<tr><td>the fact which he had previously stated. Now, as no one knew </td></tr>
<tr><td>better than Mr. Darwin the difference between a speculation </td></tr>
<tr><td>and a fact, I thought this little exhibition of scientific con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>scientiousness very noteworthy, where the only question </td></tr>

<tr><td>Dear Sir, ��� Will you excuse my venturing to ask you a </td></tr>
<tr><td>question, to which no one���s answer but your own would be </td></tr>
<tr><td>quite satisfactory ? </td></tr>
<tr><td>Do you consider the holding of your theory of Natural </td></tr>
<tr><td>Selection, in its fullest and most unreserved sense, to be </td></tr>
<tr><td>inconsistent ��� I do not say with any particular scheme of </td></tr>
<tr><td>theological doctrine ��� but with the following belief, namely : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>That knowledge is given to man by the direct inspiration </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the Spirit of God. </td></tr>
<tr><td>That God is a personal and Infinitely good Being. </td></tr>
<tr><td>That the effect of the action of the Spirit of God on the </td></tr>
<tr><td>brain of man is especially a moral effect. </td></tr>
<tr><td>And that each individual man has within certain limits </td></tr>
<tr><td>a power of choice as to how far he will yield to his hereditary </td></tr>
<tr><td>animal impulses, and how far he will rather follow the </td></tr>
<tr><td>guidance of the Spirit, who is educating him into a power of </td></tr>
<tr><td>resisting those impulses in obedience to moral motives ? </td></tr>
<tr><td>The reason why I ask you is this : my own impression has </td></tr>
<tr><td>always been, not only that your theory was perfectly com- </td></tr>
<tr><td>patible with the faith to which I have just tried to give </td></tr>
<tr><td>expression, but that your books afforded me a clue which </td></tr>
<tr><td>would guide me in applying that faith to the solution of </td></tr>
<tr><td>certain complicated psychological problems which it was </td></tr>
<tr><td>of practical importance to me as a mother to solve. I felt </td></tr>
<tr><td>that you had supplied one of the missing links ��� not to say </td></tr>
<tr><td>the missing link ��� between the facts of science and the pro- </td></tr>
<tr><td>mises of religion. Every year's experience tends to deepen </td></tr>
<tr><td>in me that impression. </td></tr>
<tr><td>But I have lately read remarks on the probable bearing of </td></tr>
<tr><td>your theory on religious and moral questions which have </td></tr>
<tr><td>perplexed and pained me sorely. I know that the persons </td></tr>

<tr><td>directly in a difficulty, than that she should puzzle too long </td></tr>

<tr><td>At the same time I feel that you have a perfect right to </td></tr>

<tr><td>first adherents of the new faith as more or less popular </td></tr>
<tr><td>writers, not especially likely to advance its acceptance with </td></tr>
<tr><td>the professorial or purely scientific world. And he claims for </td></tr>
<tr><td>Haeckel that it was his advocacy of Evolution in his * Radio- </td></tr>

<tr><td>Stettin in 1863, that placed the Darwinian question for the </td></tr>

<tr><td>it is certain, that the degree of sterility of the individuals A </td></tr>
<tr><td>and B will vary, but any such extra-sterile individuals of, we </td></tr>

<tr><td>My DEAR Sir, ��� I return you my sincere thanks for your </td></tr>
<tr><td>long letter, which I consider a great compliment, and which </td></tr>
<tr><td>is quite full of most interesting facts and views. Your </td></tr>

<tr><td>able, for the whole edition was sold within the first week, </td></tr>

<tr><td>should think would supply the demand for ever. You ask </td></tr>
<tr><td>me when I shall publish on the ���Variation of Species in </td></tr>

<tr><td>almost ready during several years, but I was so much </td></tr>
<tr><td>fatigued by my last book that I determined to amuse myself </td></tr>
<tr><td>by publishing a short essay on the ��� Descent of Man.��� I was </td></tr>
<tr><td>partly led to do this by having been taunted that I concealed </td></tr>
<tr><td>my views, but chiefly from the interest which I had long </td></tr>
<tr><td>taken in the subject Now this essay has branched out into </td></tr>
<tr><td>some collateral subjects, and I suppose will take me more </td></tr>
<tr><td>than a year to complete. I shall then begin on ���Species,��� </td></tr>

<tr><td>strong inheritance of the scalp-muscles has interested me </td></tr>
<tr><td>most. I presume that you would not object to my giving </td></tr>
<tr><td>this very curious case on your authority. As I believe all </td></tr>
<tr><td>anatomists look at the scalp-muscles as a remnant of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>Panniculus carnosus which is common to all the lower </td></tr>
<tr><td>quadrupeds, I should look at the unusual development and </td></tr>
<tr><td>inheritance of these muscles as probably a case of reversion. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Your observation on so many remarkable men in noble </td></tr>
<tr><td>families having been illegitimate is extremely curious ; and </td></tr>
<tr><td>should I ever meet any one capable of writing an essay on </td></tr>
<tr><td>this subject I will mention your remarks as a good sugges- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tion. Dr. Hooker has several times remarked to me that </td></tr>

<tr><td>���As I have formerly read with great interest many of your </td></tr>

<tr><td>satisfaction I hear that you are a believer in the gradual </td></tr>
<tr><td>evolution of species. I had supposed that my book on the </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� Origin of Species ��� had made very little impression in France, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and therefore it delights me to hear a different statement </td></tr>
<tr><td>from you. All the great authorities of the Institute seem </td></tr>
<tr><td>firmly resolved to believe in the immutability of species, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>this has always astonished me. . . . Almost the one exception, </td></tr>
<tr><td>as far as I know, is M. Gaudry, and I think he will be soon </td></tr>
<tr><td>one of the chief leaders in Zoological Palaeontology in </td></tr>

<tr><td>My DEAR HAECKEL, ��� I must write to you again, for two </td></tr>
<tr><td>reasons. Firstly, to thank you for your letter about your </td></tr>
<tr><td>baby, which has quite charmed both me and my wife; I </td></tr>
<tr><td>heartily congratulate you on its birth. I remember being </td></tr>
<tr><td>surprised in my own case how soon the paternal instincts </td></tr>
<tr><td>became developed, and in you they seem to be unusually </td></tr>
<tr><td>strong, ... I hope the large blue eyes and the principles of </td></tr>
<tr><td>inheritance will make your child as good a naturalist as you </td></tr>
<tr><td>are ; but, judging from my own experience, you will be </td></tr>
<tr><td>astonished to find how the whole mental disposition of your </td></tr>
<tr><td>children changes with advancing years. A young child, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>the same when nearly grown, sometimes differ almost as much </td></tr>
<tr><td>as do a caterpillar and butterfly. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The second point is to congratulate you on the projected </td></tr>
<tr><td>translation of your great work* about which I heard from </td></tr>
<tr><td>Huxley last Sunday. I am heartily glad of it, but how it has </td></tr>
<tr><td>been brought about, I know not, for a friend who supported </td></tr>
<tr><td>the proposed translation at Norwich, told me he thought </td></tr>
<tr><td>there would be no chance of it Huxley tells me that you </td></tr>
<tr><td>consent to omit and shorten some parts, and I am confident </td></tr>
<tr><td>that this is very wise. As I know your object is to instruct </td></tr>
<tr><td>the public, you will assuredly thus get many more readers </td></tr>
<tr><td>in England. Indeed, I believe that almost every book </td></tr>
<tr><td>would be improved by condensation. I have been reading a </td></tr>
<tr><td>good deal of your last book,f and the style is beautifully </td></tr>
<tr><td>clear and easy to me; but why it should differ so much </td></tr>
<tr><td>in this respect from your great work I cannot imagine. I </td></tr>
<tr><td>have not yet read the first part, but began with the </td></tr>

<tr><td>pleased me very much. I think Lyell, who was apparently </td></tr>
<tr><td>much pleased by your sending him a copy, is also much </td></tr>
<tr><td>gratified by this chapter.* Your chapters on the affinities and </td></tr>
<tr><td>genealogy of the animal kingdom strike me as admirable </td></tr>
<tr><td>and full of original thought. Your boldness, however, </td></tr>
<tr><td>sometimes makes me tremble, but as Huxley remarked, </td></tr>
<tr><td>some one must be bold enough to make a beginning in </td></tr>
<tr><td>drawing up tables of descent. Although you fully admit the </td></tr>
<tr><td>imperfection of the geological record, yet Huxley agreed with </td></tr>
<tr><td>me in thinking that you are sometimes rather rash in venturing </td></tr>
<tr><td>to say at what periods the several groups first appeared. I have </td></tr>
<tr><td>this advantage over you, that I remember how wonderfully </td></tr>
<tr><td>different any statement on this subject made 20 years ago, </td></tr>
<tr><td>would have been to what would now be the case, and I </td></tr>
<tr><td>expect the next 20 years will make quite as great a difference. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Reflect on the monocotyledonous plant just discovered in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>primordial formation in Sweden. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I repeat how glad I am at the prospect of the translation, </td></tr>
<tr><td>for I fully believe that this work and all your works will </td></tr>

<tr><td>and which I hope I have considerably improved in two or </td></tr>
<tr><td>three important points. I always thought individual differ- </td></tr>

<tr><td>blind and thought that single variations might be preserved </td></tr>
<tr><td>much oftener than I now see is possible or probable. I men- </td></tr>

<tr><td>facts of some importance. The new edition is only two pages </td></tr>
<tr><td>at the end longer than the old ; though in one part nine pages </td></tr>

<tr><td>on various points appearing to have become a little stronger </td></tr>

<tr><td>or subsequently, for protection by the accumulation of varia- </td></tr>

<tr><td>and less clean colours of ? goldfinch, the much less red on </td></tr>
<tr><td>the breast of ? bullfinch, the paler crest of golden-crested </td></tr>

<tr><td>discouraged. If the proper queries are inserted, the returns </td></tr>
<tr><td>would show whether married cousins have in their households </td></tr>
<tr><td>on the night of the census as many children as have parents </td></tr>
<tr><td>who are not related ; and should the number prove fewer, we </td></tr>
<tr><td>might safely infer either lessened fertility in the parents, or </td></tr>

<tr><td>to insert (sixth edition, p. 424), the sentence : ��� As a record </td></tr>
<tr><td>of a former state of things, I have retained in the foregoing </td></tr>
<tr><td>paragraphs and also elsewhere, several sentences which imply </td></tr>
<tr><td>that naturalists believe in the separate creation of each </td></tr>

<tr><td>l6l </td></tr>
<tr><td>through ray mind of late years. In North America, in going </td></tr>
<tr><td>from north to south or from east to west, it is clear that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>changed conditions of life have modified the organisms in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>different regions, so that they now form distinct races or even </td></tr>
<tr><td>species. It is further clear that in isolated districts, however </td></tr>
<tr><td>small, the inhabitants almost always get slightly modified, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>how far this is due to the nature of the slightly different </td></tr>
<tr><td>conditions to which they are exposed, and how far to mere </td></tr>
<tr><td>interbreeding, in the manner explained by Weismann, I can </td></tr>
<tr><td>form no opinion. The same difficulty occurred to me (as </td></tr>
<tr><td>shown in my ���Variation of Animals and Plants under Domesti- </td></tr>
<tr><td>cation ') with respect to the aboriginal breeds of cattle, sheep, </td></tr>
<tr><td>&c., in the separated districts of Great Britain, and indeed </td></tr>
<tr><td>throughout Europe. As our knowledge advances, very slight </td></tr>
<tr><td>differences, considered by systematists as of no importance </td></tr>
<tr><td>in structure, are continually found to be functionally im- </td></tr>
<tr><td>portant ; and I have been especially struck with this fact in </td></tr>
<tr><td>the case of plants to which my observations have of late years </td></tr>
<tr><td>been confined. Therefore it seems to me rather rash to </td></tr>
<tr><td>consider the slight differences between representative species, </td></tr>
<tr><td>for instance those inhabiting the different islands of the same </td></tr>
<tr><td>archipelago, as of no functional importance, and as not in any </td></tr>
<tr><td>way due to natural selection. With respect to all adopted </td></tr>
<tr><td>structures, and these are innumerable, I cannot see how M. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Wagner's view throws any light, nor indeed do I see at all </td></tr>
<tr><td>more clearly than I did before, from the numerous cases </td></tr>
<tr><td>which he has brought forward, how and why it is that a long </td></tr>
<tr><td>isolated form should almost always become slightly modified. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I do not know whether you will care about hearing my </td></tr>

<tr><td>job of reading Dr. Bastian���s book,* and have been deeply </td></tr>
<tr><td>interested by it You wished to hear my impression, but it </td></tr>
<tr><td>is not worth sending. </td></tr>
<tr><td>He seems to me an extremely able man, as, indeed, I </td></tr>
<tr><td>thought when I read his first essay. His general argument </td></tr>
<tr><td>in favour of Archebiosis f is wonderfully strong, though I </td></tr>
<tr><td>cannot think much of some few of his arguments. The result </td></tr>
<tr><td>is that I am bewildered and astonished by his statements, but </td></tr>
<tr><td>am not convinced, though, on the whole, it seems to me pro- </td></tr>
<tr><td>bable that Archebiosis is true. I am not convinced, partly </td></tr>
<tr><td>I think owing to the deductive cast of much of his reasoning ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>and I know not why, but I never feel convinced by deduction, </td></tr>
<tr><td>even in the case of H. Spencer���s writings. If Dr. Bastian���s </td></tr>
<tr><td>book had been turned upside down, and he had begun with </td></tr>
<tr><td>the various cases of Heterogenesis, and then gone on to </td></tr>
<tr><td>organic, and afterwards to saline solutions, and had then given </td></tr>
<tr><td>his general arguments, I should have been, I believe, much </td></tr>
<tr><td>more influenced. I suspect, however, that my chief difficulty </td></tr>
<tr><td>is the effect of old convictions being stereotyped on my brain. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I must have more evidence that germs, or the minutest frag- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ments of the lowest forms, are always killed by 212��� of Fahr. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Perhaps the mere reiteration of the statements given by </td></tr>
<tr><td>Dr. Bastian [of] other men, whose judgment I respect, and who </td></tr>
<tr><td>have worked long on the lower organisms, would suffice to </td></tr>
<tr><td>convince me. Here is a fine confession of intellectual weak- </td></tr>

<tr><td>ated, my mind can no more digest such statements, whether </td></tr>
<tr><td>true or false, than my stomach can digest a lump of lead. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Dr. Bastian is always comparing Archebiosis, as well as </td></tr>
<tr><td>growth, to crystallisation ; but, on this view, a Rotifer or Tardi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>grade is adapted to its humble conditions of life by a happy </td></tr>
<tr><td>accident, and this I cannot believe. . . . He must have </td></tr>
<tr><td>worked with very impure materials in some cases, as plenty </td></tr>
<tr><td>of organisms appeared in a saline solution not containing an </td></tr>
<tr><td>atom of nitrogen. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I wholly disagree with Dr. Bastian about many points in </td></tr>
<tr><td>his latter chapters. Thus the frequency of generalised forms </td></tr>
<tr><td>in the older strata seems to me clearly to indicate the common </td></tr>
<tr><td>descent with divergence of more recent forms. Notwith- </td></tr>

<tr><td>true, for it would be a discovery of transcendent importance ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>or, if false, I should like to see��� it disproved, and the facts </td></tr>
<tr><td>otherwise explained ; but I shall not live to see all this. If </td></tr>
<tr><td>ever proved, Dr. Bastian will have taken a prominent part in </td></tr>

<tr><td>me. In many parts you do me much honour, and every- </td></tr>
<tr><td>where more than justice. Authors generally like to hear what </td></tr>
<tr><td>points most strike different readers, so I will mention that of </td></tr>
<tr><td>your shorter essays, that on the future prevalence of lan- </td></tr>
<tr><td>guages, and on vaccination interested me the most, as, indeed, </td></tr>
<tr><td>did that on statistics, and free will. Great liability to certain </td></tr>
<tr><td>diseases, being probably liable to atavism, is quite a new idea </td></tr>
<tr><td>to me. At p. 322 you suggest that a young swallow ought to </td></tr>
<tr><td>be separated, and then let loose in order to test the power </td></tr>
<tr><td>of instinct ; but nature annually performs this experiment, </td></tr>
<tr><td>as old cuckoos migrate in England some weeks before the </td></tr>

<tr><td>when you back up Asa Gray in saying that all instincts are </td></tr>
<tr><td>congenital habits, I must protest. </td></tr>

<tr><td>observed (p. 322) that the butterflies on the Alps are tamer </td></tr>
<tr><td>than those on the lowlands ? Do they belong to the same </td></tr>

<tr><td>an old man, apparently about eighty years of age, told me </td></tr>
<tr><td>that he had known it ever since he was a boy. The ants </td></tr>
<tr><td>carrying the cocoons did not appear to be emigrating; </td></tr>
<tr><td>following the line, I saw many ascending a tall fir-tree still </td></tr>
<tr><td>carrying their cocoons. But when I looked closely I found </td></tr>
<tr><td>that all the cocoons were empty cases. This astonished me, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and next day I got a man to observe with me, and we again </td></tr>
<tr><td>saw ants bringing empty cocoons out of the nest ; each of us </td></tr>
<tr><td>fixed on one ant and slowly followed it, and repeated the </td></tr>
<tr><td>observation on many others. We thus found that some ants </td></tr>
<tr><td>soon dropped their empty cocoons ; others carried them for </td></tr>
<tr><td>many yards, as much as thirty paces, and others carried them </td></tr>
<tr><td>high up the fir-tree out of sight Now here I think we have </td></tr>
<tr><td>one instinct in contest with another and mistaken one. The </td></tr>
<tr><td>first instinct being to carry the empty cocoons out of the nest, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and it would have been sufficient to have laid them on the </td></tr>
<tr><td>heap of rubbish, as the first breath of wind would have blown </td></tr>
<tr><td>them away. And then came in the contest with the other </td></tr>
<tr><td>very powerful instinct of preserving and carrying their </td></tr>
<tr><td>cocoons as long as possible ; and this they could not help </td></tr>
<tr><td>doing although the cocoons were empty. According as the </td></tr>
<tr><td>one or other instinct was the stronger in each individual ant, </td></tr>
<tr><td>so did it carry the empty cocoon to a greater or less distance. </td></tr>
<tr><td>If this little observation should ever prove of any use to you, </td></tr>

<tr><td>before the Royal Commission on Vivisection.* I have, there- </td></tr>
<tr><td>fore, placed together here the matter relating to this subject, </td></tr>
<tr><td>irrespective of date. Something has already been said of my </td></tr>
<tr><td>father���s strong feeling with regard to suffering f both in man </td></tr>
<tr><td>and beast It was indeed one of the strongest feelings in his </td></tr>
<tr><td>nature, and was exemplified in matters small and great, in </td></tr>
<tr><td>his sympathy with the educational miseries of dancing dogs, </td></tr>
<tr><td>or in his horror at the sufferings of slaves. </td></tr>
<tr><td>�� The Complete Work of Charles Darwin Online </td></tr>

<tr><td>The remembrance of screams, or other sounds heard in </td></tr>
<tr><td>Brazil, when he was powerless to interfere with what he </td></tr>
<tr><td>believed to be the torture of a slave, haunted him for years, </td></tr>
<tr><td>especially at night. In smaller matters, where he could inter- </td></tr>
<tr><td>fere, he did so vigorously. He returned one day from his walk </td></tr>
<tr><td>pale and faint from having seen a horse ill-used, and from the </td></tr>
<tr><td>agitation of violently remonstrating with the man. On </td></tr>
<tr><td>another occasion he saw a horse-breaker teaching his son to </td></tr>
<tr><td>ride, the little boy was frightened and the man was rough ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>my father stopped, and jumping out of the carriage reproved </td></tr>
<tr><td>the man in no measured terms. </td></tr>
<tr><td>One other little incident may be mentioned, showing that </td></tr>
<tr><td>his humanity to animals was well known in his own neigh- </td></tr>
<tr><td>bourhood. A visitor, driving from Orpington to Down, told </td></tr>
<tr><td>the cabman to go faster. ���Why,��� said the man, ���if I had </td></tr>
<tr><td>whipped the horse this much, driving Mr. Darwin, he would </td></tr>
<tr><td>have got out of the carriage and abused me well.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>With respect to the special point under consideration, ��� the </td></tr>
<tr><td>sufferings of animals subjected to experiment, ��� nothing could </td></tr>
<tr><td>show a stronger feeling than the following extract from a </td></tr>
<tr><td>letter to Professor Ray Lankester (March 22, 1871) : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� You ask about my opinion on vivisection. I quite agree </td></tr>
<tr><td>that it is justifiable for real investigations on physiology ; but </td></tr>
<tr><td>not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a </td></tr>
<tr><td>subject which makes me sick with horror, so I will not say </td></tr>
<tr><td>another word about it, else I shall not sleep to-night" </td></tr>
<tr><td>An extract from Sir Thomas Farrer���s notes shows how </td></tr>
<tr><td>strongly he expressed himself in a similar manner in con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>versation : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� The last time I had any conversation with him was at my </td></tr>
<tr><td>house in Bryanston Square, just before one of his last seizures. </td></tr>
<tr><td>He was then deeply interested in the vivisection question ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>Some time afterwards the patient that he had undoubtedly been in- </td></tr>
<tr><td>was discharged, and wrote to thank sane when he wrote his former </td></tr>
<tr><td>my father for his interference, adding letter. </td></tr>

<tr><td>18/50 </td></tr>
<tr><td>and what he said made a deep impression on me. He was a </td></tr>
<tr><td>man eminently fond of animals and tender to them ; he would </td></tr>
<tr><td>not knowingly have inflicted pain on a living creature ; but </td></tr>
<tr><td>he entertained the strongest opinion that to prohibit experi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ments on living animals, would be to put a stop to the know- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ledge of and the remedies for pain and disease." </td></tr>
<tr><td>The Anti- Vivisection agitation, to which the following </td></tr>
<tr><td>letters refer, seems to have become specially active in 1874, as </td></tr>
<tr><td>may be seen, eg. by the index to ���Nature��� for that year, in </td></tr>
<tr><td>which the word ��� Vivisection ��� suddenly comes into promi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>nence. But before that date the subject had received the </td></tr>
<tr><td>earnest attention of biologists. Thus at the Liverpool </td></tr>
<tr><td>Meeting of the British Association in 1870, a Committee </td></tr>
<tr><td>was appointed, whose report defined the circumstances and </td></tr>
<tr><td>conditions under which, in the opinion of the signatories, </td></tr>
<tr><td>experiments on living animals were justifiable. In the spring </td></tr>
<tr><td>of 1875, Lord Hartismere introduced a Bill into the Upper </td></tr>
<tr><td>House to regulate the course of physiological research. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Shortly afterwards a Bill more just towards science in its </td></tr>
<tr><td>provisions was introduced to the House of Commons by </td></tr>
<tr><td>Messrs. Lyon Playfair, Walpole, and Ashley. It was </td></tr>
<tr><td>however, withdrawn on the appointment of a Royal Com- </td></tr>
<tr><td>mission to inquire into the whole question. The Commis- </td></tr>
<tr><td>sioners were Lords Cardwell and Winmarleigh, Mr. W. E, </td></tr>
<tr><td>Forster, Sir J. B. Karslake, Mr. Huxley, Professor Erichssen, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and Mr. R. H. Hutton : they commenced their inquiry in </td></tr>
<tr><td>July, 1875, and the Report was published early in the follow- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ing year. </td></tr>
<tr><td>In the early summer of 1876, Lord Carnarvon���s Bill, </td></tr>
<tr><td>entitled, ��� An Act to amend the Law relating to Cruelty to </td></tr>
<tr><td>Animals,��� was introduced. It cannot be denied that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>framers of this Bill, yielding to the unreasonable clamour of </td></tr>

<tr><td>January 4, 1875. </td></tr>
<tr><td>My DEAR H. ��� Your letter has led me to think over vivisec- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tion (I wish some new word like anaes-section could be </td></tr>
<tr><td>invented t) for some hours, and I will jot down my conclu- </td></tr>
<tr><td>sions, which will appear very unsatisfactory to you. I have </td></tr>
<tr><td>long thought physiology one of the greatest of sciences, sure </td></tr>
<tr><td>sooner, or more probably later, greatly to benefit mankind ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>but, judging from all other sciences, the benefits will accrue </td></tr>
<tr><td>only indirectly in the search for abstract truth. It is certain </td></tr>
<tr><td>that physiology can progress only by experiments on living </td></tr>
<tr><td>animals. Therefore the proposal to limit research to points </td></tr>
<tr><td>of which we can now see the bearings in regard to health, &c., </td></tr>
<tr><td>I look at as puerile. I thought at first it would be good to </td></tr>
<tr><td>limit vivisection to public laboratories ; but I have heard only </td></tr>
<tr><td>of those in London and Cambridge, and I think Oxford ; but </td></tr>
<tr><td>probably there may be a .few others. Therefore only men </td></tr>
<tr><td>living in a few great towns would carry on investigation, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>this I should consider a great evil. If private men were per- </td></tr>

<tr><td>do not see who is to determine whether any particular man </td></tr>
<tr><td>should receive one. It is young unknown men who are the </td></tr>

<tr><td>point Therefore I conclude, if (as is likely) some experi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ments have been tried too often, or anaesthetics have not been </td></tr>
<tr><td>used when they could have been, the cure must be in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>improvement of humanitarian feelings. Under this point of </td></tr>
<tr><td>view I have rejoiced at the present agitation. If stringent </td></tr>
<tr><td>laws are passed, and this is likely, seeing how unscientific the </td></tr>
<tr><td>House of Commons is, and that the gentlemen of England </td></tr>
<tr><td>are humane, as long as their sports are not considered, which </td></tr>
<tr><td>entail a hundred or thousand-fold more suffering than the </td></tr>
<tr><td>experiments of physiologists ��� if such laws are passed, the </td></tr>
<tr><td>result will assuredly be that physiology, which has been until </td></tr>
<tr><td>within the last few years at a standstill in England, will </td></tr>
<tr><td>languish or quite cease. It will then be carried on solely on </td></tr>
<tr><td>the Continent ; and there will be so many the fewer workers </td></tr>
<tr><td>on this grand subject, and this I should greatly regret. By </td></tr>
<tr><td>the way, F. Balfour, who has worked for two or three years </td></tr>
<tr><td>in the laboratory at Cambridge, declares to George that he </td></tr>
<tr><td>has never seen an experiment, except with animals rendered </td></tr>
<tr><td>insensible. No doubt the names of doctors will have great </td></tr>
<tr><td>weight with the House of Commons ; but very many prac- </td></tr>
<tr><td>titioners neither know nor care anything about the progress </td></tr>
<tr><td>of knowledge. I cannot at present see my way to sign any </td></tr>
<tr><td>petition, without hearing what physiologists thought would </td></tr>
<tr><td>be its effect, and then judging for myself. I certainly could </td></tr>

<tr><td>for humanity to animals, and have done what I could in my </td></tr>
<tr><td>writings to enforce this duty. Several years ago, when the </td></tr>
<tr><td>agitation against physiologists commenced in England, it </td></tr>
<tr><td>was asserted that inhumanity was here practised, and useless </td></tr>
<tr><td>suffering caused to animals ; and I was led to think that it </td></tr>
<tr><td>might be advisable to have an Act of Parliament on the </td></tr>
<tr><td>subject. I then took an active part in trying to get a Bill </td></tr>
<tr><td>passed, such as would have removed all just cause of com- </td></tr>
<tr><td>plaint, and at the same time have left physiologists free to </td></tr>
<tr><td>pursue their researches, ��� a Bill very different from the Act </td></tr>
<tr><td>which has since been passed. It is right to add that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>investigation of the matter by a Royal Commission proved </td></tr>
<tr><td>that the accusations made against our English physiologists </td></tr>
<tr><td>were false. From all that I have heard, however, I fear that </td></tr>
<tr><td>in some parts of Europe little regard is paid to the sufferings </td></tr>
<tr><td>of animals, and if this be the case, I should be glad to hear of </td></tr>
<tr><td>legislation against inhumanity in any such country. On the </td></tr>

<tr><td>that this position may safely be attributed to the differential </td></tr>
<tr><td>movement of parts of the red clay as it subsided very slowly </td></tr>
<tr><td>from the dissolution of the underlying chalk ; so that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>flints arrange themselves in the lines of least resistance. The </td></tr>
<tr><td>similar but less strongly marked arrangement of the stones in </td></tr>
<tr><td>the drift near Southampton makes me suspect that it also </td></tr>
<tr><td>must have slowly subsided ; and the notion has crossed my </td></tr>
<tr><td>mind that during the commencement and height of the glacial </td></tr>
<tr><td>period great beds of frozen snow accumulated over the south </td></tr>
<tr><td>of England, and that, during the summer, gravel and stones </td></tr>
<tr><td>were washed from the higher land over its surface, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>in superficial channels. The larger streams may have cut </td></tr>
<tr><td>right through the frozen snow, and deposited gravel in lines </td></tr>
<tr><td>at the bottom. But on each succeeding autumn, when the </td></tr>
<tr><td>running water failed, I imagine that the lines of drainage </td></tr>
<tr><td>would have been filled up by blown snow afterwards con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>gealed, and that, owing to great surface accumulations of snow, </td></tr>
<tr><td>it would be a mere chance whether the drainage, together with </td></tr>
<tr><td>gravel and sand, would follow the same lines during the next </td></tr>
<tr><td>summer. Thus, as I apprehend, alternate layers of frozen </td></tr>
<tr><td>snow and drift, in sheets and lines, would ultimately have </td></tr>
<tr><td>covered the country to a great thickness, with lines of drift </td></tr>
<tr><td>probably deposited in various directions at the bottom by </td></tr>
<tr><td>the larger streams. As the climate became warmer, the </td></tr>
<tr><td>lower beds of frozen snow would have melted with extreme </td></tr>
<tr><td>slowness, and the many irregular beds of interstratified drift </td></tr>
<tr><td>would have sunk down with equal slowness ; and during this </td></tr>
<tr><td>movement the elongated pebbles would have arranged them- </td></tr>
<tr><td>selves more or less vertically. The drift would also have been </td></tr>
<tr><td>deposited almost irrespective of the outline of the under- </td></tr>
<tr><td>lying land. When I viewed the country I could not per- </td></tr>

<tr><td>Sir J. D. Hooker (Aug. 30) : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� The death of Erasmus is a very heavy loss to all of us, for </td></tr>
<tr><td>he had a most affectionate disposition. He always appeared </td></tr>
<tr><td>to me the most pleasant and clearest headed man, whom I </td></tr>

<tr><td>to do as little as possible while resting. I feel sure that you </td></tr>

<tr><td>Of a special value, as it seems to me, is the conclusion that </td></tr>

<tr><td>Firstly, your letter on intelligence was very useful to me </td></tr>

<tr><td>Thirdly, Dr. Roux has sent me a book just published by </td></tr>
<tr><td>him: ��� Der Kampf der Theile,��� &c., 1881 (240 pages in </td></tr>
<tr><td>length). </td></tr>
<tr><td>He is manifestly a well-read physiologist and pathologist, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and from his position a good anatomist It is full of reason- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ing, and this in German is very difficult to me, so that I have </td></tr>
<tr><td>only skimmed through each page ; here and there reading </td></tr>
<tr><td>with a little more care. As far as I can imperfectly judge, it </td></tr>
<tr><td>is the most important book on Evolution which has appeared </td></tr>
<tr><td>for some time. I believe that G. H. Lewes hinted at the </td></tr>
<tr><td>same fundamental idea, viz. that there is a struggle going on </td></tr>
<tr><td>within every organism between the organic molecules, the </td></tr>
<tr><td>cells and the organs. I think that his basis is, that every cell </td></tr>
<tr><td>which best performs its function is, in consequence, at the same </td></tr>
<tr><td>time best nourished and best propagates its kind. The book </td></tr>
<tr><td>does not touch on mental phenomena, but there is much </td></tr>
<tr><td>discussion on rudimentary or atrophied parts, to which </td></tr>
<tr><td>subject you formerly attended. Now if you would like to </td></tr>
<tr><td>read this book, I would send it . . . If you read it, and are </td></tr>
<tr><td>struck with it (but I may be wholly mistaken about its value), </td></tr>
<tr><td>you would do a public service by analysing and criticising it </td></tr>
<tr><td>in ���Nature.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>Dr. Roux makes, I think, a gigantic oversight in never con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>sidering plants ; these would simplify the problem for him. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Fourthly, I do not know whether you will discuss in your </td></tr>
<tr><td>book on the mind of animals any of the more complex and </td></tr>
<tr><td>wonderful instincts. It is unsatisfactory work, as there can </td></tr>
<tr><td>be no fossilised instincts, and the sole guide is their state in </td></tr>
<tr><td>other members of the same order, and mere probability. </td></tr>
<tr><td>But if you do discuss any (and it will perhaps be expected </td></tr>
<tr><td>of you), I should think that you could not select a better case </td></tr>
<tr><td>than that of the sand wasps, which paralyse their prey, as </td></tr>
<tr><td>formerly described by Fabre, in his wonderful paper in the </td></tr>

<tr><td>1881.] </td></tr>
<tr><td>Whilst reading this latter book, I speculated a little on the </td></tr>
<tr><td>subject Astonishing nonsense is often spoken of the sand </td></tr>
<tr><td>wasp���s knowledge of anatomy. Now will any one say that </td></tr>
<tr><td>the Gauchos on the plains of La Plata have such knowledge, </td></tr>
<tr><td>yet I have often seen them pith a struggling and lassoed cow </td></tr>
<tr><td>on the ground with unerring skill, which no mere anatomist </td></tr>
<tr><td>could imitate. The pointed knife was infallibly driven in </td></tr>
<tr><td>between the vertebrae by a single slight thrust I presume </td></tr>
<tr><td>that the art was first discovered by chance, and that each </td></tr>
<tr><td>young Gaucho sees exactly how the others do it, and then </td></tr>
<tr><td>with a very little practice learns the art Now I suppose that </td></tr>
<tr><td>the sand wasps originally merely killed their prey by stinging </td></tr>
<tr><td>them in many places (see p. 129 of Fabre���s * Souvenirs,��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>and p. 241) on the lower and softest side of the body ��� and </td></tr>
<tr><td>that to sting a certain segment was found by far the most </td></tr>
<tr><td>successful method ; and was inherited like the tendency of a </td></tr>
<tr><td>bulldog to pin the nose of a bull, or of a ferret to bite the </td></tr>
<tr><td>cerebellum. It would not be a very great step in advance to </td></tr>
<tr><td>prick the ganglion of its prey only slightly, and thus to give </td></tr>
<tr><td>its larvae fresh meat instead of old dried meat Though </td></tr>
<tr><td>Fabre insists so strongly on the unvarying character of </td></tr>
<tr><td>instinct yet it is shown that there is some variability, as at </td></tr>

<tr><td>Your idea, to show what travellers have done, seems to me </td></tr>
<tr><td>a brilliant and just one, especially considering your audience. </td></tr>
<tr><td>1. I know nothing about Toumefort���s works. </td></tr>
<tr><td>2. I believe that you are fully right in calling Humboldt </td></tr>
<tr><td>the greatest scientific traveller who ever lived. I have lately </td></tr>
<tr><td>read two or three volumes again. His Geology is funny stuff ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>but that merely means that he was not in advance of his age. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I should say he was wonderful, more for his near approach to </td></tr>
<tr><td>omniscience than for originality. Whether or not his position </td></tr>
<tr><td>as a scientific man is as eminent as we think, you might truly </td></tr>
<tr><td>call him the parent of a grand progeny of scientific travellers, </td></tr>
<tr><td>who, taken together, have done much for science. </td></tr>
<tr><td>3. It seems to me quite just to give Lyell (and secondarily </td></tr>
<tr><td>E. Forbes) a very prominent place. </td></tr>
<tr><td>4 Dana was, I believe, the first man who maintained the </td></tr>
<tr><td>permanence of continents and the great oceans. . . . When I </td></tr>
<tr><td>read the 'Challenger���s' conclusion that sediment from the </td></tr>
<tr><td>land is not deposited at greater distances than 200 to 300 </td></tr>
<tr><td>miles from the land, I was much strengthened in my old </td></tr>
<tr><td>belief. Wallace seems to me to have argued the case ex- </td></tr>
<tr><td>cellently. Nevertheless, I would speak, if I were in your place, </td></tr>
<tr><td>rather cautiously ; for T. Mellard Reade has argued lately </td></tr>
<tr><td>with some force against the view ; but I cannot call to mind his </td></tr>
<tr><td>arguments. If forced to express a judgment, I should abide </td></tr>
<tr><td>by the view of approximate permanence since Cambrian days. </td></tr>
<tr><td>5. The extreme importance of the Arctic fossil plants, is </td></tr>
<tr><td>self-evident Take the opportunity of groaning over [our] </td></tr>
<tr><td>ignorance of the Lignite Plants of Kerguelen Land, or any </td></tr>
<tr><td>Antarctic land. It might do good. </td></tr>
<tr><td>6. I cannot avoid feeling sceptical about the travelling of </td></tr>
<tr><td>plants from the North except during the Tertiary period. It </td></tr>
<tr><td>may of course have been so and probably was so from one </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the two poles at the earliest period, during Pre-Cambrian </td></tr>

<tr><td>248 miscellanea ��� ( continued ). [1881. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I will now jot down without any order a few miscellaneous </td></tr>
<tr><td>remarks. </td></tr>
<tr><td>I think you ought to allude to Alph. De Candolle���s great </td></tr>
<tr><td>book, for though it (like almost everything else) is washed out </td></tr>
<tr><td>of my mind, yet I remember most distinctly thinking it a </td></tr>
<tr><td>very valuable work. Anyhow, you might allude to his </td></tr>
<tr><td>excellent account of the history of all cultivated plants. </td></tr>
<tr><td>How shall you manage to allude to your New Zealand and </td></tr>
<tr><td>Tierra del Fuego work ? if you do not allude to them you </td></tr>
<tr><td>will be scandalously unjust. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The many Angiosperm plants in the Cretacean beds of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>United States (and as far as I can judge the age of these </td></tr>
<tr><td>beds has been fairly well made out) seems to me a fact of </td></tr>
<tr><td>very great importance, so is their relation to the existing flora </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the United States under an Evolutionary point of view. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Have not some Australian extinct forms been lately found in </td></tr>
<tr><td>Australia ? or have I dreamed it ? </td></tr>
<tr><td>Again, the recent discovery of plants rather low down in </td></tr>
<tr><td>our Silurian beds is very important. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Nothing is more extraordinary in the history of the Vege- </td></tr>
<tr><td>table Kingdom, as it seems to me, than the apparently very </td></tr>
<tr><td>sudden or abrupt development of the higher plants. I have </td></tr>
<tr><td>sometimes speculated whether there did not exist somewhere </td></tr>
<tr><td>during long ages an extremely isolated continent, perhaps </td></tr>
<tr><td>near the South Pole. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Hence I was greatly interested by a view which Saporta </td></tr>
<tr><td>propounded to me, a few years ago, at great length in MS. </td></tr>
<tr><td>and which I fancy he has since published, as I urged him to </td></tr>
<tr><td>do ��� viz., that as soon as flower-frequenting insects were </td></tr>
<tr><td>developed, during the latter part of the secondary period, an </td></tr>
<tr><td>enormous impulse was given to the development of the higher </td></tr>
<tr><td>plants by cross-fertilization being thus suddenly formed. </td></tr>

<tr><td>which my father accomplished by the guidance of the light </td></tr>
<tr><td>cast on the study of natural history by his own work on </td></tr>
<tr><td>Evolution remains to be noticed. In a letter to Mr. Murray, </td></tr>
<tr><td>September 74th, 1861, speaking of his book on the ���Ferti- </td></tr>
<tr><td>lisation of Orchids,��� he says : ��� It will perhaps serve to </td></tr>
<tr><td>illustrate how Natural History may be worked under the </td></tr>
<tr><td>belief of the modification of species.��� This remark gives a </td></tr>
<tr><td>suggestion as to the value and interest of his botanical work, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and it might be expressed in far more emphatic language </td></tr>
<tr><td>without danger of exaggeration. </td></tr>
<tr><td>In the same letter to Mr. Murray, he says : ��� I think this </td></tr>
<tr><td>little volume will do good to the ' Origin,��� as it will show that </td></tr>
<tr><td>I have worked hard at details.��� It is true that his botanical </td></tr>
<tr><td>work added a mass of corroborative detail to the case for </td></tr>
<tr><td>Evolution, but the chief support to his doctrines given by </td></tr>
<tr><td>these researches was of another kind. They supplied an </td></tr>
<tr><td>argument against those critics who have so freely dogmatised </td></tr>
<tr><td>as to the uselessness of particular structures, and as to the </td></tr>
<tr><td>consequent impossibility of their having been developed by </td></tr>
<tr><td>means of natural selection. His observations on Orchids </td></tr>
<tr><td>enabled him to say : ��� I can show the meaning of some of </td></tr>
<tr><td>the apparently meaningless ridges, horns ; who will now </td></tr>
<tr><td>�� The Complete Work of Charles Darwin Online </td></tr>

<tr><td>venture to say that this or that structure is useless?" A </td></tr>
<tr><td>kindred point is expressed in a letter to Sir J. D. Hooker </td></tr>
<tr><td>(May 14th, 1862) : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>���When many parts of structure, as in the woodpecker, </td></tr>
<tr><td>show distinct adaptation to external bodies, it is preposterous </td></tr>
<tr><td>to attribute them to the effects of climate, &a, but when a </td></tr>
<tr><td>single point alone, as a hooked seed, it is conceivable it may </td></tr>
<tr><td>thus have arisen. I have found the study of Orchids emi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>nently useful in showing me how nearly all parts of the flower </td></tr>
<tr><td>are co-adapted for fertilisation by insects, and therefore the </td></tr>
<tr><td>results of natural selection, ��� even the most trifling details of </td></tr>
<tr><td>structure.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>One of the greatest services rendered by my father to the </td></tr>
<tr><td>study of Natural History is the revival of Teleology. The </td></tr>
<tr><td>evolutionist studies the purpose or meaning of organs with </td></tr>
<tr><td>the zeal of the older Teleology, but with far wider and more </td></tr>
<tr><td>coherent purpose. He has the invigorating knowledge that </td></tr>
<tr><td>he is gaining not isolated conceptions of the economy of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>present, but a coherent view of both past and present And </td></tr>
<tr><td>even where he fails to discover the use of any part, he may, </td></tr>
<tr><td>by a knowledge of its structure, unravel the history of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>past vicissitudes in the life of the species. In this way a </td></tr>
<tr><td>vigour and unity is given to the study of the forms of </td></tr>
<tr><td>organised beings, which before it lacked. This point has </td></tr>
<tr><td>already been discussed in Mr. Huxley���s chapter on the </td></tr>
<tr><td>'Reception of the Origin of Species��� and need not be </td></tr>
<tr><td>here considered. It does, however, concern us to recognize </td></tr>
<tr><td>that this ���great service to natural science,��� as Dr. Gray </td></tr>
<tr><td>describes it, was effected almost as much by his special </td></tr>
<tr><td>botanical work as by the ��� Origin of Species.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>For a statement of the scope and influence of my father���s </td></tr>

<tr><td>(p. 43) gives a true picture : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� Notwithstanding the extent and variety of his botanical </td></tr>
<tr><td>work, Mr. Darwin always disclaimed any right to be regarded </td></tr>
<tr><td>as a professed botanist. He turned his attention to plants, </td></tr>
<tr><td>doubtless because they were convenient objects for studying </td></tr>
<tr><td>organic phenomena in their least complicated forms ; and this </td></tr>
<tr><td>point of view, which, if one may use the expression without </td></tr>
<tr><td>disrespect, had something of the amateur about it, was in </td></tr>
<tr><td>itself of the greatest importance. For, from not being, till he </td></tr>
<tr><td>took up any point, familiar with the literature bearing on it, </td></tr>
<tr><td>his mind was absolutely free from any prepossession. He </td></tr>
<tr><td>was never afraid of his facts, or of framing any hypothesis, </td></tr>
<tr><td>however startling, which seemed to explain them. ... In any </td></tr>
<tr><td>one else such an attitude would have produced much work </td></tr>
<tr><td>that was crude and rash. But Mr. Darwin ��� if one may </td></tr>
<tr><td>venture on language which will strike no one who had con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>versed with him as over-strained ��� seemed by gentle persua- </td></tr>
<tr><td>sion to have penetrated that reserve of nature which baffles </td></tr>
<tr><td>smaller men. In other words, his long experience had given </td></tr>
<tr><td>him a kind of instinctive insight into the method of attack of </td></tr>
<tr><td>any biological problem, however unfamiliar to him, while he </td></tr>
<tr><td>rigidly controlled the fertility of his mind in hypothetical </td></tr>
<tr><td>explanations by the no less fertility of ingeniously devised </td></tr>

<tr><td>this branch of knowledge has emerged. It should be re- </td></tr>
<tr><td>membered that it was only during the early years of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>present century that the idea of sex, as applied to plants, </td></tr>
<tr><td>became firmly established. Sachs, in his ��� History of Botany��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>(1875), has given some striking illustrations of the remark- </td></tr>

<tr><td>by Camerarius (1694)1 and by Kolreuter (1761-66), it appears </td></tr>
<tr><td>incredible that doubts should afterwards have been raised as </td></tr>
<tr><td>to the sexuality of plants. Yet he shows that such doubts </td></tr>
<tr><td>did actually repeatedly crop up. These adverse criticisms </td></tr>
<tr><td>rested for the most part on careless experiments, but in many </td></tr>
<tr><td>cases on d priori arguments. Even as late as 1820, a book of </td></tr>
<tr><td>this kind, which would now rank with circle squaring, or flat- </td></tr>
<tr><td>earth philosophy, was seriously noticed in a botanical journal. </td></tr>
<tr><td>A distinct conception of sex as applied to plants had not </td></tr>
<tr><td>long emerged from the mists of profitless discussion and </td></tr>
<tr><td>feeble experiment, at the time when my father began botany </td></tr>
<tr><td>by attending Henslow���s lectures at Cambridge. </td></tr>
<tr><td>When the belief in the sexuality of plants had become </td></tr>
<tr><td>established as an incontrovertible piece of knowledge, a </td></tr>
<tr><td>weight of misconception remained, weighing down any </td></tr>
<tr><td>rational view of the subject Camerarius * believed (naturally </td></tr>
<tr><td>enough in his day) that hermaphrodite flowers are necessarily </td></tr>
<tr><td>self-fertilised. He had the wit to be astonished at this, a </td></tr>
<tr><td>degree of intelligence which, as Sachs points out, the majority </td></tr>
<tr><td>of his successors did not attain to. </td></tr>

<tr><td>varieties being difficult to keep [true] on account of pollen </td></tr>
<tr><td>from other plants ? Because this may be applied to show all </td></tr>
<tr><td>plants do receive intermixture.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>Sprengel,f indeed, understood that the hermaphrodite </td></tr>
<tr><td>structure of flowers by no means necessarily leads to self- </td></tr>
<tr><td>fertilisation. But although he discovered that in many cases </td></tr>
<tr><td>pollen is of necessity carried to the stigma of another flower ; </td></tr>

<tr><td>A letter to Dr. Asa Gray (Sept 5th, 1857) gives the sub- </td></tr>

<tr><td>��� Lately I was led to examine buds of kidney bean with </td></tr>

<tr><td>explicable on the doctrine of the advantage of crosses.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>The paper was supplemented by a second in 1858.* The </td></tr>
<tr><td>chief object of these publications seems to have been to </td></tr>
<tr><td>obtain information as to the possibility of growing varieties </td></tr>
<tr><td>of leguminous plants near each other, and yet keeping </td></tr>
<tr><td>them true. It is curious that the Papilionaceae should not </td></tr>
<tr><td>only have been the first flowers which attracted his attention </td></tr>
<tr><td>by their obvious adaptation to the visits of insects, but should </td></tr>
<tr><td>also have constituted one of his sorest puzzles. The common </td></tr>
<tr><td>pea and the sweet pea gave him much difficulty, because, </td></tr>
<tr><td>although they are as obviously fitted for insect-visits as the </td></tr>
<tr><td>rest of the order, yet their varieties keep true. The fact is </td></tr>
<tr><td>that neither of these plants being indigenous, they are not </td></tr>
<tr><td>perfectly adapted for fertilisation by British insects. He </td></tr>
<tr><td>could not, at this stage of his observations, know that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>co-ordination between a flower and the particular insect </td></tr>
<tr><td>which fertilises it may be as delicate as that between a lock </td></tr>
<tr><td>and its key, so that this explanation was not likely to occur </td></tr>
<tr><td>to him.f </td></tr>
<tr><td>Besides observing the Leguminosae, he had already begun, </td></tr>
<tr><td>as shown in the foregoing extracts, to attend to the structure </td></tr>

<tr><td>ledge to the relation of insects to other flowers. This is </td></tr>
<tr><td>somewhat surprising, when we remember that he had read </td></tr>

<tr><td>He was probably attracted to the study of Orchids by </td></tr>
<tr><td>the fact that several kinds are common near Down. The </td></tr>
<tr><td>letters of i860 show that these plants occupied a good deal of </td></tr>
<tr><td>his attention ; and in 1861 he gave part of the summer, and </td></tr>

<tr><td>same species. Accordingly I wrote some years ago to an </td></tr>
<tr><td>acquaintance, asking him to mark some Spider-orchids, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>observe whether they retained the same character ; but he </td></tr>
<tr><td>evidently thought the request as foolish as if I had asked him </td></tr>
<tr><td>to mark one of his cows with a ribbon, to see if it would turn </td></tr>
<tr><td>next spring into a horse. Now will you be so kind as to tie </td></tr>
<tr><td>a string round the stem of half-a-dozen Spider-orchids, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>when you leave Mentone dig them up, and I would try and </td></tr>

<tr><td>[This book, as pointed out in the ���Autobiography,��� is a </td></tr>
<tr><td>complement to the ��� Fertilisation of Orchids,��� because it shows </td></tr>
<tr><td>how important are the results of cross-fertilisation which are </td></tr>
<tr><td>ensured by the mechanisms described in that book. By </td></tr>
<tr><td>proving that the offspring of cross-fertilisation are more </td></tr>
<tr><td>vigorous than the offspring of self-fertilisation, he showed that </td></tr>
<tr><td>one circumstance which influences the fate of young plants in </td></tr>
<tr><td>the struggle for life is the degree to which their parents are </td></tr>
<tr><td>fitted for cross-fertilisation. He thus convinced himself that </td></tr>
<tr><td>the intensity of the struggle (which he had elsewhere shown </td></tr>
<tr><td>to exist among young plants) is a measure of the strength </td></tr>
<tr><td>of a selective agency perpetually sifting out every modification </td></tr>
<tr><td>in the structure of flowers which can affect its capabilities </td></tr>
<tr><td>for cross-fertilisation. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The book is also valuable in another respect, because it </td></tr>

<tr><td>spring, unless the parents have lived under slightly different </td></tr>

<tr><td>It is remarkable that this book, the result of eleven years </td></tr>

<tr><td>was astonished to observe that the offspring of self-fertilisa- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tion were clearly less vigorous than the others. It seemed </td></tr>

<tr><td>of self-fertilisation, and it was only in the following year, </td></tr>
<tr><td>when precisely the same result occurred in the case of a </td></tr>

<tr><td>���DIFFERENT FORMS OF FLOWERS ON PLANTS OF THE </td></tr>
<tr><td>SAME SPECIES.��� 1 877. </td></tr>
<tr><td>[The volume bearing the above title was published in 1877, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and was dedicated by the author to Professor Asa Gray, ��� as </td></tr>
<tr><td>a small tribute of respect and affection.��� It consists of </td></tr>
<tr><td>certain earlier papers re-edited, with the addition of a </td></tr>
<tr><td>quantity of new matter. The subjects treated in the book </td></tr>
<tr><td>(i.) Heterostyled Plants. </td></tr>
<tr><td>(ii.) Polygamous, Dicecious, and Gynodicecious Plants. </td></tr>
<tr><td>(iii.) Cleistogamic Flowers. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The nature of heterostyled plants may be illustrated in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>primrose, one of the best known examples of the class. If a </td></tr>
<tr><td>number of primroses be gathered, it will be found that some </td></tr>
<tr><td>plants yield nothing but ��� pin-eyed ��� flowers, in which the </td></tr>
<tr><td>style (or organ for the transmission of the pollen to the ovule) </td></tr>
<tr><td>is long, while the others yield only ��� thrum-eyed ��� flowers with </td></tr>
<tr><td>short styles. Thus primroses are divided into two sets or </td></tr>
<tr><td>castes differing structurally from each other. My father </td></tr>
<tr><td>showed that they also differ sexually, and that in fact the bond </td></tr>
<tr><td>between the two castes more nearly resembles that between </td></tr>
<tr><td>separate sexes than any other known relationship. Thus for </td></tr>
<tr><td>example a long-styled primrose, though it can be fertilised by </td></tr>
<tr><td>its own pollen, is not fully fertile unless it is impregnated by </td></tr>
<tr><td>the pollen of a short-styled flower. Heterostyled plants are </td></tr>
<tr><td>comparable to hermaphrodite animals, such as snails, which </td></tr>
<tr><td>require the concourse of two individuals, although each pos- </td></tr>
<tr><td>2 96 ���DIFFERENT FORMS OF FLOWERS </td></tr>
<tr><td>sesses both the sexual elements. The difference is that in </td></tr>
<tr><td>the case of the primrose it is perfect fertility, and not simply </td></tr>
<tr><td>fertility, that depends on the mutual action of the two sets of </td></tr>
<tr><td>individuals. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The work on heterostyled plants has a special bearing, to </td></tr>
<tr><td>which the author attached much importance, on the problem </td></tr>
<tr><td>of origin of species.* </td></tr>
<tr><td>He found that a wonderfully close parallelism exists </td></tr>
<tr><td>between hybridisation and certain forms of fertilisation </td></tr>
<tr><td>among heterostyled plants. So that it is hardly an exag- </td></tr>
<tr><td>geration to say that the ��� illegitimately ��� reared seedlings are </td></tr>
<tr><td>hybrids, although both their parents belong to identically the </td></tr>
<tr><td>same species. In a letter to Professor Huxley, given in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>second volume (p. 384), my father writes as if his researches </td></tr>
<tr><td>on heterostyled plants tended to make him believe that </td></tr>
<tr><td>sterility is a selected or acquired quality. But in his later </td></tr>
<tr><td>publications, eg. in the sixth edition of the ���Origin,��� he </td></tr>
<tr><td>adheres to the belief that sterility is an incidental rather than </td></tr>
<tr><td>a selected quality. The result of his work on heterostyled </td></tr>
<tr><td>plants is of importance as showing that sterility is no test </td></tr>
<tr><td>of specific distinctness, and that it depends on differentiation </td></tr>
<tr><td>of the sexual elements which is independent of any racial </td></tr>
<tr><td>difference. I imagine that it was his instinctive love of </td></tr>
<tr><td>making out a difficulty which to a great extent kept him </td></tr>
<tr><td>at work so patiently on the heterostyled plants. But it </td></tr>
<tr><td>was the fact that general conclusions of the above character </td></tr>
<tr><td>could be drawn from his results which made him think his </td></tr>

<tr><td>My dear Gray, ��� The very day after my last letter, </td></tr>

<tr><td>I feared might have been lost, reached me. We were all very </td></tr>

<tr><td>Dimorphism ; I do not at present like the term ��� Dicecio- </td></tr>
<tr><td>dimorphism ;������ for I think it gives quite a false notion, that </td></tr>
<tr><td>the phenomena are connected with a separation of the sexes. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Certainly in Primula there is unequal fertility in the two </td></tr>
<tr><td>forms, and I suspect this is the case with Linum; and, </td></tr>
<tr><td>therefore, I felt bound in the Primula paper to state that it </td></tr>
<tr><td>might be a step towards a dioecious condition; though I </td></tr>
<tr><td>believe there are no dioecious forms in Primulaceae or Linacem. </td></tr>
<tr><td>But the three forms in Lythrum convince me that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>phenomenon is in no way necessarily connected with any </td></tr>
<tr><td>tendency to separation of sexes. The case seems to me in </td></tr>
<tr><td>result or function to be almost identical with what old </td></tr>
<tr><td>C. K. Sprengel called ���dichogamy,��� and which is so frequent </td></tr>

<tr><td>could hardly doubt that the hermaphrodite state is the </td></tr>
<tr><td>aboriginal one. But how is it in the conjugation of Con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>fervae ��� is not one of the two individuals here in fact male, </td></tr>
<tr><td>and the other female? I have been much puzzled by this </td></tr>
<tr><td>contrast in sexual arrangements between plants and animals. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Can there be anything in the following consideration : By </td></tr>
<tr><td>roughest calculation about one-third of the British genera of </td></tr>
<tr><td>aquatic plants belong to the Linnean classes of Mono and </td></tr>
<tr><td>Dicecia ; whilst of terrestrial plants (the aquatic genera being </td></tr>
<tr><td>subtracted) only one-thirteenth of the genera belong to these </td></tr>
<tr><td>two classes. Is there any truth in this fact generally ? Can </td></tr>
<tr><td>aquatic plants, being confined to a small area or small com- </td></tr>
<tr><td>munity of individuals, require more free crossing, and there- </td></tr>
<tr><td>fore have separate sexes ? But to return to one point, does </td></tr>
<tr><td>not Alph. de Candolle say that aquatic plants taken as a </td></tr>
<tr><td>whole are lowly organised, compared with terrestrial ; and </td></tr>

<tr><td>ment goes on all day and all early night. It has no relation to </td></tr>

<tr><td>when I began to observe the irritability of the tendrils. I do </td></tr>

<tr><td>every one and a half or two hours sweeps a circle (according </td></tr>
<tr><td>to the length of the bending shoot and the length of the </td></tr>

<tr><td>immediately that the tendril touches any object its sensitive- </td></tr>

<tr><td>leaves into the weak solution, and after leaving them for an </td></tr>

<tr><td>no change on the four in water ; every gland and hair affected </td></tr>
<tr><td>in those in ammonia. </td></tr>
<tr><td>���I had measured the quantity of weak solution, and I </td></tr>

<tr><td>were plainly affected ; the result convinced me that each </td></tr>
<tr><td>gland could not have absorbed more than or i n inu ��f </td></tr>
<tr><td>a grain. I have tried numbers of other experiments all </td></tr>
<tr><td>pointing to the same result. Some experiments lead me to </td></tr>
<tr><td>believe that very sensitive leaves are acted on by much </td></tr>
<tr><td>smaller doses. Reflect how little ammonia a plant can get </td></tr>

<tr><td>I thought it would be safer not to consider any effect which </td></tr>
<tr><td>was not plainly visible under a two-thirds object glass and </td></tr>

<tr><td>My dear Dr. Sanderson,��� I should like to tell you a </td></tr>
<tr><td>little about my recent work with Drosera, to show that I </td></tr>
<tr><td>have profited by your suggestions, and to ask a question or </td></tr>
<tr><td>1. It is really beautiful how quickly and well Drosera and </td></tr>
<tr><td>Dionaea dissolve little cubes of albumen and gelatine. I kept </td></tr>
<tr><td>the same sized cubes on wet moss for comparison. When </td></tr>
<tr><td>you were here I forgot that I had tried gelatine, but albumen </td></tr>
<tr><td>is far better for watching its dissolution and absorption. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Frankland has told me how to test in a rough way for </td></tr>
<tr><td>pepsine ; and in the autumn he will discover what acid the </td></tr>
<tr><td>digestive juice contains. </td></tr>
<tr><td>2. A decoction of cabbage-leaves and green peas causes </td></tr>
<tr><td>as much inflection as an infusion of raw meat ; a decoction of </td></tr>
<tr><td>grass is less powerful. Though I hear that the chemists try </td></tr>
<tr><td>to precipitate all albumen from the extract of belladonna, I </td></tr>
<tr><td>think they must fail, as the extract causes inflection, whereas </td></tr>
<tr><td>a new lot of atropine, as well as the valerianate [of atropine], </td></tr>
<tr><td>produce no effect. </td></tr>
<tr><td>3. I have been trying a good many experiments with </td></tr>
<tr><td>heated water. . . . Should you not call the following case one </td></tr>
<tr><td>of heat rigor ? Two leaves were heated to 130�� and had every </td></tr>
<tr><td>tentacle closely inflected ; one was taken out and placed in </td></tr>
<tr><td>cold water, and it re-expanded ; the other was heated to 145 0 , </td></tr>
<tr><td>and had not the least power of re-expansion. Is not this </td></tr>
<tr><td>latter case heat rigor ? If you can inform me, I should very </td></tr>
<tr><td>much like to hear at what temperature cold-blooded and </td></tr>
<tr><td>invertebrate animals are killed. </td></tr>

<tr><td>4. I must tell you my final result, of which I am sure, </td></tr>
<tr><td>[as to] the sensitiveness of Drosera. I made a solution of </td></tr>
<tr><td>one part of phosphate of ammonia by weight to 218,750 </td></tr>
<tr><td>of water; of this solution I gave so much that a leaf </td></tr>
<tr><td>got -gtfoQ of a grain of the phosphate. I then counted the </td></tr>
<tr><td>glands, and each could have got only n i z h smt a g ra ' n i </td></tr>
<tr><td>this being absorbed by the glands, sufficed to cause the </td></tr>
<tr><td>tentacles bearing these glands to bend through an angle of </td></tr>
<tr><td>180��. Such sensitiveness requires hot weather, and carefully </td></tr>
<tr><td>selected young yet mature leaves. It strikes me as a </td></tr>
<tr><td>wonderful fact I must add that I took every precaution, by </td></tr>
<tr><td>trying numerous leaves at the same time in the solution and </td></tr>

<tr><td>was very stupid of me. The great solid bladder-like swellings </td></tr>

<tr><td>given of the effects of cutting off the tips of horizontally </td></tr>
<tr><td>extended roots, and of those laterally exposed to moisture ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>but I cannot persuade myself that the horizontal position of </td></tr>
<tr><td>lateral branches and roots is due simply to their lessened </td></tr>

<tr><td>of this lower part, as I conclude from my experiments with </td></tr>

<tr><td>points, signifies very little, for I have no doubt that your book </td></tr>
<tr><td>will convince most botanists that I am wrong in all the points </td></tr>
<tr><td>on which we differ. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Independently of the question of transmission, my mind is </td></tr>
<tr><td>so full of facts leading me to believe that light, gravity, &c., </td></tr>
<tr><td>act not in a direct manner on growth, but as stimuli, that I </td></tr>
<tr><td>am quite unable to modify my judgment on this head. I </td></tr>

<tr><td>my son George, who is a mathematician. He supposes that </td></tr>
<tr><td>your objection is founded on the diffused light from the lamp </td></tr>
<tr><td>illuminating both sides of the object, and not being reduced, </td></tr>
<tr><td>with increasing distance in the same ratio as the direct light ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>but he doubts whether this necessary correction will account </td></tr>
<tr><td>for the very little difference in the heliotropic curvature of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>plants in the successive pots. </td></tr>
<tr><td>With respect to the sensitiveness of the tips of roots to </td></tr>
<tr><td>contact, I cannot admit your view until it is proved that I am </td></tr>
<tr><td>in error about bits of card attached by liquid gum causing </td></tr>
<tr><td>movement ; whereas no movement was caused if the card </td></tr>
<tr><td>remained separated from the tip by a layer of the liquid gum. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The fact also of thicker and thinner bits of card attached on </td></tr>
<tr><td>opposite sides of the same root by shellac, causing movement </td></tr>
<tr><td>in one direction, has to be explained. You often speak of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>tip having been injured ; but externally there was no sign of </td></tr>
<tr><td>injury : and when the tip was plainly injured, the extreme </td></tr>
<tr><td>part became curved towards the injured side. I can no more </td></tr>

<tr><td>on the subject Now for the last ten years I have been </td></tr>
<tr><td>experimenting in crossing and self-fertilising plants ; and one </td></tr>
<tr><td>indirect result has surprised me much ; namely, that by taking </td></tr>
<tr><td>pains to cultivate plants in pots under glass during several </td></tr>
<tr><td>successive generations, under nearly similar conditions, and by </td></tr>
<tr><td>self-fertilising them in each generation, the colour of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>flowers often changes, and, what is very remarkable, they </td></tr>
<tr><td>became in some of the most variable species, such as Mimulus, </td></tr>
<tr><td>Carnation, &c., quite constant, like those of a wild species. </td></tr>
<tr><td>This fact and several others have led me to the suspicion </td></tr>
<tr><td>that the cause of variation must be in different substances </td></tr>
<tr><td>absorbed from the soil by these plants when their powers of </td></tr>
<tr><td>absorption are not interfered with by other plants with which </td></tr>
<tr><td>they grow mingled in a state of nature. Therefore my son </td></tr>
<tr><td>and I wish to grow plants in pots in soil entirely, or as nearly </td></tr>
<tr><td>entirely as is possible, destitute of all matter which plants </td></tr>
<tr><td>absorb, and then to give during several successive generations </td></tr>
<tr><td>to several plants of the same species as different solutions as </td></tr>
<tr><td>may be compatible with their life and health. And now, can </td></tr>
<tr><td>you advise me how to make soil approximately free of all the </td></tr>
<tr><td>substances which plants naturally absorb ? I suppose white </td></tr>
<tr><td>silver sand, sold for cleaning harness, &c., is nearly pure silica, </td></tr>
<tr><td>but what am I to do for alumina ? Without some alumina I </td></tr>
<tr><td>imagine that it would be impossible to keep the soil damp </td></tr>
<tr><td>and fit for the growth of plants. I presume that clay washed </td></tr>
<tr><td>over and over again in water would still yield mineral matter </td></tr>
<tr><td>to the carbonic acid secreted by the roots. I should want a </td></tr>
<tr><td>good deal of soil, for it would be useless to experimentise </td></tr>
<tr><td>unless we could fill from twenty to thirty moderately sized </td></tr>
<tr><td>flower-pots every year. Can you suggest any plan ? for unless </td></tr>
<tr><td>you can it would, I fear, be useless for us to commence an </td></tr>
<tr><td>attempt to discover whether variability depends at all on </td></tr>
<tr><td>matter absorbed from the soil. After obtaining the requisite </td></tr>
<tr><td>kind of soil, my notion is to water one set of plants with </td></tr>

<tr><td>[1881. </td></tr>
<tr><td>nitrate of potassium, another set with nitrate of sodium, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>another with nitrate of lime, giving all as much phosphate of </td></tr>
<tr><td>ammonia as they seemed to support, for I wish the plants to </td></tr>
<tr><td>grow as luxuriantly as possible. The plants watered with </td></tr>
<tr><td>nitrate of Na and of Ca would require, I suppose, some K ; but </td></tr>
<tr><td>perhaps they would get what is absolutely necessary from such </td></tr>
<tr><td>soil as I should be forced to employ, and from the rain-water </td></tr>
<tr><td>collected in tanks. I could use hard water from a deep well </td></tr>
<tr><td>in the chalk, but then all the plants would get lime. If the </td></tr>

<tr><td>he produced by cultivating certain plants under unnatural </td></tr>
<tr><td>conditions, as the presence of salt, lime, zinc, &c., &c., during </td></tr>
<tr><td>several generations. Plants, moreover, were selected which </td></tr>
<tr><td>were the most likely to vary under such conditions, judging </td></tr>
<tr><td>from the existence of closely-allied forms adapted for these </td></tr>
<tr><td>conditions. No doubt I originally attributed too little weight </td></tr>
<tr><td>to the direct action of conditions, but Hoffmann���s paper has </td></tr>
<tr><td>staggered me. Perhaps hundreds of generations of exposure </td></tr>
<tr><td>are necessary. It is a most perplexing subject I wish </td></tr>
<tr><td>I was not so old, and had more strength, for I see lines </td></tr>
<tr><td>of research to follow. Hoffmann even doubts whether </td></tr>
<tr><td>plants vary more under cultivation than in their native home </td></tr>
<tr><td>and under their natural conditions. If so, the astonishing </td></tr>
<tr><td>variations of almost all cultivated plants must be due to </td></tr>
<tr><td>selection and breeding from the varying individuals. This </td></tr>
<tr><td>idea crossed my mind many years ago, but I was afraid to </td></tr>
<tr><td>publish it, as I thought that people would say, ��� how he does </td></tr>
<tr><td>exaggerate the importance of selection.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>I still must believe that changed conditions give the impulse </td></tr>
<tr><td>to variability, but that they act in most cases in a very </td></tr>

<tr><td>Mr. Torbitt���s Experiments on the Potato-Disease. </td></tr>
<tr><td>[Mr. James Torbitt, of Belfast, has been engaged for the </td></tr>
<tr><td>last twelve years in the difficult undertaking, in which he has </td></tr>
<tr><td>been to a large extent successful, of raising fungus-proof </td></tr>
<tr><td>varieties of the potato. My father felt great interest in Mr. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Torbitt���s work, and corresponded with him from 1876 on- </td></tr>
<tr><td>wards. The following letter, giving a clear account of Mr. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Torbitt���s method and of my father���s opinion of the probability </td></tr>
<tr><td>of its success, was written with the idea that Government </td></tr>
<tr><td>aid for the work might possibly be obtainable :] </td></tr>
<tr><td>C. Darwin to T. H. Farrer. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Down, March 2, 1878. </td></tr>
<tr><td>My DEAR Farrer, ��� Mr. Torbitt���s plan of overcoming the </td></tr>
<tr><td>potato-disease seems to me by far the best which has ever </td></tr>
<tr><td>been suggested. It consists, as you know from his printed </td></tr>
<tr><td>letter, of rearing a vast number of seedlings from cross-fertil- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ised parents, exposing them to infection, ruthlessly destroying </td></tr>
<tr><td>all that suffer, saving those which resist best, and repeating </td></tr>
<tr><td>the process in successive seminal generations. My belief in </td></tr>
<tr><td>the probability of good results from this process rests on the </td></tr>
<tr><td>fact of all characters whatever occasionally varying. It is </td></tr>
<tr><td>known, for instance, that certain species and varieties of the </td></tr>
<tr><td>vine resist phylloxera better than others. Andrew Knight </td></tr>
<tr><td>found one variety or species of the apple which was not in </td></tr>
<tr><td>the least attacked by coccus, and another variety has been </td></tr>
<tr><td>observed in South Australia. Certain varieties of the peach </td></tr>
<tr><td>resist mildew, and several other such cases could be given. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Therefore there is no great improbability in a new variety of </td></tr>
<tr><td>potato arising which would resist the fungus completely, or </td></tr>
<tr><td>at least much better than any existing variety. With respect </td></tr>
<tr><td>to the cross-fertilisation of two distinct seedling plants, it has </td></tr>
<tr><td>been ascertained that the offspring thus raised inherit much </td></tr>
<tr><td>�� The Complete Work of Charles Darwin Online </td></tr>
<tr><td>i8 7 8.] </td></tr>
<tr><td>BOTANICAL LETTERS. </td></tr>
<tr><td>349 </td></tr>
<tr><td>more vigorous constitutions and generally are more prolific </td></tr>
<tr><td>than seedlings from self-fertilised parents. It is also probable </td></tr>
<tr><td>that cross-fertilisation would be especially valuable in the </td></tr>
<tr><td>case of the potato, as there is reason to believe that the </td></tr>
<tr><td>flowers are seldom crossed by our native insects ; and some </td></tr>
<tr><td>varieties are absolutely sterile unless fertilised with pollen </td></tr>
<tr><td>from a distinct variety. There is some evidence that the good </td></tr>
<tr><td>effects from a cross are transmitted for several generations ; </td></tr>
<tr><td>it would not, therefore be necessary to cross-fertilise the </td></tr>
<tr><td>seedlings in each generation, though this would be desirable, </td></tr>
<tr><td>as it is almost certain that a greater number of seeds would </td></tr>
<tr><td>thus be obtained. It should be remembered that a cross </td></tr>
<tr><td>between plants raised from the tubers of the same plant, </td></tr>
<tr><td>though growing on distinct roots, does no more good than a </td></tr>
<tr><td>cross between flowers on the same individual. Considering </td></tr>
<tr><td>the whole subject, it appears to me that it would be a national </td></tr>
<tr><td>misfortune if the cross-fertilised seeds in Mr. Torbitt���s posses- </td></tr>
<tr><td>sion produced by parents which have already shown some </td></tr>
<tr><td>power of resisting the disease, are not utilised by the Govern- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ment, or some public body, and the process of selection </td></tr>
<tr><td>continued during several more generations. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Should the Agricultural Society undertake the work, Mr. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Torbitt���s knowledge gained by experience would be especially </td></tr>
<tr><td>valuable ; and an outline of the plan is given in his printed </td></tr>
<tr><td>letter. It would be necessary that all the tubers produced by </td></tr>
<tr><td>each plant should be collected separately, and carefully </td></tr>
<tr><td>examined in each succeeding generation. </td></tr>
<tr><td>It would be advisable that some kind of potato eminently </td></tr>
<tr><td>liable to the disease should be planted in considerable numbers </td></tr>
<tr><td>near the seedlings so as to infect them. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Altogether the trial would be one requiring much care and </td></tr>
<tr><td>extreme patience, as I know from experience with analogous </td></tr>
<tr><td>work, and it may be feared that it would be difficult to find </td></tr>
<tr><td>any one who would pursue the experiment with sufficient </td></tr>
<tr><td>energy. It seems, therefore, to me highly desirable that </td></tr>

<tr><td>crowned in so short a time with more success than could </td></tr>
<tr><td>have been anticipated ; and I think you will agree with me, </td></tr>

<tr><td>[After further consultation with Sir Thomas Farrer and </td></tr>

<tr><td>Botany,��� 1887, p. 1 5 1. Mr. Jackson quotes the following state- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ment by Sir J. D. Hooker : ��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>"Shortly before his death, Mr. Charles Darwin informed </td></tr>
<tr><td>Sir Joseph Hooker that it was his intention to devote </td></tr>
<tr><td>a considerable sum of money annually for some years in </td></tr>
<tr><td>aid or furtherance of some work or works of practical </td></tr>
<tr><td>utility to biological science, and to make provisions in his </td></tr>
<tr><td>will in the event of these not being completed during his </td></tr>
<tr><td>lifetime. </td></tr>
<tr><td>��� Amongst other objects connected with botanical science, </td></tr>
<tr><td>Mr. Darwin regarded with especial interest the importance of </td></tr>
<tr><td>a complete index to the names and authors of the genera and </td></tr>
<tr><td>species of plants known to botanists, together with their </td></tr>
<tr><td>native countries. Steudel���s * Nomenclator ��� is the only existing </td></tr>

<tr><td>old, Mr. Darwin had found it of great aid in his own re- </td></tr>
<tr><td>searches. It has been indispensable to every botanical insti- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tution, whether as a list of all known flowering plants, as an </td></tr>
<tr><td>indication of their authors, or as a digest of botanical </td></tr>

<tr><td>My father, like other botanists, had as Sir Joseph Hooker </td></tr>
<tr><td>points out, experienced the value of Steudel���s work. He </td></tr>
<tr><td>obtained plants from all sorts of sources, which were often </td></tr>
<tr><td>incorrectly named, and he felt the necessity of adhering to </td></tr>
<tr><td>the accepted nomenclature, so that he might convey to other </td></tr>
<tr><td>workers precise indications as to the plants which he had </td></tr>
<tr><td>studied. It was also frequently a matter of importance to </td></tr>
<tr><td>him to know the native country of his experimental plants. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Thus it was natural that he should recognize the desirability of </td></tr>
<tr><td>completing and publishing the interleaved volume at Kew. </td></tr>
<tr><td>The wish to help in this object was heightened by the admira- </td></tr>
<tr><td>tion he felt for the results for which the world has to thank </td></tr>

<tr><td>CHAPTER XIII. </td></tr>
<tr><td>CONCLUSION. </td></tr>
<tr><td>SOME idea of the general course of my father���s health may </td></tr>
<tr><td>have been gathered from the letters given in the preceding </td></tr>
<tr><td>pages. The subject of health appears more prominently </td></tr>
<tr><td>than is often necessary in a Biography, because it was, </td></tr>
<tr><td>unfortunately, so real an element in determining the outward </td></tr>
<tr><td>form of his life. </td></tr>
<tr><td>During the last ten years of his life the state of his health </td></tr>
<tr><td>was a cause of satisfaction and hope to his family. His con- </td></tr>
<tr><td>dition showed signs of amendment in several particulars. </td></tr>
<tr><td>He suffered less distress and discomfort, and was able to </td></tr>
<tr><td>work more steadily. Something has been already said of </td></tr>
<tr><td>Dr. Bence Jones���s treatment, from which my father certainly </td></tr>
<tr><td>derived benefit. In later years he became a patient of </td></tr>
<tr><td>Sir Andrew Clark, under whose care he improved greatly </td></tr>
<tr><td>in general health. It was not only for his generously ren- </td></tr>
<tr><td>dered service that my father felt a debt of gratitude towards </td></tr>
<tr><td>Sir Andrew Clark. He owed to his cheering personal </td></tr>
<tr><td>influence an often-repeated encouragement, which latterly </td></tr>
<tr><td>added something real to his happiness, and he found sincere </td></tr>
<tr><td>pleasure in Sir Andrew���s friendship and kindness towards </td></tr>
<tr><td>himself and his children. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Scattered through the past pages are one or two references </td></tr>
<tr><td>to pain or uneasiness felt in the region of the heart. How </td></tr>
<tr><td>far these indicate that the heart was affected early in life, </td></tr>
<tr><td>I cannot pretend to say ; in any case it is certain that he </td></tr>
<tr><td>had no serious or permanent trouble of this nature until </td></tr>

<tr><td>shortly before his death. In spite of the general improve- </td></tr>
<tr><td>ment in his health, which has been above alluded to, there </td></tr>
<tr><td>was a certain loss of physical vigour occasionally apparent </td></tr>
<tr><td>during the last few years of his life. This is illustrated by </td></tr>
<tr><td>a sentence in a letter to his old friend Sir James Sulivan, </td></tr>
<tr><td>written on January 10, 1879: ���My scientific work tires me </td></tr>
<tr><td>more than it used to do, but I have nothing else to do, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>whether one is worn out a year or two sooner or later signi- </td></tr>
<tr><td>fies but little.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>A similar feeling is shown in a letter to Sir J. D. Hooker </td></tr>
<tr><td>of June 15, 1881. My father was staying at Patterdale, and </td></tr>
<tr><td>wrote : ���I am rather despondent about myself .... I have </td></tr>
<tr><td>not the heart or strength to begin any investigation lasting </td></tr>
<tr><td>years, which is the only thing which I enjoy, and I have no </td></tr>
<tr><td>little jobs which I can do.��� </td></tr>
<tr><td>In July, 1881, he wrote to Mr. Wallace, ���We have just </td></tr>
<tr><td>returned home after spending five weeks on Ullswater ; the </td></tr>
<tr><td>scenery is quite charming, but I cannot walk, and everything </td></tr>
<tr><td>tires me, even seeing scenery .... What I shall do with my </td></tr>
<tr><td>few remaining years of life I can hardly tell. I have every- </td></tr>
<tr><td>thing to make me happy and contented, but life has become </td></tr>
<tr><td>very wearisome to me.��� He was, however, able to do a good </td></tr>
<tr><td>deal of work, and that of a trying sort,* during the autumn </td></tr>
<tr><td>of 1881, but towards the end of the year he was clearly in </td></tr>
<tr><td>need of rest ; and during the winter was in a lower condition </td></tr>
<tr><td>than was usual with him. </td></tr>
<tr><td>On December 13, he went for a week to his daughter's </td></tr>
<tr><td>house in Bryanston Street. During his stay in London he </td></tr>
<tr><td>went to call on Mr. Romanes, and was seized when on the </td></tr>
<tr><td>door-step with an attack apparently of the same kind as those </td></tr>
<tr><td>which afterwards became so frequent. The rest of the in- </td></tr>
<tr><td>cident, which I give in Mr. Romanes��� words, is interesting too </td></tr>
<tr><td>from a different point of view, as giving one more illustration </td></tr>
<tr><td>of my father���s scrupulous consideration for others : ��� </td></tr>

<tr><td>prefer going home, and although the butler urged him to </td></tr>
<tr><td>wait at least until a cab could be fetched, he said he would </td></tr>
<tr><td>rather not give so much trouble. For the same reason he </td></tr>
<tr><td>refused to allow the butler to accompany him. Accordingly </td></tr>
<tr><td>he watched him walking with difficulty towards the direction </td></tr>
<tr><td>in which cabs were to be met with, and saw that, when he </td></tr>
<tr><td>had got about three hundred yards from the house, he stag- </td></tr>
<tr><td>gered and caught hold of the park-railings as if to prevent </td></tr>
<tr><td>himself from falling. The butler therefore hastened to his </td></tr>
<tr><td>assistance, but after a few seconds saw him turn round with </td></tr>
<tr><td>the evident purpose of retracing his steps to my house. How- </td></tr>
